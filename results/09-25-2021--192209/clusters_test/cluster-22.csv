"Methods and Tools for Integrating Pathomics Data into Cancer Registries The goal of this project is to enrich SEER registry data with high‐quality population‐based biospecimen data in the form of digital pathology, machine learning based classifications and quantitative pathomics feature sets. We will create a well‐curated repository of high‐quality digitized pathology images for subjects whose data is being collected by the registries. These images will be processed to extract computational features and establish deep linkages with registry data, thus enabling the creation of information‐rich, population cohorts containing objective imaging and clinical attributes. Specific examples of digital Pathology derived feature sets include quantification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and segmentation and characterization of cancer or stromal nuclei. Features will also include spectral and spatial signatures of the underlying pathology. The scientific premise for this approach stems from increasing evidence that information extracted from digitized pathology images (pathomic features) are a quantitative surrogate of what is described in a pathology report. The important distinction being that these features are quantitative and reproducible, unlike human observations that are highly qualitative and subject to a high degree of inter‐ and intra‐observer variability. This dataset will provide, a unique, population‐wide tissue based view of cancer, and dramatically accelerate our understanding of the stages of disease progression, cancer outcomes, and predict and assess therapeutic effectiveness.  This work will be carried out in collaboration with three SEER registries. We will partner with The New Jersey State Cancer Registry during the development phase of the project (UG3). During the validation phase of the project (UH3), the Georgia and Kentucky State Cancer Registries will join the project. The infrastructure will be developed in close collaboration with SEER registries to ensure consistency with registry processes, scalability and ability support creation of population cohorts that span multiple registries. We will deploy visual analytic tools to facilitate the creation of population cohorts for epidemiological studies, tools to support visualization of feature clusters and related whole‐slide images while providing advanced algorithms for conducting content based image retrieval. The scientific validation of the proposed environment will be undertaken through three studies in Prostate Cancer, Lymphoma and NSCLC, led by investigators at the three sites.

"Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the 6th leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Although up to 40% of adult patients are responsive to standard chemotherapy, almost all relapse and progress to resistant disease. Most AML patients display no cytogenetic abnormalities or driver mutations, which poses a significant challenge for designing targeted therapy. Combination therapy may also be useful for preventing resistance and improving overall survival. Recent advances in epigenomics have shed light on cellular reprogramming in cancer. Epigenetic proteins can modulate gene expression to induce pathways that increase cell proliferation and decrease differentiation. Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is an epigenetic protein overexpressed in AML. CARM1 has been identified as a key regulator of myeloid differentiation and cancer progression; and is overexpressed in primary, resistant, and recurrent AML. CARM1’s mechanistic role in AML induction and progression (including relevant substrates and regulation) is still unclear, which presents an additional challenge for clinicians to design new therapies. To address gaps in our current understanding of CARM1 function and the need for new AML therapies, I aim to (1) Identify compounds that target CARM1 expression and compounds that work in synergy with a known CARM1 inhibitor in AML and (2) Identify novel chemotypes that directly inhibit CARM1 using a hybrid approach of machine learning and simulations of small molecule-protein interactions. These aims support key goals of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Precision Medicine Initiative, including (1) understanding cancer progression, (2) genomic analysis, (3) advancing precision medicine, (4) bioinformatics and (5) translational research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the bone marrow, where immature cells accumulate and disrupt the production of normal blood cells, disrupting normal blood formation and organ function. Despite advances in research, AML patients are typically treated with chemotherapy agents that often fail to cure them and frequently lead to relapse. We propose to create new therapies for repressing AML based on targeting the epigenome, or the pattern of chemical modification of DNA and histones, the proteins that package and order DNA to promote gene expression.",Novel Therapeutics Targeting CARM1 Overexpression in AML,10056204,F31CA228331,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affinity', 'Apoptosis', 'Arginine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood Cells', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Modification Process', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease Resistance', 'Docking', 'Down-Regulation', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Synergism', 'Embryonic Development', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histones', 'Hybrids', 'In Vitro', 'In complete remission', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Bone Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Myelogenous', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Network-based', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Probability', 'Production', 'Protein Methyltransferases', 'Proteins', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Series', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'acute myeloid leukemia cell', 'analog', 'base', 'blood formation', 'chemotherapy', 'coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1', 'design', 'driver mutation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'overexpression', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor progression', 'virtual']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,F31,2021,51036
"Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will (1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial (standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4) analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness, familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have previously developed a computer decision support system for (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. If successfully deployed and utilized, CDSS-T will be a useful tool to aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor treatment response assessment. Improving the reliability in assessment of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying patients who do not respond to preserve their physical condition, thus allowing them to seek alternative treatment, which may reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from bladder cancer. In addition, the multi-site pilot clinical trial will provide an excellent opportunity to experience the process of bringing laboratory research from bench to bedside, which will serve as a valuable guide for future development of clinically practical tools for various diseases.",Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer,10152531,U01CA232931,"['Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratory Research', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2021,625260
"Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy The long-term goal of this P01 is to understand the intersection of radiation biology and cancer immunology and to translate this research into better therapies with curative potential for patients with cancer. Radiation therapy (RT) can systemically impact the immune system, and recent clinical success of PD1 and CTLA4 immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has given rise to our overarching hypothesis that the immune stimulatory effects of RT can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with dual ICB across multiple histologies. Our preliminary data and investigative approach bridges studies in both patients and animal models. To achieve our goals, we have developed three Projects, which require close coordination of projects and cores. In Project 1, we will determine the clinical and immunological impact of treating patients on two clinical trials: (i) nivolumab (PD1 mAb) and ipilimumab (CTLA4 mAb) with or without hypofractionated RT (HFRT) in a randomized phase II study in metastatic melanoma; and (ii) and tremelimumab (CTLA4 mAb) and durvalumab (PDL1 mAb) with HFRT at two dose schedules in metastatic pancreatic, lung, and breast carcinoma. In Project 2, we will determine the role of RT in establishing cancer immunity, evaluating the mechanism of anti-viral signaling through pattern recognition receptors and non-coding RNA and examining dendritic cell biology and CD40 activation. In Project 3, we will define the genetic and epigenetic basis of resistance to RT and ICB and examine PDL1 independent pathways to overcome this. Biomarkers revealed in Projects 2 and 3 will be examined using human samples from the clinical trials in Project 1. The Cores for this P01 are essential for our progress including provision of administration support for collaboration (Core A), a state-of-the-art platform for small animal radiation (Core B), and bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to drive deep learning from data generated in all Projects (Core C). The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer. Overall Narrative Our goal is to demonstrate that the immune stimulatory effects of radiation therapy (RT) can expand the spectrum of clinical responsiveness when combined with CTLA-4 and PD-1 across multiple histologies. Our approach involves two immediate clinical trials, mechanistic studies in human samples, mechanistic and discovery studies in mouse models, and sharing of data and scientific insight between 3 Projects and 3 Cores. The potential for paradigm shifting impact is to transform the indication of RT from “local therapy” to key part of a novel “systemic” immune therapy for meaningful efficacy against metastatic and advanced cancer.  ",Radiation and checkpoint blockade for cancer immune therapy,10005144,P01CA210944,"['Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'CTLA4 blockade', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Discipline', 'Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm', 'Dose', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferons', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Ligands', 'Local Therapy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Metastatic Melanoma', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nivolumab', 'PD-1 blockade', 'Pancreatic carcinoma', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Phase', 'Preclinical Testing', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Interaction', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiobiology', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systemic Therapy', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Translating', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Immunity', 'Untranslated RNA', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'epigenomics', 'exhaust', 'exhaustion', 'immune activation', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunoregulation', 'insight', 'ipilimumab', 'irradiation', 'lung Carcinoma', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'phase 2 study', 'phase I trial', 'preclinical efficacy', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'programs', 'radiation effect', 'radiation response', 'randomized trial', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'success', 'synergism', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,P01,2021,2275599
"Administrative Supplement: Integrative analysis of lung cancer etiology and risk RFA: PA-18-842 (NOT-CA-20-006) Title: Administrative Supplement: Integrative analysis of lung cancer etiology and risk Project Summary/Abstract Over the past two decades, many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed that most common diseases have a polygenic architecture, wherein multiple genetic variants with small genetic effect cumulatively impact disease development. Advances in statistical, epidemiological, and clinical genetics enable to demonstrate the power of polygenic risk profiles in form of polygenic risk scores to define individuals at high- and low-risk of disease. However, most genetic research carried out to date has focused on genetically homogeneous studies from European populations given the limited availability of samples in populations of diverse ancestry and due to confounding from variability in allelic proportions among diverse populations. This implies that GWAS in ethnic disparities are not fully understood. The goals of this proposal are to leverage genetic diversity to develop and refine PRS by addressing the ancestral diversity in African American population that are not well-represented in genetic research; and to elucidate individual and system-level factors affecting disparities in access and participation of African- Americans in lung cancer genomic testing for polygenic risk, engagement with return of results, and uptake of lung cancer polygenic risk score information in clinical care. We postulate that the ancestry-specific and disease subtypes-specific polygenic models can greatly improve risk prediction to identify high- to low-risk individuals of disease development in terms of prevention and management of the disease. The proposal capitalizes on large-scale existing well-genotyped and phenotype dataset using ancestry-specific, disease subset-based, linkage disequilibrium score regression, and machine-learning association analysis to achieve the a “cancer health disparities” principle and to increase prediction accuracy in African American population. In addition, identifying the individual and system –level factors affecting disparities in lung cancer genomic testing for polygenic risk will inform development of more targeted interventions to improve access, participation, and engagement, which could not only enhance model prediction but also have salutary downstream impact by elucidating strategies to improve African-American engagement in cancer genomic testing.

"Integrated Informatic and Experimental Evaluations of Cancer Chronotherapy ABSTRACT Years of clinical experience and a growing body of basic research suggest that chemotherapeutic activity can change with time-of-day. But when should our patients take their medicines? Must we test each new agent for circadian modulation in both efficacy and toxicity? Which tumors are most sensitive to chemotherapy administration time? Can we tailor our recommendations for individual patients? Temporal variation in the abundance of drug targets, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes, in both tumors and normal tissues, underlies circadian variation in drug activity. Until recently almost all we knew about tissue specific circadian rhythms came from normal mice. Without human data, a mechanistic, hypothesis-driven transition to medical practice has been slow. Recently we developed CYCLOPS (CYCLic Ordering by Periodic Structure) a machine-learning algorithm to uncover human transcriptional oscillations using existing, unordered biopsy samples. We used CYCLOPS to explore circadian rhythms in human lung and liver, identify disrupted rhythms in hepatocellular carcinoma, and predict circadian changes in drug effectiveness. This proposal will greatly expand that work and accelerate its translation to clinical oncology. Using public data, we will describe the molecular rhythms in an array of normal human tissues and thus the times of day when these tissues are least sensitive to specific drug toxicities. We will also describe rhythms in select tumors, identifying circadian times and cell cycle phases when cancers are most distinct from surrounding tissue and thus uniquely sensitive to various treatments. We will explore the influence of specific mutations and tumor markers on the rhythms observed in patients. Mapping these data onto pharmacogenomics databases we can make testable prediction as to the drugs and side effects most influenced by circadian time. Finally using both experimental mouse data and our preliminary human results, we have compiled a list of some of the most promising chronotheraputic candidates. We will expand and refine this list over the course of the study, testing several of these predictions in established animal models, and exploring the promise and practical principles of cancer chronotherapy. Taken together these aims will help catalyze chronotheraputic translation to clinical oncology and help delineate the role of time in precision cancer therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Circadian, or daily, rhythms influence nearly every aspect of our physiology. The influence of daily rhythms on cancer biology and treatment is particularly strong. This work will help physicians time the administration of chemotherapy and will allow researchers to better understand how cancer physiology changes with time-of-day",Integrated Informatic and Experimental Evaluations of Cancer Chronotherapy,10130460,R01CA227485,"['Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptotic', 'Basic Science', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Model', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chronotherapy', 'Circadian Dysregulation', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Colon', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Side Effects', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Transport', 'Drug toxicity', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Effectiveness', 'Enzymes', 'Esophagus', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Intestines', 'Islet Cell Tumor', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Metabolism', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms', 'New Agents', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Phase', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Recommendation', 'Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Pathway', 'Site', 'Stomach', 'Streptozocin', 'Structure', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Index', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Tumor Markers', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'circadian', 'circadian pacemaker', 'clinically significant', 'dosage', 'experience', 'gene product', 'human data', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidimensional data', 'neoplastic', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'reconstruction', 'side effect', 'transcriptome', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,599614
"SERS diagnostics platform for liquid bioapsy analysis of tumor-associated exosomes Project Summary/Abstract For ovarian cancer (OvCa), only 27% of women diagnosed at advanced stages survive 5 years, yet more than 90% of patients survive when diagnosed at an earlier stage. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new non- invasive technologies capable of rapidly diagnosing ovarian cancers (OvCa) in early stage. Fortuitously, all cells (and tumor cells to a greater extent) expel nanoscale vesicles that are directly reflective of the biological state of their parent cells. A subset of circulating EVs known as exosomes are composed of biomolecules spanning the range of lipids, proteins, genes, and more, and hold great potential for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Yet current methods for phenotyping biofluids according to detection of tumor-associated exosomes (TEXs) are not meeting clinical standards and fail to precisely capture particle to particle heterogeneity. We propose to develop a new nanoplasmonics-based technology for sensitive detection of cancer-related exosome bio-signatures enabled by multiplexed surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, that we call ExoSERS. Our approach encompasses three aims devised to realize the ExoSERS platform. Aim 1 outlines development of a new class of Raman-active ligands to serve as the molecular barcodes. This aim encompasses the design and synthesis of polyyne-based ligands designed to confer Raman spectroscopic encoding and also initiate a silane coating to form a protecting shell around a nanoplasmonic core. Aim 2 describes the synthesis and optimization of nanoplasmonic core-shell structures that will be well-suited to binding EVs. An inner gold core structure yields plasmonic enhancement, while the outer silica shell permits long-term stability and a convenient surface for covalent decoration with exosome and cancer-specific surface marker targeting agents. Aim 3 comprises validation of the platform’s feasibility to profile human OvCa patient plasma, including machine learning approaches to type cancers using the barcoded approach. Endpoints of platform characterization will be statistical validation of exosome detection efficiency, minimal sample volume needed, ease of utilization, and low cost. Several quantitative milestones have been proposed to gauge our progress and provide deliverables to the larger diagnostic and circulating biomarker communities. Project Narrative All cells dynamically excrete into circulation nano-sized packages called extracellular vesicles (EVs), but this pathway can be hijacked by cancer cells for means of immune system suppression and metastasis. Innovative cross-disciplinary engineering methods are urgently needed to realize the diagnostic application of circulating cancer EVs to improve early detection of diseases like ovarian cancer, which do not have effective early screening tests. This project encompasses the design of highly multiplexed new nanoplasmonic probes for sensitive chemical fingerprinting of targeted circulating EVs, to ultimately improve the limit of detection for diagnosing ovarian cancer compared to conventional methods.",SERS diagnostics platform for liquid bioapsy analysis of tumor-associated exosomes,10145619,R01CA241666,"['Address', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'CA-125 Antigen', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fingerprint', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune system', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nanostructures', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Silanes', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Vesicle', 'Width', 'Woman', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'biomarker evaluation', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer drug resistance', 'cancer type', 'chemical fingerprinting', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'detection limit', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic platform', 'diagnostic technologies', 'early screening', 'exosome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'innovation', 'liquid biopsy', 'minimally invasive', 'multiplex detection', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nanoparticle', 'nanoplasmonic', 'nanoscale', 'nanosized', 'neoplastic cell', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'particle', 'plasmonics', 'rapid diagnosis', 'recruit', 'small molecule', 'targeted agent', 'tumor', 'tumor growth', 'vesicle transport', 'vesicular release']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,533280
"Integrative genomic and epigenomic analysis of cancer using long read sequencing PROJECT SUMMARY The last twenty years have experienced extensive growth in the sequencing of cancer genomes, leading to a dramatically increased understanding of the role of genetic and epigenetic mutations in cancer. This has largely been enabled by developments in high-throughput “second-generation” sequencing technology and analysis that characterize cancer genomes using short-reads. Recently, a new generation of high-throughput long-read sequencing instruments, primarily from Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore, have become available that are poised to displace short-read sequencing for many applications. We and others have used these technologies to discover tens of thousands of variants per cancer genome that are not detectable using short-reads, including structural variants and differentially methylated regions in known oncogenes and cancer risk genes. These technologies carry the potential to address many open questions in cancer biology, however, the analysis of long-read sequencing data is computationally demanding and needs specialized algorithms that are either too inefficient to use at scale or do not yet exist. In this proposal, we will address several gaps in the application of long-read technology for basic research and clinical use in cancer genomics. First, we will develop improved methods for finding structural variants and complex repeat expansions from long-reads, both of which are major diagnostic and prognostic indicators of disease, yet are not accurately identified using existing methods. Leveraging the improved phasing capabilities of long reads, this work will include the detection of mosaic variants, revealing tumor heterogeneity and variants in precancerous tissues. Next, we will apply machine learning and systems level advances to accelerate and improve the comparison of variants across large patient cohorts. Critically, this will compensate for the error prone nature of single molecule long-read sequencing to make these comparisons more accurate when comparing tumor-normal samples or pedigrees of related patients so that recurrent driving mutations can be accurately identified. Finally, we will develop integrative methods for the joint analysis of genome, transcriptome, and epigenetic profiling of cancer genomes. These advances will improve the identification of fusion genes, and allow for entirely new forms of epigenetic analysis, such as the allele-specific analysis of methylation across transposable elements and other repetitive elements. Synthesizing the many thousands of novel variants we will detect using our methods, we will then develop algorithms that will identify and evaluate recurrent genetic or epigenetic variations as putative driving mutations. All methods will be released open-source and will empower us, our ITCR collaborators, and the cancer genomics community at large to study genetic and epigenetic variants with near perfect accuracy and thereby unlock many new associations to treatment and disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Emerging long-read single molecule sequencing platforms are poised to establish a new level of quality and resolution in cancer genome sequencing. Here we will develop and enhance algorithms for several important tasks in genomics with long reads, including improved genetic variation detection, transcriptional profiling, and methylation analysis. We will then work with our collaborators and other researchers to deploy these methods to develop a more complete understanding of cancer progression.",Integrative genomic and epigenomic analysis of cancer using long read sequencing,10187808,U01CA253481,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Automobile Driving', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancerous', 'Cataloging', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Cytosine', 'DNA Sequence Rearrangement', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Karyotype', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Minisatellite Repeats', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Recurrence', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'System', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'disorder risk', 'driver mutation', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'fusion gene', 'genetic pedigree', 'genetic variant', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'methylome', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'power analysis', 'premalignant', 'risk variant', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,383463
"PROTEAN-CR: Proteomics Toolkit for Ensemble Analysis in Cancer Research Project Summary Understanding protein–ligand molecular interactions is fundamental to understanding the role of proteins in complex diseases such as cancer. For instance, there is growing interest in predicting the binding modes of peptide-based ligands (e.g., cyclic and phosphorylated peptides) to inhibit or induce targeted degradation of high-proﬁle cancer targets. Another promising example is the identiﬁcation of tumor-associated antigens for cancer immunotherapy applications. Both examples involve very speciﬁc molecular interactions, provide opportunities for computer-aided design of better cancer treatments, and highlight the need for structural analyses in cancer research. They also require new methods that account for the ﬂexibility and variability of the protein receptors involved in these molecular interactions. The objective of this project is to develop an integrated approach to the structural modeling and analysis of protein–ligand interactions in cancer research that will be implemented in the proteomics toolkit PROTEAN-CR. The proposed toolkit will adopt a data-science approach to the problem by introducing approaches for data acquisition and aggregation, as well as algorithmic advances for handling receptor ﬂexibility and for modeling driver mutations, drug-resistance polymorphisms, and post-translational modiﬁcations. PROTEAN-CR will streamline running structural analyses at scale while providing meaningful data analytics. The long-term goal of our research is to fully integrate three-dimensional structural information about proteins and ligands and structural analysis into cancer research. The PIs will work with collaborators to target a wide range of users, from experimentalists with little to no programming experience, to advanced users who are comfortable scripting large-scale analyses and integrating the toolkit with their own computational pipeline. The central hypothesis is that a uniﬁed data-science-inspired approach can be used to address major challenges in structural analysis of protein–ligand interactions in cancer research at scale. The ﬁrst aim will incorporate protein ﬂexibility in docking studies for cancer research. Speciﬁc workﬂows will be used to generate ensembles of protein conformations (receptor ﬂexibility) and innovative machine learning methods will be implemented aiming at a better scoring of protein–ligand complexes. The second aim will focus on including cancer variability into structural analysis. We aim to ﬁll the gap that exists between available data on cancer variants and the structural analysis of ensembles of tumor-associated mutations and protein modiﬁcations. Finally, the third aim will focus on customization, interpretability and scalability, where user-friendly methods will be deployed to manage ensembles of protein-ligand complexes. PROTEAN-CR will be developed focusing on speciﬁc cancer-related projects, and with a broad network of collaborators, enabling the design, implementation and evolution of the tool according to the needs of the cancer research community. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it employs an innovative data-science approach to make molecular structural analysis accessible to cancer researchers. The toolkit that will implement and harden this approach will be made freely available to advance efforts to discover key mechanisms inherent to cancer, enabling the development of new diagnostics and therapeutics. The proposed software toolkit will integrate data acquisition, computation, analytics and visualization with emphasis on three fronts: (a) ﬂexibility, allowing the sampling of conformations taking into account receptor as well as the ligand dynamics; (b) variability, allowing the user to simulate proteins with cancer-associated mutations and post-translational modiﬁcations; and (c) scalability, giving researchers the opportunity to process and analyze large amounts of structural data, using intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.",PROTEAN-CR: Proteomics Toolkit for Ensemble Analysis in Cancer Research,10188196,U01CA258512,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cellular immunotherapy', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Aided Design', 'Computers', 'Country', 'Custom', 'Cyclic Peptides', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug resistance', 'Estrogen Receptors', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Greek', 'HLA Antigens', 'Intuition', 'Letters', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Mutation', 'Mythology', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Peptides', 'Phosphopeptides', 'Phosphorylated Peptide', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'RNA Editing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'driver mutation', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'peptide based vaccine', 'programs', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'scale up', 'screening', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor', 'user-friendly', 'vaccine development', 'web app']",NCI,RICE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,402077
"Characterization and modeling of m6A RNA methylation in cancer ABSTRACT The most abundant internal mRNA modification is N6-methyladenosine (m6A), and growing evidence has suggested its critical roles in cancer. However, the global patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators over large patient cohorts are not available. It remains unclear how m6A RNA modification contributes to cancer initiation/progression and how it may be used in cancer therapy. The objective is to systematically characterize the genome-wide patterns of m6A RNA modification and its regulators using well-characterized The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) patient cohorts, elucidate their interactions with other molecular aberrations, and assess their potential clinical utility. The working hypothesis is that the dysregulation of m6A RNA methylation plays critical roles in cancer development and may represent potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. We will pursue three specific aims: Aim #1. Generate the genome-wide profiles of m6A RNA methylation using TCGA sample cohorts. As part of an NCI Functional Proteomic Center, our team has unique access to these samples. We have developed a sensitive, robust m6A-seq protocol, and will apply it to ~1,000 patient samples from diverse cancer types, and generate high-quality, standardized m6A genome-wide profile data. Aim #2. Generate the protein expression profiles of m6A regulators using TCGA sample cohorts. Using the MD Anderson reverse-phase protein array platform, we will characterize the expression levels of ~30 protein markers (including both total and phosphorylated proteins) of 15 m6A regulators (five writers, two readers, and eight erasers) over ~8,000 samples of 31 cancer types as well as ~400 common cancer cell lines. Aim #3. Perform the integrative analysis and modeling of m6A RNA methylation data in a rich TCGA context. Using TCGA multi-dimensional molecular data, we will develop predictive models that quantify the effects of various factors involved in m6A RNA modification by deep learning. We will perform analyses to define m6A-based tumor subtypes, assess the clinical utility of m6A-related markers, and study the interactions of m6A with other molecular aberrations in diverse tumor contexts. Finally, we will build a publicly available, user-friendly database that will contain comprehensive information of the m6A data generated through Aim #1 and Aim #2. The expected outcome of this project is (i) the establishment of an integrated resource of m6A-related genomic and proteomic data based on the most widely used cancer patient cohorts, so that further investigation of such data can be conducted by the cancer research community fluently; and (ii) assessment of the biological and clinical utility of m6A RNA methylation for cancer therapy in a comprehensive way. This project is innovative because it will systematically assess the clinical relevance and functions of a key class of RNA modifications that are currently understudied in cancer research. These results will have an important positive impact because the knowledge gained will not only greatly advance our understanding of the role of m6A RNA methylation in cancer development, but also directly facilitate the development of a novel class of cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because systematic characterization of RNA modifications in large, well-characterized clinical patient cohorts is expected to advance our understanding of the molecular basis of human cancers, thereby helping the development of more effective treatment approaches. Thus, this project is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that will help to reduce the burdens of human disability.",Characterization and modeling of m6A RNA methylation in cancer,10245143,R01CA251150,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Chicago', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polyadenylation', 'Process', 'Protein Array', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA methylation', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Skin Cancer', 'Standardization', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor Subtype', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'biomedical resource', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'methylation pattern', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R01,2021,550031
"Identifying new drivers of ovarian cancer from the non-coding genome by converging germline risk variants and somatic mutations PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed research training program is to provide tailored additional training to facilitate successful career development throughout the completion of postdoctoral fellowship and the transition to independent tenure track professor. The key elements of this plan are: Candidate: I have considerable research experience in developing and applying computational models to understand complex biological systems. The training component of this proposal will focus on acquisition of knowledge in cancer genetics and genomics, integrative computational methodologies, and next-generation sequencing technologies. Additionally, I will receive training in laboratory management, networking and collaborations, and grant submissions. This well-rounded training plan will accelerate my goals of being an independent researcher and developing computational models to better understand cancer biology. Environment: The training environment at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center fosters productivity and collaboration with world class researchers in clinical and basic biomedical science. I have assembled an advisory committee with esteemed experts in the areas of epigenomics, genetics, data science and cancer biology to ensure my success in this training program and to guide me through the successful acquisition of a tenure track faculty position. These include my mentor Dr. Simon Gayther and four advisors, Dr. Benjamin Berman and Dr. Shelly Lu from Cedars-Sinai, and Dr. Bogdan Pasaniuc, and Dr. Paul Boutros from University of California, Los Angeles. Research: A fundamental goal of human genetics is to decipher the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Cancer is a disease comprising a heritable component that confers cancer predisposition and an acquired (somatic) component where accumulation of genetic alterations occurs during disease development. Population based genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole genome sequencing (WGS) analyses have identified thousands of germline risk variants and somatic non-coding mutations involved in ovarian cancer development. Often, protein-coding cancer driver genes harbor both deleterious germline risk variants and somatic mutations. This proposal hypothesizes that the same is true for non-coding cancer drivers. With the wealth of epigenomics and regulatory datasets, the goal is to identify genomic regions where there are interactions between germline and somatic variants. The specific aims are: (1) identify functional regulatory elements where non-coding germline and somatic ovarian cancer variants co-localize; (2) identify non-coding ovarian cancer drivers through multi-omics regulatory evidence by machine learning models. The proposed studies will establish systematic and quantitative models to identify ovarian cancer non-coding drivers and improve our understanding of disease etiology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Ovarian cancer is responsible for more than 150,000 deaths per year and so it remains a high priority to develop effective prevention approaches and to identify new disease specific therapies to reduce disease mortality. The research proposed here has two components: (1) To characterize the genetic component in ovarian cancer development through epigenomic landscape; (2) to establish the functional relevance of genetic findings for clinical translation. This is a highly integrated multi-disciplinary research proposal, and these approaches to novel discovery and mechanistic understanding are desperately needed to advance our basic knowledge of this disease to develop clinical interventions that reduce mortality.",Identifying new drivers of ovarian cancer from the non-coding genome by converging germline risk variants and somatic mutations,10115485,K99CA256519,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Area', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Assay', 'Buffers', 'California', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cell physiology', 'Cessation of life', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epithelial ovarian cancer', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heritability', 'Human Genetics', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Ovarian', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention approach', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Series', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer initiation', 'cancer predisposition', 'cancer type', 'career development', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'ovarian neoplasm', 'population based', 'precursor cell', 'professor', 'promoter', 'risk variant', 'success', 'tenure track', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis', 'whole genome']",NCI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2021,173048
"Developing new therapeutic strategies for pediatric tumors that lack clinically actionable mutations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cancer is the leading disease-related cause of death in children. Treatment has remained largely unchanged in decades, relying primarily on aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation—these therapies have debilitating long-term consequences. Precision medicine has yet to make a major impact on childhood cancer because, while thousands of pediatric tumor genomes have been sequenced, most children have very few somatic mutations compared to adult cancers. This means targeted cancer drugs are not an option for most children and fewer tumor-specific neoantigens means most immunotherapies are ineffective. However, in the last 5 years, large-scale CRISPR and drug screening studies in cancer cell lines, such as the Dependency Map (DepMap), have shown that in many cancers, unmutated genes can also act as potent drug targets. These genes are known as non-oncogene dependencies. The overall goal of this project is to overcome the low mutation burden, by identifying the druggable non-oncogene dependencies of pediatric tumors and to perform the requisite in vitro and in vivo experimental work to move these therapies to the clinic. We will identify these non-oncogene dependencies by applying tools from machine learning to perform integrative analysis of large pre-clinical screening datasets (such as DepMap, CCLE, and PRISM) with patient tumor -omics data. This will allow us to nominate specific non-oncogene dependencies for pediatric tumor subtypes, defined based on, for example, whole-genome gene expression or methylation data. We will mechanistically validate the top hits using in vitro experimental assays. Additionally, almost all curative cancer treatments involve the rational combination of multiple therapies, however, existing methods to predict effective combinations perform poorly when tested on unseen data. Thus, our second aim is to apply an approach that we have developed based on targeted CRISPR knockout screening to identify synergistic drug combinations. We will validate these combinations in vivo using mouse models with patient-derived xenografts, leveraging shared resources already established at St. Jude. Finally, tumor heterogeneity is ultimately the downfall of every known cancer treatment; however, in pediatric tumors where the mutation burden is low, much of this heterogeneity is driven by cell state, rather than specific somatic mutations. We will dissect the influence of cell state on drug resistance using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics technologies applied to a drug-treated spontaneous mouse model of neuroblastoma. This will ultimately allow us to nominate new drug combinations explicitly targeting drug-resistant cell states. Overall, this research program will aim to build a pipeline at St. Jude to overcome some of the main challenges posed by the low number of somatic mutations in pediatric tumors and identify new therapeutic strategies for these patients. We have assembled a diverse world-class team of researchers with all components necessary for an eventual impact on patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE The treatment of pediatric cancers has remained largely unchanged in decades, relying primarily on aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy and radiation, however, these therapies have debilitating long-term consequences. We will use new computational methodologies applied to large preclinical screening data from cancer cell lines and patient -omics datasets to investigate unmutated genes as potential drug targets in pediatric cancers (non-oncogene dependencies). We will perform the requisite downstream experimental work, including studying drug combinations and resistance mechanisms, necessary to motivate the clinical translation of our findings.",Developing new therapeutic strategies for pediatric tumors that lack clinically actionable mutations,10184211,R01CA260060,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Bone neoplasms', 'CRISPR screen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Cancer Treatment', 'Childhood Solid Neoplasm', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytotoxic Chemotherapy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Encyclopedias', 'Ewings sarcoma', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Knock-out', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Neoplasm', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resource Sharing', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor Subtype', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'actionable mutation', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical translation', 'clinically actionable', 'disorder subtype', 'genome sequencing', 'high risk', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'mouse model', 'neoantigens', 'neuroblastoma cell', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'rapid growth', 'resistance mechanism', 'resistance mutation', 'response', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'synergism', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole genome']",NCI,ST.

"Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data Limitless replicative potential is a key hallmark of cancer and critically depends on telomere maintenance. Many cancers thus aberrantly reactivate the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex that elongates telomere. It has been recently discovered that this common path to immortality in multiple cancers is through two activating point mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp), found in more than 50 different cancer types, often at strikingly high frequencies, e.g. roughly 83% in glioblastomas (GBM) and 71% in melanomas. In the previous funding period, the PI has identified the molecular function of these highly recurrent mutations, demonstrating that the transcription factor (TF) GABP binds the mutant TERTp with exquisite specificity, but not the wild-type TERTp. The high prevalence of TERTp mutations across multiple cancer types and the selectivity of GABP recruitment to mutant TERTp thus provide an unprecedented opportunity for treating a large number of cancer patients with minimal toxicity to healthy cells. Despite the clear significance of this opportunity, however, several important questions surrounding the molecular functions and modulators of TERTp mutations remain poorly understood, hindering the development of effective and safe therapeutic strategies.  Our long-term goal is to establish a rigorous computational framework for understanding the aberrant transcriptional and epigenetic networks in cancers and to apply the resulting knowledge to devise novel therapeutic strategies that account for the genetic background of individual patients and that can a priori predict and avoid potential resistance mechanisms. The objective of our current renewal proposal is to develop powerful computational methods for transforming our knowledge about the non-coding TERTp mutations into an effective and safe molecular target. At the same time, the resulting methods will help resolve several outstanding challenges in the field of transcriptional gene regulation and have broad applications in cancer genomics. We will accomplish our objective my pursuing the following Aims: (1) Develop and test a computational framework for inferring sequence features that determine the distinct and shared binding patterns of paralogous TFs; (2) Develop and validate integrative tools for discovering the molecular basis of genetic interactions between germline variations and oncogenic mutations; (3) Develop and apply computational methods for studying the role of DNA helical phase between adjacent binding motifs in recruiting ETS factors to chromatin; (4) Perform a systematic genomic characterization of the effects of knocking out GABPB1L in TERTp-mutant cancer cells and healthy cells. The results of this proposal will have a broad impact on cancer research by providing powerful tools for studying paralogous oncogenic TFs and revealing novel insights into a highly promising therapeutic strategy. The proposed research will provide computational and bioinformatic resources for studying the binding pattern of paralogous oncogenic transcription factors. It will provide a computational framework for inferring the function of non-coding regulatory mutations and studying their interaction with common genetic variants. As an important application, we will systematically analyze a novel therapeutic strategy that has the potential to treat effectively a large number of patients across multiple cancer types harboring the recently discovered TERT promoter mutations.",Predicting Transcriptional and Epigenetic Networks in Cancer from Sequencing Data,10054960,R01CA163336,"['Address', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family member', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Role', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Specificity', 'TERT gene', 'Techniques', 'Telomerase', 'Telomere Maintenance', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'bioinformatics resource', 'c-myc Genes', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'computer framework', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'dimer', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'knowledge of results', 'melanoma', 'member', 'mutant', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'resistance mechanism', 'telomere', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,326483
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects. Systematic study of therapeutic and adverse drug responses using diverse experimental technologies and the latest data science and machine learning methods is essential for bringing about the next wave of precision cancer medicine.",Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs,10114985,U54CA225088,"['Achievement', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAF gene', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Logic', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Newsletter', 'Non-Malignant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Proteomics', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translating', 'acquired drug resistance', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical research site', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'effector T cell', 'imaging modality', 'immune checkpoint', 'improved', 'inhibiting antibody', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'mutant', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical', 'precision oncology', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'small molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U54,2021,2032638
"Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness In 2011, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality for participants screened with low-dose CT (LDCT) as opposed to chest X-ray. Based largely on these findings, LDCT lung screening is now a covered service for 8.7 million high-risk current and former smokers in the United States. For high-risk individuals younger than 65, insurance coverage is mandated under the Affordable Care Act; for those 65 and over screening is covered by Medicare. Medicare covers lung screening only if patients are enrolled in a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services-approved lung screening registry. The American College of Radiology Lung Cancer Screening Registry (ACR-LCSR) is the only registry currently approved by CMS. Although most medical societies have endorsed CT for lung cancer screening, the American Academy of Family Physicians concluded that the evidence was insufficient to recommend either for or against lung screening, as the results of the NLST had not been replicated in a community setting. Concerns regarding the dissemination of lung screening focus on 1) the high rate of false positive (FP) screens, for which participants receive a positive screening result and require additional testing, but do not have lung cancer, 2) the relatively high rate of potentially clinically important significant incidental findings (SIFs) detected at lung screening that are unrelated to lung cancer, and 3) potential harms from the diagnostic evaluation of these FP and SIF abnormalities. It is unclear whether the rate of FPs and SIFs seen in the NLST, will be replicated in community practice, as opposed to a clinical trial setting. Higher rates of FPs and SIFs in the community or inefficient diagnostic evaluation may result in delayed cancer diagnosis, excessive testing, iatrogenic complications due to unnecessary testing, or decreased cost-effectiveness of lung screening in the community, as opposed to the NLST. For the proposed research, we plan to: 1) compare the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer and the rate and type of SIFs in the ACR-LCSR community registry data as opposed to the NLST, 2) compare the diagnostic pathways used to assess these abnormalities in the community as opposed to the NLST, and 3) use a decision-tree cost-effectiveness analysis to compare community lung screening with NLST cost-effectiveness assumptions with respect to rates of lung and SIF abnormalities and diagnostic pathways; and to identify most cost-effective diagnostic pathways for each type of abnormality. This information is of vital importance to ensure that the reduction in lung cancer mortality reported by the NLST is achieved in the community setting. The goal of this project is to compare the efficacy of lung screening in community practice with that reported in the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) with respect to the rate and type of abnormalities suspicious for lung cancer, the rate and type of significant incidental findings that are seen on lung screening and may be clinically important, but that are not related to lung cancer, and the diagnostic testing that is done to evaluate lung and other abnormalities. We will use this information to compare the cost effectiveness of community lung screening with that estimated from the NLST and provide information that can be used to enhance the effectiveness of lung screening in the community.",Lung Screening: Efficacy versus Effectiveness,10165656,R01CA215240,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affordable Care Act', 'American', 'American College of Radiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diffusion', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Family Physicians', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Lung nodule', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Nodule', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Policy Maker', 'Preventive service', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'community setting', 'comparative cost effectiveness', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data registry', 'former smoker', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'participant enrollment', 'patient screening', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'tv watching']",NCI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,509518
"Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records Summary Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity in the United States, with more than half a million deaths estimated in 2019. Systemic cancer therapies are increasingly being designed as long-term oral anti-cancer medications, given the increased convenience of a self-administered regimen. For instance, patients with operable hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer are prescribed adjuvant oral hormonal therapy, with an expectation that they continue their regimen for a minimum of 5 years to maximize the benefits. Although many oral therapies have proven effective in mitigating cancer recurrence and mortality, discontinuation to these treatments are not uncommon. This is a concern because medication discontinuation before the completion of a prescribed treatment protocol leads to lower survival rates, increased risks of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs. To improve treatment adherence and promise better healthcare delivery, it is essential for healthcare providers to know when and why a cancer patient will discontinue their medications. While there have been various investigations into regimen discontinuation, the focus of these studies is either on knowledge discovery or intervention. While knowledge discovery focuses on characterizing the potential factors that lead to medication discontinuation, intervention aims to leverage discovered knowledge to design and test effective strategies to help patients adhere to treatments. Because there are thousands of cancer patients, it is impossible for healthcare providers to apply intervention to each of them. Limited medical resources need to be allocated efficiently, such that patients with a higher risk of discontinuing medications will receive greater, timely attention. Yet, the increasing integration of online communication and mobile computing technologies into the healthcare domain are generating massive quantities of patient-generated information. Thus, we propose to apply online patient-provider communications in a patient portal to supplement traditional EMR data to better understand a cancer patient’s medical experience. The central hypothesis of this project is that such communications together with structured EMRs can be applied to learn and forecast oral anti-cancer medication discontinuation. The specific aims of this project designed to test our central hypothesis are to 1) discover what has been communicated in a patient portal; 2) infer how patient portal messages and structured EMRs are associated with medication discontinuation; and 3) determine who are more likely to discontinue medications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply the messages in a patient portal and structured EMRs to investigate medication discontinuation for cancer patients. Project Narrative Many oral anti-cancer medications have proven effective in preventing cancer recurrence and mortality, however, treatment adherence to these oral medications, some of which are taken for years, can be challenging for cancer patients due to a variety of factors, including side effects and high costs. Since medication discontinuation can lead to lower survival rates, increased risk of recurrence, and higher healthcare costs, society will benefit from gaining a deeper understanding of the causes of medication discontinuation and knowing who are at a high risk of medication discontinuation. In this project, we will analyze the online communications between patients and healthcare providers in a patient portal and apply them as well as structured electronic medical records to predict medication discontinuation.",Prediction of Anti-Cancer Medication Discontinuation via Patient Portal Messages and Structured Electronic Medical Records,10151599,R37CA237452,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adjuvant', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Back', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Human Characteristics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Oncology', 'Oral', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling Biases', 'Self Administration', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Sociology', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Surveys', 'Survival Rate', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Work', 'anti-cancer', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer therapy', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'expectation', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'hormone receptor-positive', 'hormone therapy', 'human subject', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'patient engagement', 'patient portal', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'side effect', 'social cognitive theory', 'text searching', 'treatment adherence', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R37,2021,386906
"Clinical performance of hemodynamics-based non-invasive device for skin cancer testing Skin cancer is the most common form of cancer in the US, accounting for just under half of all diagnosed cancers (5+ million diagnoses), 27,000+ deaths each year and the annual treatment costs of over $8.1 billion. The early diagnosis of skin cancer has significant impact on patient outcomes and health care costs but remains highly subjective and requires highly specialized training while existing diagnostic devices offer low positive predictive value which results in both, missed skin cancers as well as a large number of unnecessary biopsies. When a patient presents with a suspicious skin lesion, uncertainty in the initial assessment by a dermatologist may lead to biopsies that suggest that no subsequent treatment is necessary (false positive - FP) while at the same time lesions that are not biopsied may warrant treatment (false negative - FN) potentially giving rise to claims of malpractice. FPs subject patients to unnecessary procedures and the health care system to unnecessary costs. FNs result in delayed treatment, compromising patient outcomes and increasing health care costs. This diagnostic problem is exacerbated when a patient first presents to a primary care practice due to lesser diagnostic performance. Here, some patients may be referred unnecessarily to dermatologists while other cases go undetected. The Veriskin’s TruScore device is a proprietary, non-invasive, low-cost, easy-to-use, hand-held unit that supports the diagnosis of skin cancer. It rapidly and objectively determines whether a suspicious skin lesion is cancerous, reducing the number of FNs and also reducing the need for unnecessary biopsies. The device provides a score of 0% to 100% indicating the probability of malignancy. The TruScore works by detecting and analyzing force-induced hemodynamic abnormalities due to pathological angiogenesis which is a well established early hallmark of cancer. Pilot clinical studies indicate >99% sensitivity and >94% specificity in differentiating of skin cancer from a variety of benign conditions. The device is useful at all levels of care, but the greatest benefits to patients may result when the device is used in primary care practice. The specific goal of this project is to test the device in a larger scale clinical study. The long-term goal of the project is to achieve widespread clinical adoption of this simple-to-use and low-cost non- invasive skin cancer diagnostic method and device that will (1) facilitate sensitive, specific and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin regions by general practice clinicians and nurse practitioners, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs. Project Narrative The lack of accurate, objective skin cancer assessment tool for frontline caregivers leads to preventable loss of lives and costs the US healthcare system over $8B each year.  VeriSkin device enables a low cost, non-invasive, easy-to-use skin cancer diagnostic method that will (1) facilitate accurate and non-subjective assessment of suspect skin lesions by general practice clinicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, (2) enable precise targeting of patients for biopsies and/or escalation of care resulting in reduction in both the number of missed skin cancers and the number of unneeded referrals to dermatologists and unnecessary biopsies, and (3) provide overall reduction in skin cancer treatment costs.  The requested funds will be used to demonstrate the safety and the effectiveness of the device in a larger clinical study needed to enable regulatory approval of the device.",Clinical performance of hemodynamics-based non-invasive device for skin cancer testing,10127607,R44CA250768,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Assessment tool', 'Basal Cell', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Blood flow', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Cutaneous', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Dermatologist', 'Detection', 'Device Approval', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Family Practice', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Practices', 'General Practitioners', 'Goals', 'Hand functions', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intercellular Fluid', 'Internal Medicine', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malpractice', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Morphology', 'Neoplasms', 'Nevus', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Optics', 'Painless', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Neovascularization', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physician Assistants', 'Pigments', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Screening for Skin Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Specialist', 'Specificity', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Cost', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Uncertainty', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Vascular resistance', 'Work', 'absorption', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanical pressure', 'melanoma', 'novel', 'peace', 'pressure', 'provider behavior', 'response', 'safety testing', 'screening', 'skills', 'skin lesion', 'tumor', 'vascular abnormality']",NCI,"VERISKIN, INC.",R44,2021,833460
"Development of a Novel Lung Function Imaging Modality for comprehensive management of lung cancer Our project proposes an academic-industrial partnership to translate a novel lung function imaging modality into clinical care for lung cancer patients receiving radiation therapy. Lung cancer patients being treated with radiation can experience serious and sometimes life threatening thoracic side effects from treatment. There is emerging data demonstrating that a novel lung function imaging modality can reduce side-effects and improve quality of life for lung cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. The novel lung function imaging modality, referred to as ‘4DCT-ventilation,’ uses 4DCT data along with image processing techniques to innovatively calculate lung ventilation maps. 4DCT-ventilation can improve outcomes for lung cancer patients by enabling the generation of functional avoidance radiotherapy plans. Functional avoidance uses 4DCT-ventilation to avoid functional portions of the lung, with the hypothesis that reducing dose to functional lung will reduce thoracic side- effects. Our 4DCT-ventilation research has progressed from retrospective studies to an early-phase trial using 4DCT-ventilation for functional avoidance radiotherapy. The early promising toxicity results from 4DCT- ventilation clinical trials is providing a strong rationale for national trials and expanded clinical integration across individual clinics. The problem is that expanded clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation is currently not possible due to a lack of consistent, efficient, and clinically validated methods. We propose an academic-industry partnership with MIM Software to address these challenges precluding clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation.  The purpose of our study is to develop methods that enable safe, efficient, and clinically validated methods for clinical integration of 4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance. Our overarching hypothesis is that the 4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance innovations we develop will be demonstrated to reduce lung toxicity in clinics with no prior 4DCT-ventilation experience. The project will be carried out in 3 aims. Aim 1 will develop methods that enable automated 4DCT-ventilation calculations including auto-segmentation, statistically-robust calculation methods, and clinically-efficient quality assurance tools. Aim 2 will develop methods for 4DCT- ventilation functional avoidance radiotherapy including image heterogeneity assessment, development of knowledge-based functional planning methods, and evaluation of metrics most critical in reducing toxicity. In conjunction with our industry partner, the developed methods from Aims 1 and 2 will be integrated in a commercial-grade software tool. Aim 3 will evaluate feasibility by assessing whether 4DCT-ventilation functional avoidance can be demonstrated to reduce toxicity in clinics with no prior 4DCT-ventilation experience.  Our project will generate both the tools and data needed to provide guidance on how to properly incorporate 4DCT-ventilation into clinical care. The methods and data will culminate in a commercial-grade platform suitable for busy clinics. 4DCT-ventilation has great potential to improve outcomes for lung cancer patients and our project will enable the integration of this novel imaging modality into clinical care.

"MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER Project Summary Head and neck cancer is the fifth most common cancer in the United States, with an overall survival rate of around 50%. Compared to other subsites of head and neck cancer, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is increasing and has been intimately linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Most oropharyngeal cancer patients receive standard therapy. However, clinical outcomes vary significantly and are difficult to predict. Thus, more robust prognostic biomarkers are needed to accurately stratify patients for the risk of treatment failures.  The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays and therapeutic agents for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that collectively control the expression of thousands of protein-coding genes. miRNAs are extensively involved in tumorigenesis and they have deregulated expression in human cancers. Recent studies indicate that miRNAs are promising biomarkers and play critical regulatory roles in many types of cancer. However, the prognostic and therapeutic values of miRNAs in oropharyngeal cancer are poorly characterized to date. Our preliminary analysis has identified six miRNAs that are predictive of oropharyngeal cancer outcome. Here, we propose to significantly expand our preliminary study to identify new miRNA biomarkers by analyzing all oropharynx-related miRNAs in a large number of oropharyngeal tumors. These miRNA biomarkers will then be combined to build a robust model for significantly improved prognosis of oropharyngeal cancer. Further, the therapeutic potential of selected prognostic miRNAs will be evaluated by characterizing the roles of these miRNAs in cancer progression and treatment response. RELEVANCE Although the overall incidence of head and neck cancer has decreased steadily in the past decades, the number of reported oropharyngeal cancer cases has increased significantly. The long-term goal of this research is to develop clinical prognostic assays for individualized oropharyngeal cancer treatment by focusing on microRNAs, which are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in tumorigenesis.",MICRORNA BIOMARKERS FOR OROPHARYNGEAL CANCER,10238766,R01DE026471,"['Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Data', 'Family', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Human', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Oncogenic', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Neoplasms', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Survival Rate', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Treatment Failure', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'high risk', 'improved', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'screening', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,378722
"GenePattern and GenePattern Notebook: Integrative 'Omic Analysis for Cancer Research Project Summary Over the past two decades, the landscape of cancer research has changed with the explosion of publicly available and investigator generated datasets from evolving technology platforms, and the growing number of sophisticated computational methods and tools to integrate and analyze them. To move the cancer research agenda forward, the cancer research community needs a way to easily combine the right tools and methods to analyze and visualize all the data relevant to their studies, and reproducibly capture the history of what they have done. These objectives may be especially daunting for cancer biologists who don’t program. The GenePattern computational genomics environment has served cancer investigators since 2004 and was enhanced by GenePattern Notebook, released in 2017. The goal of this proposal is to continue to support, expand, and enhance the GenePattern ecosystem. Through these efforts we will continue to support a diverse community of users at the forefront of cancer research who seek to better understand the underlying mechanisms of disease, translate improved methods for patient diagnosis and prognosis to the clinic, and identify new drug targets. Aim 1. Ensure the GenePattern ecosystem continues to keep pace with new and emerging methods and technologies and the changing cancer research environment. To increase the range of methods and approaches available to the GenePattern community, we will provide seamless access to other popular ‘omic analysis packages (Cytoscape, Galaxy, IGV) within GenePattern Notebook, allowing the interleaving of methods from multiple packages within the same executable notebook. We will also provide support for querying and accessing data hosted on selected cancer-relevant data repositories. Aim 2. Continue to author and serve GenePattern notebooks for the cancer research community. We will develop 30-50 new high utility notebooks for the GenePattern-Notebook Workspace, leveraging Aim 1 as required, that provide users with guided, step-by-step execution of their integrative analysis. These will comprise data processing and analysis workflows, including approaches that bridge the gap from discovery to translation. Aim 3. Extend, maintain, and support the GenePattern ecosystem infrastructure. We will continue to support and enhance the GenePattern ecosystem, including enabling hosting on multiple cloud architectures and high- performance compute sites, and enhancing the Notebook user interface with high-value features. Aim 4. Provide outreach, training, and support to our user community. We will engage the cancer research community to continue to address their needs. A Scientific Advisory Board of cancer biologists and physician scientists will review progress and guide our strategy as we proceed. We will continue our high level of support and outreach for GenePattern and its notebook environment, including cancer-focused tutorials and training materials, in-person workshops, conference presentations, webinars, and social media vehicles and our responsive forum. We will fully participate in all of the ITCR program activities.

"Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer Title: Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Proteomics Signatures of Cancer Abstract Cancer is a complex disease in which genetic disruptions in cell signaling networks are known to play a significant role. A major aim of cancer systems biology is to build models that can predict the impact of these genetic disruptions to guide therapeutic interventions (i.e. personalized medicine). A prominent driver of cancer cell growth is signaling pathway deregulation from mutations in key regulatory nodes and loss/gain in gene copy number (CNV). However, current mathematical modeling approaches do not adequately capture the impact of these genetic changes. Reasons for this include the poorly understood layers of regulation between gene expression and protein activity, and limitations in most modeling and protein measurement technologies. In addition, there is a paucity of overarching hypotheses that can link specific gene expression or mutation patterns to the cancer phenotype. Recent work by our group has resolved some of the technical challenges that have hindered the application of proteomics technologies to cancer systems biology research. It has also suggested a new approach for using quantitative proteomics data to understand mechanisms driving cancer cell behavior. Using an ultrasensitive, targeted proteomics platform that can measure both abundance and phosphorylation of proteins present at only hundreds of copies per cell, we found that signaling pathways appeared to be controlled by only a limited number of key nodes whose activity is tightly regulated through low abundance and feedback phosphorylation. We propose to build on these findings by critically testing the hypothesis that CNV and genetic mutations dysregulate signaling pathways in cancer by shifting control from tightly regulated nodes to poorly regulated ones. This will be done by systematically identifying key regulatory nodes of normal and cancer cells using CRISPRa/i screens, determine the relationship between protein abundance and signaling pathway activities using ultrasensitive targeted proteomics and phosphoproteomics and then use these data to semi-automatically generate mathematical models of the functional topology of the signaling pathways. Specifically, we propose to: 1) Use targeted CRISPR gene perturbation libraries to identify the regulatory topologies of signaling pathways important in cancer and how they are disrupted by common cancer mutations, 2) Use the CRISPR perturbation and proteomics data to semi-automatically build predictive models of cancer cell signaling pathways, and 3) Combine modeling and perturbation screens to understand how feedback regulation in cancer contributes to drug resistance. This work will result in simplified, computationally tractable yet mechanistic models of signaling pathways and provide network maps of feedback and crosstalk circuits that can be used to rapidly map the regulatory state of cells. Most important, it will provide a generic platform for translating protein abundance and phosphorylation patterns into a “state” snapshot of cancers that can lead to predicting their response to specific drugs. Narrative Cancer is an extremely complex disease which is frequently caused by signaling pathway deregulation from genetic mutation or loss/gain in gene copy number. Modern analytical techniques have provided a wealth of data on the molecular changes associated with cancer mutations, but it has been extremely difficult to use this information to design targeted therapies. We propose a new methodology that combines CRISPR-based targeted screens, advanced proteomics technologies, and a new mathematical modeling approach for identifying proteomics signatures of altered signaling pathways in cancer that can be used to build predictive models and explore mechanisms of drug resistance.",Reverse Sensitivity Analysis for Identifying Predictive Proteomics Signatures of Cancer,10148720,U01CA227544,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Breast Cancer cell line', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'CRISPR library', 'Cancer Cell Growth', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Feedback', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Dosage', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Play', 'Predictive Cancer Model', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Translating', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer type', 'cell behavior', 'design', 'experimental study', 'mathematical model', 'melanoma', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'phosphoproteomics', 'predictive modeling', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'screening', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NCI,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U01,2021,597684
"Identifying Metabolic Vulnerabilities in Lung Cancer OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY IDENTIFYING METABOLIC VULNERABILITIES IN LUNG CANCER Lung Cancer is the most common cause of cancer deaths world-wide. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy have been shown to be effective in a subset of patients; however, the overall survival rate for this disease remains low especially for metastatic disease. Moreover, small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients have a poor prognosis, and there especially exists a gap in knowledge in understanding SCLC and identifying effective therapeutic strategies. Our goal in this proposal is to understand the underlying biology of key drivers in lung cancer by identifying metabolic vulnerabilities that can ultimately be used as single agents or combined with immunotherapy to target lung cancer therapeutically. We will achieve this goal by engaging experts that have developed preclinical models with common molecular signatures in non-small cell (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and cutting-edge metabolomics. We have an active and collaborative group that meets twice monthly with projects and manuscripts that are co-authored by the leaders of each project and core. Additionally, our Program Project Grant (PPG) team is located at Moffitt Cancer Center, which is an ideal place to study the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Florida is number 2 in the country in terms of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients. Moffitt treats 10% of these cases. The PPG consists of four projects and four cores. These projects and cores collaborate and synergize to meet four objectives: i. To identify metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancers through integrative analysis of in vivo and ex vivo models with common molecular signatures, including p53, NRF2/KEAP1, and MYC (Project #1, led by Dr. Flores, Project #2, led by Dr. DeNicola, Project #3, led by Drs. Cleveland and Haura, and Project #4, led by Dr. Rodriguez with support from the Administrative Core #1, led by Drs. Flores and Haura, Preclinical Models and Pathology Core #2, led by Drs. Cress and Karreth, Metabolism Core #3, led by Dr. Koomen, and Data Science Core #4, led by Dr. Fridley), ii. To identify metabolic vulnerabilities that synergize with immunotherapy through examining the tumor microenvironment and gaining a deep molecular understanding of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). (Project #4 in collaboration with Projects #1 and #2 and Core #2), iii. To build mouse models as a platform to understand the metabolic pathways utilized by lung cancers with different genetic signatures and to assess therapeutic strategies for lung cancer. (Core #2 supporting Projects #1-4), and iv. To share resources and data locally and globally to obtain an integrated molecular understanding of metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancer. (Core #4 leading efforts from All Projects and Cores). OVERALL PROJECT NARRATIVE IDENTIFYING METABOLIC VULNERABILITIES IN LUNG CANCER Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, and common therapy for both NSCLC and SCLC includes surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy. Many of the driver genes mutated in lung cancer are transcription factors and are difficult to target therapeutically and have been dubbed “undruggable”. Our goal in this application is to develop a deep molecular understanding of the metabolic pathways regulated by key drivers in lung cancer using sophisticated and novel mouse models of lung cancer, patient derived samples and organoids, and state-of-the-art approaches in the analysis of metabolites to identify metabolic vulnerabilities in lung cancer as potential therapeutic targets.",Identifying Metabolic Vulnerabilities in Lung Cancer,10171098,P01CA250984,"['Address', 'Biology', 'Brassicaceae', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Cysteine', 'Cysteine Metabolism Pathway', 'Data', 'Data Science Core', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug resistance', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Florida', 'Genes', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunotherapy', 'Knowledge', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuscripts', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutate', 'Myeloid-derived suppressor cells', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organoids', 'PERK kinase', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Radiation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate', 'TP53 gene', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor', 'chemotherapy', 'data repository', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'experimental study', 'genetic signature', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung small cell carcinoma', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'therapeutically effective', 'transcription factor', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,H.

"Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ABSTRACT - Overall The overall goal of the Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity Center in the Cancer Systems Biol- ogy Consortium (M2CH-CSBC Center) is to improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by developing systems level strategies to prevent the emergence of cancer subpopulations that are resistant to treatment. We postulate that heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and di- verse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside are root causes of resistance. We will learn how intrinsic and extrinsic factors influence differentiation state, proliferation and therapeutic re- sponse in TNBC through experimental manipulation and computational modeling of cancer cell lines, 3D engi- neered multicellular systems, xenografts and clinical specimens. We will deploy single cell `omic and imaging technologies that allow quantitative assessment of molecular, cellular, and structural heterogeneity. We will interpret these data using computational models that define control networks and structures in heterogeneous systems as well as transitions between states of therapeutic resistance and sensitivity. This will be accom- plished in three related Projects and three Cores. Project 1 will focus on measuring and managing resistance- associated heterogeneity intrinsic to cancer cells. Project 2 will focus on identifying resistance-associated sig- nals from the microenvironment and on mitigating effects from these signals on therapeutic response. Project 3 will apply spatial systems biology approaches to TNBC specimens and multicell type models thereof to dis- cover molecular control networks that influence how cell intrinsic plasticity and microenvironment signaling al- ter therapeutic responses in complex tissues. All three Projects will include analysis of 5 core cell lines (HCC1143, HCC1599, MDA-MB-468, SUM149PT, and HCC1806), 5 patient derived cultures, and 6 FDA ap- proved, pathway-targeted drugs (afatinib, ruxolotinib, trametinib, BYL719, cabozantinib, and everolimus). The computational network discovery, data integration, spatial systems analysis and modeling approaches are the same in all Projects and serve to integrate the work of the overall M2CH-CSBC Center. Multiple integrative computational strategies are proposed to identify candidate heterogeneity control networks. These include analysis of existing genomic, epigenomic, pharmacologic response, and metabolomic characteristics of prima- ry tumors and models thereof. An Imaging Management and Analysis Core will provide infrastructure and image analytics that will enable efficient image data management, quantitative analysis of image features, and visualization of images and metadata generated using multiscale light and electron microscopy. An Outreach Core will make educational materials, experimental and computational tools and data available to the CSB Consortium, to the CSBC/PS-ON Coordinating Center and to the broader scientific community. An Administrative Core serves as the organization, integration, and evaluation hub of the M2CH-CSBC Center. Project narrative This Project will improve management of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) by understanding and managing heterogeneity arising from epigenomic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and from diverse signals from extrinsic microenvironments in which cancer cells reside.","Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity",10166783,U54CA209988,"['3-Dimensional', 'Breast Cancer Cell', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clonal Expansion', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Drug Targeting', 'Educational Materials', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'In Vitro', 'Infrastructure', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MDA-MB-468', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Procedures', 'Proteins', 'Reagent', 'Resistance', 'SDZ RAD', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'analytical tool', 'bioimaging', 'bioprinting', 'cancer cell', 'combinatorial', 'computational suite', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data management', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'light microscopy', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'novel', 'open source', 'outreach', 'prevent', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,U54,2021,1851265
"Proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discovery in hepatocellular carcinoma Project Summary  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and therapeutic options are limited. There is a pressing need to fully understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease in order to identify new effective biomarkers, drug targets, and therapeutic agents for the prognosis and treatment of HCC. Proteins are the functional molecules of the cell, and many clinically validated biomarkers and most drug targets are proteins; however, cancer omics studies have relied primarily on genomic platforms. By melding genomics with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, the new field of proteogenomics provides an opportunity to more completely understand how somatic genomes activate aberrant protein networks that drive cancer pathogenesis. A major National Cancer Institute (NCI)-funded initiative, the Clinical Proteomics Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC), and the more recently established International Cancer Proteogenome Consortium (ICPC), are promoting an integrated proteogenomics approach that is postulated to produce sounder therapeutic hypotheses and a new generation of protein biomarkers. The central purpose of this application is to forge a collaboration between a CPTAC team in the US and an ICPC team in China to enable proteogenomics-driven therapeutic discoveries in hepatitis B virus-related (HBV+) HCC, which attributes to 85% of HCC cases in China. The two teams bring complementary expertise required for a successful proteogenomic study of HCC. The China team has already generated the most comprehensive multi-omics dataset yet produced for liver cancer by applying proteogenomic profiling to a Chinese HBV+ HCC cohort (CHCC-HBV) with 159 cases, and the data has been preliminarily analyzed through collaborative efforts between the two teams. In this application, the US team will perform deep computational analyses of the proteogenomics data to generate prognostic models and therapeutic hypotheses, which will be experimentally validated in cell lines, animal models, and clinical specimens by the China team. Our specific Aims are: Aim 1) To develop and validate a protein-based prognostic model; Aim 2) To identify and validate subtype-specific causal drivers and therapeutic strategies; and Aim 3) To characterize the immune landscape of HBV+ HCC. Successful completion of this project will lead to new knowledge on HCC biology as well as new prognostic and treatment strategies for HBV+ HCC. Meanwhile, experimentally validated computational methods developed in this project will have wide application to the study of other cancers and other non-cancer diseases.

"Exploiting convergent evolution to design biomarker extraction tools for the prediction of therapeutic response in cancer PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The effective treatment of drug resistant tumors represents one of the greatest unmet needs in oncology research. The evolution of therapeutic resistance in cancer is a dynamic process, shaped by many external forces, including selection pressures, microenvironment, and the timescales of clinical treatments. As tumors evolve under these heterogeneous settings, a variety of genotypes emerge and lead to large differences in drug response phenotypes between patients. By grouping tumors based on their response to treatment, we can exploit principles of convergent evolution, where similar phenotypes evolve independently between individuals. In doing so, this work aims to aid precision medicine by identifying commonalities between tumors with similar drug response phenotypes.  Gene expression signatures are a powerful tool that can be used to predict convergent states of drug sensitiv- ity and resistance. Using vast open-source datasets, Aim 1 of this proposal will demonstrate a novel method for extracting and validating gene expression signatures to predict therapeutic response in cancer. Cell lines with the best and worst response to a given drug are pooled and compared using differential gene expression analysis. Genes with increased expression in a state of sensitivity or resistance become seed genes in a co-expression network based on gene expression from tumor samples. From there, only seed genes with strong co-expression within patient samples are extracted to form the ﬁnal gene expression signature. This novel approach integrates clinical sample data to the signature extraction method in order to increase translational value compared to molec- ular signatures extracted using only cell line datasets. Next, Aim 2 of this proposal investigates the phenomenon of collateral sensitivity, where resistance to one drug aligns with sensitivity to another drug. Because the evo- lution of collateral resistance and sensitivity can be unpredictable, molecular signatures of convergent states of collateral sensitivity and resistance could greatly enhance treatment planning once resistance to ﬁrst-line ther- apy has evolved. Using EGFR+ non-small cell lung cancer cell lines as a model system, this project aims to identify molecular signatures of evolutionarily convergent collateral sensitivity/resistance phenotypes during the experimental evolution of therapeutic resistance to targeted therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Tumor differences between patients can hinder the prediction of therapeutic response in cancer, as patients with seemingly similar tumors often display varying levels of chemo-sensitivity or -resistance. This work aims to abandon the “one-drug-ﬁts-all” approach and produce a novel method for discovering biomarkers of therapeutic sensitivity and resistance in cancer. Our results will assist clinicians in choosing the best available treatment for each individual patient.",Exploiting convergent evolution to design biomarker extraction tools for the prediction of therapeutic response in cancer,10138410,F30CA257076,"['Ally', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Chronic Myeloid Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug resistance', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Evolution', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Grouping', 'Imatinib', 'Individual', 'Inter-tumoral heterogeneity', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Work', 'base', 'bcr-abl Fusion Proteins', 'cancer cell', 'cancer gene expression', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'design', 'differential expression', 'drug sensitivity', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'gene product', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Evaluating Etiological Impact of Metatranscriptomic and Immunological Features for Lung Cancer ABSTRACT There is increasing evidence that the evolution of cancer is strongly dependent on the complex tumor microenvironment (TME) in which it develops. Despite the important roles of both microbiota and immune cells within TME, there are huge gaps in linking specific lung-residing microbiota changes with immune cell subpopulations. To date, no human lung cancer studies have been performed to characterize the host-pathogen dynamic changes and dissecting the microbiome-immune interaction in an integrated manner. We hypothesize that the dysbiosis of lung-residing microbe (microbiota expression changes) triggers dysregulated balance in the lung immune system (immune cells infiltration levels), which results in an inflammatory TME, and further promotes lung tumorigenesis and tumor progression. We propose to capitalize on existing RNA-Seq (tumor and adjacent tissue) from 200 early-stage (I–IIIA) lung adenocarcinoma patients, from a Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) study (discovery, n = 100) and a Harvard School of Public Health study (external validation, n = 100), with no cost to this application. Our goal is to reveal the impact of the lung microbiota on host immune cell profiles and how their interaction contributes to tumorigenesis and tumor progression. To accomplish our goals, we will utilize a Dual RNA-Seq analytical approach: 1) to identity intratumoral metatranscriptomic signatures, and 2) to characterize immune infiltration profiles and microbiome- immune interaction. Specifically, the unmapped quality-filtered RNA reads (non-human, putative microbial reads) aligned to microbial reference transcriptomes will be used for metatranscriptome analysis (Aim 1); whereas reads that map to human reference will be used for computational immune profiling analysis (Aim 2). This is the first study to simultaneously profile lung tissue-specific microbiota expression and immune infiltrates in lung adenocarcinoma. This project could contribute significantly to our understanding of the biological processes before/during (adjacent/tumor tissue) lung adenocarcinoma development, in particular the complex microbiome-immune interaction. Elucidating the nature of interactions between lung microbiome and immune cells comprising the TME could guide the development of novel therapeutic interventions. Public Health Relevance With the advent of low-dose computed tomography screening, more early-stage lung cancers are being diagnosed and there is a need to understand the biology of the disease better. The goal of this project is to reveal the impact of the lung microbiota on host immune cell profiles and how their interaction contributes to tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Clinically, our findings may benefit the identification of lung cancer patients at high risk of tumor recurrence after surgery and could potentially support the selection of subgroups of patients for future personalized cancer therapies (such as immunotherapy).",Evaluating Etiological Impact of Metatranscriptomic and Immunological Features for Lung Cancer,10290463,R03CA262911,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Future', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammatory', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Public Health Schools', 'RNA', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Smoking', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'T memory cell', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-associated macrophages', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Validation', 'base', 'college', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'design', 'differential expression', 'dysbiosis', 'epidemiologic data', 'high risk', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung microbiome', 'lung microbiota', 'lung tumorigenesis', 'metatranscriptome', 'metatranscriptomics', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic microbe', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'public health relevance', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R03,2021,80000
"Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach Project Summary/Abstract This proposal will generate evidence to reduce the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the United States. Overdiagnosis is the identification of a disease that, had it not been detected, would be unlikely to cause symptoms or death during a patient’s lifetime. Overdiagnosis has significant consequences, such as overtreatment with associated side effects and complications, patient anxiety, and increased healthcare costs. Despite a three-fold increase in thyroid cancer diagnoses since the late 1980s, the mortality rate remains stable. Small papillary thyroid cancers, which are rarely lethal, are responsible for virtually the entire increase in incidence. However, it is not safe to assume that all small thyroid cancers are overdiagnosed; some small thyroid cancers can be aggressive and do need treatment. Effective methods are urgently needed to understand the key factors contributing to thyroid cancer overdiagnosis, so that directed solutions can be developed and implemented to reduce overdiagnosis. We propose the innovative use of systems engineering and simulation modeling to address this knowledge gap and provide a nuanced understanding of the natural history of thyroid tumors. We will use our model to identify the effect of reducing referrals for and use of thyroid imaging on overdiagnosis; the effect of changing the size threshold for biopsy on overdiagnosis; and the downstream impact of reducing overdiagnosis on harms and benefits of treatment. This approach also accounts for differential use and improved precision of ultrasound over time. Our goal is to create and validate a simulation model that quantifies overdiagnosis in thyroid cancer. We will engage stakeholders at all stages of development, from model conception to validation, to elicit clinical guidance and inform our model inputs, outcomes, and dissemination strategies. Our research team comprises an industrial-systems engineer with expertise in cancer modeling, as well as experts in thyroid cancer, cancer epidemiology, health services research, and communication. The multidisciplinary team is highly qualified to complete the three specific aims: (1) Develop and validate a simulation model to quantify overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer in the US; (2) Identify healthcare utilization patterns (e.g., provider encounters and referral decisions) that expose patients to increased thyroid imaging, biopsies, and the overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer; (3) Engage key stakeholders throughout the duration of the project to ensure that the model has face validity, and that the output can be applied to questions important to both clinicians and policy makers. The proposed research aligns with the National Cancer Institute’s mission to help people live longer and healthier lives. Results from this innovative model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care, while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) Overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer is a significant problem that compromises patients’ quality of life, leading to overtreatment, exposure to unnecessary risk, and high medical costs. The objective of this research is to identify factors that predispose people to being diagnosed with thyroid cancer that would never cause symptoms or death if undetected, so the healthcare system can instead focus resources on thyroid cancers that would result in morbidity if untreated. Results of the model will help to inform clinical practice guidelines and referral practice recommendations to improve the quality of health care while reducing inappropriate testing, to minimize overdiagnosis and overtreatment.",Estimating and Mitigating Thyroid Cancer Overdiagnosis: A Mathematical Modeling Approach,10239049,R01CA251566,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Breast', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Model', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal', 'Communication', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Industrialization', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of thyroid', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Natural History', 'Nodule', 'Non-Malignant', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Papillary thyroid carcinoma', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policy Maker', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thyroid Gland', 'Time', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Withholding Treatment', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer site', 'clinically relevant', 'dissemination strategy', 'follow-up', 'health care quality', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'public health relevance', 'sex', 'side effect', 'thyroid neoplasm', 'tumor growth', 'unethical', 'virtual', 'virtual laboratory']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,517978
"THE CANCER EPITOPE DATABASE AND ANALYSIS RESOURCE ABSTRACT Recent years have witnessed a dramatic rise in interest towards cancer epitopes in general, and neoepitopes that encompass mutations arising in a given tumor in particular. Current lines of research examine how the epitope load in a given tumor relates to the success of checkpoint blockade treatments, and how to utilize epitope-based vaccines and adoptive transfer of epitope-specific T cells for personalized therapies. For these purposes, neoepitopes that are recurrently recognized in different individuals are of particular interest, which has also re-ignited interest in epitopes identified in classic tumor-associated antigens. Along with the interest in cancer epitopes, there is also interest in the TCRs and BCRs specifically recognizing them, as these have the potential to be used in therapeutic approaches, and they can aid in basic studies to infer the specificity of T cells or B cells characterized in single cell sequencing data. This resurgence of interest in epitopes has created a need to catalog and make accessible to the scientific community all epitope data, also linked to the biological, immunological, and clinical contexts. The ultimate goal is to come “full circle” and link epitope recognition and immunological readouts to clinical outcomes and treatment strategies alike. In parallel, there is an urgent need to develop resources for epitope prediction and analysis tools that provide access to predictive strategies and provide objective evaluations of their performance in the relevant biological, immunological, and clinical contexts. Recent years have also witnessed the publication of multiple original methodologies that reported sometimes impressive gains in the predictions of cancer epitopes. However, several of these studies were difficult to evaluate, because the methodologies and/or datasets were not fully available in a format that was readily executable. As a result, their performance could not be properly benchmarked on independent datasets. This is also because effective benchmarking on independent datasets requires the assembly of novel datasets of sufficient size and diversity. To overcome all of these information technology challenges, we propose to design and implement the Cancer Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (CEDAR), which will provide a freely accessible, comprehensive collection of cancer epitope and receptor data curated from the literature, and provide easily accessible epitope and TCR/BCR target prediction and analysis tools. As the cancer epitope data are curated, they will be used as a transparent benchmark of how well prediction tools perform, and also to develop new prediction tools for the analysis resource component of CEDAR. CEDAR will leverage our expertise from developing the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB), which is fully operational and widely used by researchers globally. CEDAR will directly complement other projects currently funded through the NIH ITCR program that provide resources and tools related to cancer omics data. Finally, we will engage in outreach activities to improve functions, user interfaces, and interoperability with other ITCR tools and promote the use of CEDAR in cancer research. NARRATIVE Progress in the use of epitopes for cancer immunology and immunotherapy is hampered by a disconnect in information technology, which segregates investigators from the data and tools needed to appropriately conduct their research. Development of a Cancer Epitope Database and Analysis Resource will overcome this issue by harmonizing and centralizing the capture of cancer epitope data, and by using these data to establish and evaluate epitope analysis and prediction tools that will be made freely available to the research community.",THE CANCER EPITOPE DATABASE AND ANALYSIS RESOURCE,10187436,U24CA248138,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoptive Transfer', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Attention', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Histology', 'Catalogs', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Outcome', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Intuition', 'Journals', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Receptor Cell', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Study models', 'T-Cell Immunologic Specificity', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Transplantation', 'Tumor Antigens', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'clinical phenotype', 'cost effective', 'data tools', 'database structure', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immunogenicity', 'improved functioning', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'neoantigens', 'novel', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'receptor', 'single cell sequencing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational cancer research', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'web site', 'web-accessible']",NCI,LA JOLLA INSTITUTE FOR IMMUNOLOGY,U24,2021,839852
"Comprehensive characterization of the cancer microbiome and its immuno-oncology interface Project Summary/Abstract  Cancer has long been described as a disease of the human genome, and the past two decades of research have largely focused on characterizing the molecular mechanisms that contribute to its origin, progression, and treatment resistance.1,2,28–30 Over the past year, a series of seminal studies have identified significant non-human, microbial contributions in the development and advancement of solid tumors, hematologic malignancies, and germline cancer syndromes, as well as the variable efficacy of chemo- and immunotherapy, shedding light on what may be considered cancer’s ‘second’ genome (the metagenome).3–11,25 The extent of these microbial contributions across diverse cancer types in the human body and their implications on broader clinical management, however, remain largely unknown.12 Answering basic questions regarding the presence and specificity of such microbes in certain cancer types and cancer stages could guide the rational design of new, microbially-based diagnostics, prognostics, and therapies. Further, addressing more complex questions regarding the interactions of these microbes with cancer and host immune cells in the tumor microenvironment could provide critical insight into the design of personalized immunotherapy, cancer vaccines, and cancer risk profiles, hopefully leading to improved patient outcomes.  This proposal builds on a recent analysis of the cancer microbiome in 14,038 primary tumors, through which I have shown that virtually every major tumor type in the human body carries a unique, discriminative microbial signature. Inspired by recent evidence that highlights the role of pathogen-centric immunobiology in cancer development16,17 and the ability of microbes to powerfully modulate the systemic and local immune systems,5,6,8,18 I now hypothesize that the broad existence of these cancer microbes provides an evolutionary advantage for tumors to escape the host immune system’s recognition and response. I also hypothesize that the same immunological processes that are known to shape cancer’s mutational and phenotypic landscapes are concurrently shaping the tumor microbiota. Armed with patient germline HLA allele data and inferred immune cell abundances in the same primary tumors as those in our cancer microbiome study, I believe these hypotheses are finally testable. Aim 1 of this project seeks to investigate them alongside immunotherapy response data.21,22 Complementarily, Aim 2 seeks to define the intratumoral spatial distribution of the cancer microbiome and associated immune cells using a combination of computational and wet lab analyses. These results will contribute to our foundational knowledge on what is becoming the immuno-oncology-microbiome (IOM) axis.  The proposed interdisciplinary research will take place at UC San Diego in collaboration with microbiome, systems biology, tumor immunology, pathology, and oncology experts, who serve as mentors and advisors to me. Through their invaluable mentorship, hands-on learning, networking, and additional graduate coursework, I will grow into the translational and effective physician-scientist I so desire to be. Project Narrative The long-held view that cancer is a “sterile” entity is starting to change. New evidence suggests that intratumoral microbes can affect the development, progression, and treatment resistance of solid tumors. My preliminary findings suggest that unique microbial signatures exist for every major tumor type in the human body, and this proposal extends that work to characterize the interfaces between these cancer microbes, cancer cells, and the host immune system.",Comprehensive characterization of the cancer microbiome and its immuno-oncology interface,10112096,F30CA243480,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Alleles', 'Binding', 'Cancer Vaccines', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future Generations', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunobiology', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunologics', 'Immunooncology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Oxygen', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Predisposition', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Seminal', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Sterility', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cancer cell', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'carcinogenesis', 'design', 'digital', 'enteric infection', 'genome sequencing', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'hands-on learning', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning network', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'pathogen', 'personalized immunotherapy', 'prognostic', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor microbiota', 'tumor microenvironment', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F30,2021,38109
"Mouse Models of Human Cancer Database PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The laboratory mouse is the preeminent animal model system for investigation into the biology and genetics of human cancer. Mouse models have provided key insights into cancer susceptibility, the molecular genetics of tumor suppressor and oncogenes, and therapy response in pre-clinical and co-clinical studies. Human tumors engrafted into immune compromised and humanized mice (aka, Patient Derived Xenografts) are playing an increasingly important role as a powerful preclinical platform for testing new cancer treatments. The Mouse Models of Human Cancer (MMHC) database is a unique on-line compendium of mouse models for human cancer. MMHCdb provides electronic access to expertly curated and harmonized information on diverse mouse models for human cancer along with tools for accessing and visualizing associated data from these models. This in turn, facilitates the selection of appropriate strains of mice for cancer genetics research. MMHCdb integrates data derived from peer-reviewed literature and from direct submissions from researchers. Data in MMHCdb are also obtained from other bioinformatics resources including PathBase, HUGO Human Gene Nomenclature database, the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), and ArrayExpress. In this proposal we describe our plans for the continued development of MMHCdb with an emphasis on expanded support for analysis of tumor genomic data and drug response data from Patient Derived Xenograft models. To accomplish these goals we will build on successful collaborations to develop data standards for PDX models that are now widely adopted. The major goals for the project renewal include the following: · continue to populate MMHCdb with data on strain-specific patterns of tumorigenesis in inbred, mutant, and  genetically engineered mice, · leverage collaborations with Seven Bridges and PDXNet to analyze genomic data for PDX models using a  common analysis pipeline, · develop a platform for the analysis of PDX genomic and drug response data, and · support the infrastructure of MMHCdb and our user community through ongoing database maintenance,  development of new software components, user support services, and community outreach activities. PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The laboratory mouse is an important model system for investigating the genetics and biological principles of cancer and as a preclinical platform for testing new therapeutic approaches to treating cancer in humans.

"Advancing skin cancer prevention by tackling UV-induced clonogenic mutations 1 Squamous cell skin cancer (SCC) is the second most common cancer in the US. There are methods available  2 to prevent SCC but are not appropriately used because we lack methods of evaluating their effectiveness in a  3 timely manner. Ultraviolet light (UV) from the sun induces genomic damage which is the most important cause  4 of skin cancer. Early in the process of cancer formation UV causes mutations in cells which result in small  5 clones, clusters of mutated cells. The early mutations that result in the growth of these clones are called  6 clonogenic mutations (CM). CMs are early changes during SCC formation, which appear decades before  7 clinically detectable cancer. Based on previous evidence CMs may signal skin cancer risk and evaluate the  8 efficacy of preventative treatment strategies and sun protection. CM are in low abundance in the skin which 9 make them challenging to detect. However, recent advances in genomic sequencing technology and 10 computational tools allow accurate identification and quantitation of CMs in the skin. Preliminary data has shown 11 that CMS can be accurately detected and used to evaluate sun damaged skin areas. Many of the CMs found in 12 normal sun exposed skin are also common in SCC. The central hypothesis for this application is that CMs are 13 biomarkers of sun induced skin damaged and that CMs can measure how well strategies for skin cancer 14 prevention and preventative treatment work. In the first set of studies we will refine the previously developed 15 panel of sun induced CMs by identifying the most common CMs in sun exposed versus non-sun exposed skin. 16 Subsequent studies will examine the impact of UV exposure on changes in the CM panel and development of 17 skin cancer. These studies will evaluate patterns of CMs and the risk of developing skin cancer. Next, the 18 refined panel of CMs will be used to examine how well treatments designed to prevent skin cancer in heavily 19 sun damaged skin areas reduce CMs and skin cancer formation. In the final set of studies, CMs will be used to 20 evaluate the efficacy of sun protection strategies, such as sunscreens. Sun protection factor (SPF) is widely 21 used to evaluate sunscreens. However, SPF measures reduction in redness of the skin instead of the actual 22 DNA damage. Genomic DNA damage contributes to skin cancer, not “redness” in the skin. Genomic damage 23 can be caused by long term sun damage that does not cause a sunburn. In the final set of studies, CMs are used 24 to evaluate the effectiveness of sunscreens to protect against genomic damage and skin cancer. These studies 25 will change how we evaluate a patient’s risk of developing skin cancer and how we determine the effect of skin 26 cancer prevention. These studies have the potential to shift the focus from treating cancer to preventing the 27 occurrence of skin cancer. This would result in an improvement in cancer care outcomes, improve treatment 28 strategies and ultimately improve the life of individual with a history of sun damage and pre-cancerous lesions. 29 This work focuses on skin cancer but as CMs play a crucial first step in cancer growth in most human cancers 30 our findings and the framework of this study will have implications for the wider field of preventative oncology. UV-induced clonogenic mutations (CMs) can be used to evaluate an individual's overall sun exposure and the status of sun-induced genotoxicity in the skin which can profoundly impact how we diagnosis and treat early stage skin cancer. CMS can be used to evaluate therapeutic response to field treatments for skin cancer. CMS can be used to rapidly evaluate strategies for the prevention of skin cancer, such as the genoprotective efficacy of sunscreens or an individual's adherence to sunscreen application.",Advancing skin cancer prevention by tackling UV-induced clonogenic mutations,10097574,R01CA255242,"['Adherence', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidermis', 'Erythema', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'NOTCH1 gene', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive measure', 'Preventive treatment', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Redness', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Skin Cancer', 'Skin Squamous Cell', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Sun Exposure', 'Sun protection factor', 'Sunburn', 'Sunscreening Agents', 'TP53 gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Sun', 'Time', 'Training', 'UV Radiation Exposure', 'UV carcinogenesis', 'UV induced', 'UV protection', 'UV sensitive', 'UVB induced', 'Ultraviolet B Radiation', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Validation', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cancer care', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'care outcomes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'dosage', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy evaluation', 'genetic variant', 'genotoxicity', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mouse model', 'photoprotection', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive panel', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'research clinical testing', 'skin cancer prevention', 'skin damage', 'skin squamous cell carcinoma', 'standard of care', 'sun damage', 'sun protection', 'targeted sequencing', 'therapy design', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NCI,ROSWELL PARK CANCER INSTITUTE CORP,R01,2021,596193
"Macro-vasculature: A Novel Image Biomarker of Lung Cance ABSTRACT  Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States and worldwide. The high mortality associated with lung cancer is in part due to underutilization of and limited access to lung cancer screening that impedes early diagnosis. The apprehension of some clinicians and policymakers towards lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) exams is based on concerns of lead-time bias and high false-positive rate. The development of a robust lung cancer biomarker that reduces screen-detected false positives and improves classification of indeterminate nodules would relieve some of the concerns related to lung cancer screening. Although investigations show that screening with LDCT scans may reduce lung cancer mortality by 20% compared to chest x-ray, it is reported that ~96% of suspicious findings (mostly indeterminate nodules) turn out to be non-cancerous (false positives). Clinical management of screen-detected indeterminate nodules often leads to unnecessary, costly, and potentially harmful follow-up procedures (e.g., follow-up CT scan, positron emission tomography (PET)/CT exam, invasive biopsies). We have developed an exciting and novel image-based macro-vasculature feature to discriminate benign from malignant nodules. We propose to further develop the feature and validate it across a range of CT protocols and scans from other institutions. We will also integrate the macro-vasculature features with clinical information (e.g., age, gender, smoking history, lung function) and evaluate the model's ability to discriminate benign from malignant screen-detected indeterminate nodules. We will investigate if a radiologist's classification of indeterminate nodules improves with the output of the integrative model compared to classification without the integrative model. The success of this project may lead to a novel and robust lung cancer biomarker to accurately assess screen-detected indeterminate nodules that can significantly reduce the number of unnecessary follow-up procedures during lung cancer screening. Project Narrative: We propose to investigate the role of the macro-vasculature surrounding indeterminate lung nodules depicted on CT images to discriminate screen-detected benign and malignant nodules. The goal is to improve lung cancer screening by reducing the number of unnecessary procedure associate the high rate of false positive detections.",Macro-vasculature: A Novel Image Biomarker of Lung Cance,10084850,R01CA237277,"['Administrator', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Colon', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Nodule', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking History', 'Spiculate', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'chest computed tomography', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'demographics', 'density', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'longitudinal database', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pulmonary function', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor growth']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,411709
"Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer ABSTRACT Colon cancer (CC) is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous disease. While the TCGA data has implicated numerous molecular aberrations in cancer etiology and mechanisms, a direct link between genomic events and patient outcomes is lacking. While the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) staging system is widely utilized and provides prognostic information, CCs show considerable stage-independent variability in outcome indicating that more robust classifiers are needed for prognostic stratification. Prognostic information is critical to guide patient management and surveillance after cancer resection and can inform treatment selection. Using only gene expression data, we identified four consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of CC with distinct prognoses. We hypothesize that inclusion of additional genomic features will enable more granular molecular subtyping by identifying additional molecular patterns. Toward this objective (Aim 1), we will utilize multi-omics data sets generated from two completed phase III adjuvant chemotherapy trials in CC (NCCTG N0147, NSAPB C-08). We will also develop a supervised prognostic model by integrating comprehensive molecular data with clinicopathological variables and outcome data (Aim 2). Our unique resource for supervised learning is the high-quality survival data from the clinical trial cohorts. We hypothesize that integration of genomic alterations within clinically relevant genes and gene expression levels with clinicopathological variables can improve the prediction of recurrence/survival compared to traditional TNM staging alone. We will include in a step-wise fashion in our training models selected genes and miRNA expression, somatic mutations, minor allele frequencies, somatic copy number alterations as well as CMS and clinical features, to optimize predictive performance. Given that immune and stromal infiltrating cells are well recognized as determinants of prognosis in CC, we propose to characterize tumor immune and stromal markers among distinct CC molecular subtypes and determine their contribution to prognosis (Aim 3). Specifically, we will characterize these transcriptomic markers computationally, and determine whether they can refine molecular subtypes and improve prognostic modeling. Our proposal represents the first comprehensive prediction of CC patient survival using features from both genomic and transcriptomic alterations that will be integrated with immune and stromal markers using state-of-the-art supervised learning approaches. The impact of this work is substantial in that it will identify determinants of recurrence at the molecular pathway level or in the tumor microenvironment, which will help prioritize targets for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the outcome of this grant is expected to have practice-changing implications that can further advance the field of precision oncology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The survival of colon cancer patients varies considerably within the same tumor stage indicating the need for better predictors of outcome. We will use tumor molecular profiling data from clinical trial cohorts to identify subgroups of patients that show differences in outcome and then develop a model that includes both molecular and clinical data to predict survival. This information is critical for determining patient treatment and follow-up approaches that may be practice-changing.",Integration of Genomic and Clinical Data to Enhance Subtyping of Colon Cancer,10070579,R01CA210509,"['Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'BRAF gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colorectal', 'Consensus', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Immune', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infiltration', 'KRAS2 gene', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mutation', 'National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'North Central Cancer Treatment Group', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Staging', 'Staging System', 'Stratification', 'Stromal Cells', 'Stromal Invasion', 'Supervision', 'TNM', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Tumor stage', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'colon cancer patients', 'differential expression', 'follow-up', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'molecular subtypes', 'multiple omics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'precision oncology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'supervised learning', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,407754
"An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oregon Health & Science University and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center have worked over the past decade to develop ex vivo drug profiling to guide a rationale decision-making in assigning drugs to cancer patients, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. A number of recent breakthroughs, many developed through our partnership, have dramatically improved on nearly all aspects of ex vivo drug testing. Our work to date has led to numerous compassionate-use cases as well as new investigator initiated clinical trials. Recognizing the broad utility for a clinic-friendly ex vivo drug sensitivity platform, we set up a commercial entity, SEngine Precision Medicine, whose mission is to provide functional testing of patient derived tumor cells for research, clinical studies, and drug development. Here we seek to move beyond proof of concept in the assay toward wider adoption by cancer research centers, community hospitals, and individual users. We will benchmark the assay’s predictive performance in both “N of 1” settings and in prospective observational studies, and use this baseline performance to drive the development of methods to further improve its predictive value. We will continue to optimize drug selection by integrating ex vivo drug testing with patient specific genomic profiling and clinical data. In parallel, we will develop a reporting system, based upon requirements analysis, for potential end users such as clinicians and academic research centers. OHSU will provide expertise in precision medicine for AML, functional testing of primary leukemia cells, and clinical trials and will assist with assay optimization. FHCRC will provide expertise in functional testing of cells derived from solid tumors, focusing first on breast cancer, cancer genomics, and clinical trials; and will assist with assay optimization and benchmarking. SEngine will develop CLIA certified assays, optimize sample analysis workflows, and develop a reporting system for end users. All three sites will work together to demonstrate inter-institutional proficiency of the assays. At least five additional academic centers have agreed to provide patient derived tumor cells for this project and we anticipate this number will increase during the granting period. The partnering institutions will also provide essential feedback for our performance and reporting system. Our end goals for this project are to produce a refined functional genomic platform based on ex vivo drug screens, a user-friendly reporting interface, and adoption of the technology in the clinical care decision-making process. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ability to provide effective therapy recommendations to cancer patients is limited by our capacity to predict which drugs will work for a given patient. Our platform overcomes this limitation by testing a set of available anti- cancer drugs on tumor cells cultured directly from cancer patients. Through an extensive academic/industry partnership, we propose to refine and benchmark this platform, improve its predictive power, and provide a user- friendly reporting interface to facilitate its adoption by cancer care providers.  ",An Academic-Industry Partnership to Advance Functional Genomics for Personalized Oncology.,10049232,R01CA214428,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'CLIA certified', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Certification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Oncology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Community Hospitals', 'Computational Biology', 'Cultured Tumor Cells', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Designer Drugs', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Industry', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Economics', 'Feedback', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Sciences', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'Observational Study', 'Oregon', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Site', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer genomics', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical research site', 'clinically relevant', 'data integration', 'drug development', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional genomics', 'genomic data', 'genomic platform', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'method development', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'patient response', 'precision medicine', 'precision medicine clinical trials', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'user-friendly']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,599950
"PRECISE - a PErsonalized Risk Score for gastrIc CancEr The National Cancer Institute has called for eliminating disparities in cancer morbidity and mortality through the use of Data Science. Gastric cancer remains one of the most unequally distributed cancers in the United States, with high burden among certain ethnic, racial, and immigrant groups. Identification of individuals at greatest risk for gastric cancer may allow for targeted risk attenuation programs, and improve health equity. Candidate and Career Development Plan: I am a board-certified Gastroenterologist and Master’s degree-trained epidemiologist at Stanford University who seeks to use data science to reduce disparities in cancer outcomes. Based on my training and experience, I have content expertise in gastrointestinal cancer diagnosis, and methodologic expertise in epidemiologic principles and observational study design. In order to achieve my long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator and national leader in cancer disparities research, I require additional quantitative skills (large data analytics, machine learning-based risk prediction, unstructured data extraction using natural language processing), qualitative skills (effective scientific communication, scientific leadership), and professional development. Research Plan: The overarching research aim of this proposal is to develop a PErsonalized Risk Score for gastrIc CancEr (PRECISE) using real-world clinical data sources. My overall hypothesis is that through use of advanced data analytics and deep learning methods, a highly-refined cohort of individuals at highest risk for gastric cancer can be identified. The Specific Aims of this proposal seek to address this hypothesis: (1) to build a personalized risk prediction model using regression, (2) to build a personalized risk prediction model using machine learning algorithms, and (3) to compare regression and machine learning models in electronic health records data. Achievement of these aims will produce a novel, personalized prediction score which will help identify individuals at high risk for gastric cancer and who may benefit from targeted risk attenuation programs. Mentorship Team: To achieve these Aims, I have assembled a world class mentorship team with expertise in epidemiology and health disparities research (Latha Palaniappan, primary mentor), machine learning and natural language processing in EHR data (Tina Hernandez-Boussard, co-mentor), and gastric cancer screening and prevention (Joo Ha Hwang, co-mentor). Environment and Institutional Commitment: Stanford University is a world leader in clinical informatics, epidemiology, and health services research. I will have access to a unique data core, which contains one of the most extensive and robust collections of curated clinical data in the world. My mentorship team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal, and in developing me to become an independent investigator competitive for R-level grants. Gastric cancer is a devastating disease with poor prognosis. The risk for gastric cancer in the general population of the United States is low; however, certain ethnic, racial, and immigrant groups are at much higher risk.

"A scalable non-intrusive image annotation method using eye tracking for training deep learning models in radiology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Machine learning (ML) and artiﬁcial intelligence have recently emerged as powerful techniques that can augment radiology interpretations and show promise for improving patient outcomes. One of the ways for ML to make a signiﬁcant impact on health care is in improving the evaluation of high-volume, low-cost exams for early signs of a wide variety of diseases.The routine chest x-ray is an ”opportunity for screening” for diseases, including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pneumonia and congestive heart failure. For instance, lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the US, and is typically diagnosed at a higher stage than most other cancers leading to low survival rates. The National Lung Screening Trial reported that low dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening resulted in a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality; however, few eli- gible people actually undergo LDCT screening. Meanwhile, chest x-rays continue to be the most common form of imaging worldwide. Improved detection from x-rays can direct patients to LDCT. COPD is another important disease that is often under-diagnosed. People with COPD are at increased risk of lung cancer and respiratory infections, or exacerbations, which are associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, a chest x-ray may show poorly-deﬁned regions of consolidation that are concerning for pneumonia. Medical attention is re- quired to treat an infection or evaluate for other cause. More generally, methods to detect disease on chest x-rays can be extended to cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema and pleural effusions which are seen in congestive heart failure. Improved detection can direct patients to medical care. Convolutional neural networks (CNN), a highly successful ML model, can be applied to chest x-ray images. However, few annotated medical datasets exist that are sufﬁciently large to train CNNs. Furthermore, it has been shown that bounding boxes used to localize disease can be incorporated into the training of CNNs and signiﬁcantly increase their accuracy. Unfortunately, medical datasets with such localized annotations are even rarer and are very limited in the number of cases due to the time-consuming process of creating bounding boxes by radiologists. We propose an innovative integrated approach using eye tracking, speech recording and novel vision and language models to create localized annota- tions in a manner that is non-intrusive to the workﬂow of the radiologist. The novelty of our approach is in the use of eye tracking during routine radiological reading. The challenge is to overcome the relatively ambiguous nature of eye tracking information compared to bounding boxes which provide deﬁnitive information about abnormalities. To address this challenge, we will also design new CNN architectures and learning algorithms that can use eye tracking and additional information such as pupil dilation and ﬁxation duration. The proposed methodology can easily scale up to create very large datasets without generating additional workload for radiologists. Furthermore, deployed in the reading room, it could provide a continuous stream of annotated images to expand training sets. PROJECT NARRATIVE Machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence hold the potential to improve patient outcomes by enhancing the eval- uation of low cost, routine chest x-rays for early imaging abnormalities associated with diseases such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia and making recommendations for follow-up care. To realize their full potential, machine learning algorithms require training on very large datasets with localized an- notations for abnormalities. We propose a novel data collection methodology using eye tracking that is scalable, non-intrusive to the workﬂow of the radiologist, and can generate very large datasets with localized annotations for the development of novel machine learning algorithms to address signiﬁcant medical problems.",A scalable non-intrusive image annotation method using eye tracking for training deep learning models in radiology,10133070,R21EB028367,"['Address', 'Agreement', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caliber', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cardiomegaly', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Eye', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Infection', 'Label', 'Language', 'Localized Disease', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Mydriasis', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Pleural effusion disorder', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Pupil', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Screening Result', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Workload', 'base', 'computed tomography screening', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data collection methodology', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical attention', 'model building', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'radiologist', 'sample fixation', 'scale up', 'screening', 'visual tracking']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2021,152500
"Developing deep learning models for precision oncology Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this study is to develop machine learning methods, especially deep learning models (DLMs), to learn a better representation of activation states of cellular signaling pathways in an individual tumor and use such information to predict its sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs. Cancer is mainly caused by somatic genome alterations (SGAs) that perturb cellular signaling pathways, and aberrations in pathways eventually lead to cancer development. Precision oncology aims to accurately detect and target tumor-specific aberrations, but challenges remain. Currently, there is no well-established method to detect the activation states of signaling pathways, and the common practice of using mutation status of a targeted gene as the indicator for prescribing a molecularly targeted drug has limitations. To overcome such limitation, we hypothesize that, by closely simulating the hierarchical organization of cellular signaling systems, DLMs can be used to systematically identify major cancer signaling pathways, to detect tumor-specific aberrations in signaling pathways, and to predict cancer cell sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs.  We will develop models that more precisely represent the state of signaling systems in cancer cells and use such information to enhance precision oncology. I will design and apply innovative DLMs to cancer big data, including large-scale pharmacogenomic data and cancer omics data to learn unified representation of aberrations in signaling systems caused by driver SGAs in cancer cell, despite of their different growth conditions, such as in cell culture, PDX and real tumor. This will enable us to transfer the models trained using cell lines and PDXs to clinical setting (real tumors) in future. By the nature of drugs that may share common target proteins, we develop model DLM-MLT (the combination of DLM and multi-task learning) to predict the sensitivity of tumor samples to multiple drugs at once. Furthermore, we will develop model BioSI-DLM to use various perturbations (ex. SGA/LINCS perturbation data) as side information to learn better representation that potentially map latent variables in a DLM to biological entities. We hypothesize that the representation learned from our designed models will significantly improve the prediction accuracy compared with the conventional indication for drug treatment (ex. mutation state of the drug targeting protein). In summary, our study uses deep learning based machine learning methods to learn better and concise representation embedded in the cancer omics data to reflect the personalized genomic changes, which could be used to guide the personalized treatment. Our study could significantly contribute to the development of cancer ontology and promote the development of precision medicine. Project Narrative Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. The proposed project aims to develop machine learning methods, especially deep learning, to study cellular signaling systems and disease mechanism. A better representation embedded in the cancer omics data will improve the prediction of drug sensitivity and patient survival. Our study promotes the development of precision medicine to guide the personalized treatment based on patient’s unique genetic changes.",Developing deep learning models for precision oncology,10059265,K99LM013089,"['Antineoplastic Agents', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Oncogenic', 'Ontology', 'PIK3CA gene', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rattus', 'Research Activity', 'Resistance', 'Sampling', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Work', 'Xenograft procedure', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'molecular drug target', 'molecular phenotype', 'multi-task learning', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'response', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2021,91506
"Novel Integrative Approach for the Early Detection of Lung Cancer using Repeated Measures PROJECT SUMMARY Early detection of lung cancer among asymptomatic individuals is a priority for reducing mortality of the number one cancer killer worldwide. Most lung cancers are first detected as indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). While the vast majority of IPNs are benign, those malignant ones present with specific features that should allow for the early discrimination and intervention. We have recently completed a study demonstrating the value of structural imaging features analysis in providing improved accuracy in detection of cancers among IPNs with accuracy of over 90% trained in the NLST and validated in two independent cohorts. The AUC increased from baseline risk estimate of disease using clinical parameters (Mayo model) 0.78 to 0.84 and from 0.82 to 0.92 in two independent validation cohorts. Similarly, we tested the added value of our high sensitivity hsCYFRA 21-1 assay in three populations of lung nodules and obtained similar added value to the MAYO model. Finally, we identified signatures predictive of lung cancer using large scale data mining in the electronic health record (EHR). The performance of the performance of the established imaging predictor, hsCYFRA concentrations and EHR trajectories will be validated in a prospective cohort. In an innovative partnership between pulmonary oncology, radiology, machine learning, and data science experts at Vanderbilt, we propose to integrate the layer of clinical information accessible in the EHR to improve the noninvasive diagnosis accuracy. In addition, we propose to take advantage of repeated measures to improve the accuracy of the prediction of cancer and to reduce the time to diagnosis. We therefore propose the following aims. In Aim 1 we will validate advanced quantitative imaging analyses to distinguish early benign from malignant IPNs based on repeated measures of 1000 individuals. In Aim 2. We will test in 150 individuals with lung nodules the added value of repeated measures of hsCYFRA 21- 1 protein blood biomarker in diagnostic accuracy over the baseline concentrations of the biomarker. In Aim 3 we will test a deep learning strategy from the EHR of 20,000 patients from VUMC to identify patterns likely to improve the early detection of lung cancer, and in Aim 4 we will test the added value of monitoring changes in levels of the markers for early detection using repeated pre-diagnosis chest CT studies, serum analysis of hsCYFRA 21- 1, and EHR patterns from our lung cancer screening program. Built upon strong preliminary data and unique resources from VUMC that include access to large imaging and HER data sources this novel integrative study has the potential to generate highly impactful and translatable results to reduce false positive rates among IPNs, and morbidity and mortality from lung cancer. This application responds to PAR 19-264 using low-dose lung screening computed tomography longitudinal analysis integrated with a lead serum biomarker and the power of artificial intelligence to mine the EHR for the discovery of a novel integrative strategy for the early detection of premetastatic lung cancer. NARRATIVE Most lung cancers present as pulmonary nodules; so, to improve survival from lung cancer, we need to identify with noninvasive strategies the disease early among a majority of benign nodules. This project focuses on establishing an integrative approach to early detection leveraging repeated measures of chest CT imaging features of lung nodules over time, of the rate of change of a high sensitivity blood biomarker hsCYFRA 21-1, and of longitudinal clinical patterns from the electronic health record. This research will inform the management of lung nodules identified on lung cancer screening CT scans, and should reduce the time to diagnosis and the mortality of lung cancer.",Novel Integrative Approach for the Early Detection of Lung Cancer using Repeated Measures,10069919,R01CA253923,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Markers', 'Community Hospitals', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nodule', 'Oncology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Radiation', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Study of serum', 'Testing', 'Thoracotomy', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biological specimen archives', 'biomedical informatics', 'blood-based biomarker', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computed tomography screening', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'early detection biomarkers', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal analysis', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'machine learning method', 'molecular marker', 'mortality', 'neural network algorithm', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'premalignant', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'rate of change', 'research clinical testing', 'screening program', 'serial imaging']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,682056
"Sustaining the Integrative Imaging Informatics for Cancer Research (I3CR) Center Abstract Artificial intelligence (AI) and other computationally intensive methods have the potential to revolutionize cancer imaging research and patient care. The broad adoption of these technologies depends on the availability development of imaging informatics tools to assist users in managing massive data sets, generating well-curated annotations, and accessing scalable computing resources. The Integrative Imaging Informatics for Cancer Research (I3CR) Center has played a lead role in implementing cancer imaging informatics technology, with a focus on expanding the widely used open source XNAT informatics platform to better support computational workflows in cancer imaging. I3CR has also developed knowledge management tools to better track data processing and analysis, including tools for orchestrating and tracking container-based computing pipelines. As result of this work, XNAT has emerged as the most widely used imaging informatics platform in cancer research. It is deployed in over 200 organizations across academia and industry and has been adopted across a wide range of research contexts, including preclinical imaging, multi-site clinical trials, and clinical translation. As the I3CR informatics platform has matured and been widely adopted, the Center is now evolving to the next phase of development to more broadly sustain the platform. In the work proposed here, we will sustain the I3CR’s ongoing engineering initiatives and expand its outreach efforts. The Center’s sustainment activities will build on and extend the I3CR platform’s expansive set of data and knowledge management capabilities, with a focus on addressing key emergent needs within our user base. In Aim 1, we will continue to develop the XNAT-based data management platform, including adding standards-based clinical interfaces, developing a cohort discovery service with natural language processing support, implementing a task automation service, and extending its container-based computing service to support high performance computing and cloud computing environments. In Aim 2, we will implement a suite of integrations with complementary image analysis and data sharing platforms, including The Cancer Image Archive and the NCI Imaging Data Commons. In Aim 3, we will expand the I3CR’s outreach initiatives to ensure broad and effective adoption of the I3CR informatics platforms. The Center’s training program will utilize the XNAT Academy education platform to host a series of online training programs directed at specific audiences including developers, data scientists, integrators, and system administrators. A suite of supporting cloud services will be implemented assist the community in adopting and developing on the I3CR platform. Relevance Medical imaging is one of the key methods used by cancer researchers to study human biology in health and disease.

"The Pediatric Advanced Cancer Experience (PACE): Measuring Quality of End-of-Life Care for Children with Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Although cure rates for childhood cancer have increased over several decades, cancer remains the leading cause of non-accidental death in children. Yet, there are no existing quality measures to define optimal end-of- life care (EOLC) for children with cancer. A lack of standards for EOLC contributes to high healthcare utilization for children with advanced, incurable cancer, as well as widely variable palliative care provision. For adults with cancer, high quality EOLC is defined at least in part by measures to reduce use of intensive healthcare resources, such as avoidance of hospital stays in the last weeks of life and prompt referral to hospice. In contrast, attributes of high quality EOLC for children with cancer have not been previously elucidated. To address this gap in knowledge, the overall objectives of this proposal are to prioritize family-centered quality measures for EOLC and to pioneer complementary approaches to assess care quality for children with advanced cancer. Specific aims are to: (1) establish a priority list of EOLC quality measures, from the perspective of parents of children with cancer; (2) characterize EOLC process measures for children who died of cancer, using natural language processing in electronic health records; and (3) develop and pilot the “Pediatric Advanced Cancer Experience” (PACE) questionnaire to prospectively appraise care quality for children with advanced cancer. Completion of these aims will lay the foundation for the first multi-center, multi- modal evaluation of end-of-life care quality in children with cancer. The long term goal of Dr. Ananth’s research program is to build a platform for systematically measuring, reporting, and incentivizing high quality EOLC in children with cancer, facilitating goal-concordant care delivery. Through the proposed research, Dr. Ananth seeks to advance the science of measuring EOLC quality in childhood cancer. Dr. Ananth is supported by an outstanding mentorship team and scientific advisory committee, with substantial expertise spanning patient- reported outcomes, artificial intelligence-based techniques for research, and pediatric palliative care investigation. Dr. Ananth will pursue formal training in patient-centered quality measurement, natural language processing, and questionnaire design and validation, concurrently building skills in leadership of a multi-center consortium. Collectively, the research in this proposal and career development plan will amply prepare her for an independent career focused on enhancing quality of care for children with advanced, incurable cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although most children with cancer are cured long-term, 10-15% of children will ultimately develop advanced, incurable illness, rendering cancer the leading cause of non-accidental death in children. Currently, no measures exist to assess the quality of care children with cancer receive near the end of life. The proposed research will help develop family-centered measures of high quality end-of-life care and test novel methods of evaluating quality.",The Pediatric Advanced Cancer Experience (PACE): Measuring Quality of End-of-Life Care for Children with Cancer,10190336,K08CA259222,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Advisory Committees', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Bereavement', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Development Plans', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Incentives', 'Intubation', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Length of Stay', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Non-accidental', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Palliative Care', 'Parents', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Process Measure', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Psychometrics', 'Quality of Care', 'Questionnaire Designs', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Technics', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer care', 'care delivery', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'end of life', 'end of life care', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'health care service utilization', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'preference', 'programs', 'prospective', 'skills', 'tool', 'trend']",NCI,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,220150
"Extraction of Symptom Burden from Clinical Narratives of Cancer Patients using Natural Language Processing Project Summary / Abstract Cancer patients frequently experience high levels of pain, tiredness, shortness of breath, decreased appetite, nausea, drowsiness, anxiety, and decreased sense of wellbeing, often related to the disease itself, its treatments, or both. This high symptom burden leads to significant impairment of cancer patients’ quality of life and may be associated with impaired survival. Optimal symptom management is required to minimize symptom burden and maximize quality of life for cancer patients throughout the course of their disease. Supportive care in cancer (SCC) teams are multidisciplinary teams that are focused on the prevention and management of the adverse effects of cancer and its treatments across the continuum of the cancer experience from diagnosis through treatment and beyond. These teams typically lack the resources to see all cancer patients and need to prioritize patients with the highest need, often relying on oncology physicians for referral. However, oncology physicians are often too focused on curing cancer than treating its symptoms. As a result, SCC services are often accessed by chance even when available, often later in the cancer trajectory. To improve recognition of SCC needs and to identify the symptom burden of cancer patients for better management and care, we propose to build natural language processing (NLP) approaches that can automatically extract symptom information from unstructured narratives. The proposed systems will utilize neural nets and build on the state of the art information extraction methods. To accomplish our goals, we will create a dataset of clinical notes for a large cohort of prostate cancer and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated in Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) and Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) between 1.1.2015 and 1.1.2020. We focus on these two types of cancer as examples of two very different and prevalent cancer types. We propose to represent symptom burden documented in clinical narratives with a generalizable frame representation that captures fine-grained details including presence/absence, change-of- state, severity, characteristics, duration, frequency, and anatomy information related to patient symptoms. We will use active learning to create a diverse and representative gold standard annotated with symptom frames to train and test the proposed neural-based NLP approaches. All models and their implementations produced during the execution of this project will be shared with the community as open source resources. After successful completion of the project, the developed NLP methods will be integrated into the information access methods of SCCA and HCI clinical repositories. Project Narrative Cancer patients commonly experience pain, tiredness, shortness of breath, decreased appetite, nausea, drowsiness, anxiety, and decreased sense of wellbeing as well as impaired quality of life due to complications of the cancer itself, and/or cancer treatments. In this project, we will develop natural language processing (NLP) approaches to automatically extract detailed symptom information documented in clinical narratives of a large cohort of prostate cancer and Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) patients treated in Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA) and Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) between 1.1.2015 and 1.1.2020.

"Deep learning of drug sensitivity and genetic dependency of pediatric cancer cells Summary/Abstract The development of novel therapies for pediatric cancers, the second leading cause of death in children, is challenging due to the lack of comprehensive pharmacogenomics resources, unlike the well-established ones in adult cancers. However, breakthroughs in deep learning methods allow learning of intricate pharmacogenomics patterns with unprecedented performance. With a uniquely cross-disciplinary background, the candidate for this proposed K99/R00 has already, as a postdoctoral fellow, (i) developed and published several deep learning models that accurately predicted adult cancer cells’ drug sensitivity and genetic dependency using high- throughput genomics profiles, and (ii) demonstrated the feasibility of transferring the model to predict tumors by a ‘transfer learning’ design. The candidate will extend this research to study pediatric cancers and test the central hypothesis that deep learning extracts genomics signatures to predict the responses of pediatric cancer cells to chemical and genetic perturbations. The proposed study will develop novel deep learning models for predicting drug sensitivity and/or genetic dependency for (Aim 1) currently un-screened pediatric cancer cell lines by learning from screens of adult cells, and (Aim 2) pediatric tumors by learning from adult and/or pediatric cells. Prediction results will be validated by in vitro experiments and data collected from patient-derived xenografts. The proposed study is the first attempt to employ modern computational methods to advance pharmacogenomics studies of pediatric cancer, which would be difficult and costly to pursue via biological assays. Findings will shed light on the optimal drugs and novel therapeutic targets for pediatric malignancies, leading to an optimal and efficient design of preclinical tests. The candidate has a remarkable track record of bioinformatics studies of adult cancer genomics. The focus of this K99 training plan is to develop in-depth understanding of pediatric cancer and preclinical treatment models, and strengthen multifaceted components needed for a successful research career in cancer bioinformatics. The primary mentor, Dr. Peter Houghton, is a renowned leader in pediatric cancer research and preclinical drug testing programs. The candidate also has assembled an outstanding mentor team: Dr. Yidong Chen (co-mentor), a cancer genomics expert and pioneer in bioinformatics analysis of high-throughput technologies; Dr. Jinghui Zhang (collaborator), a computational biologist and leader in integrative genomics studies of major pediatric cancer genome consortiums; Dr. Yufei Huang (collaborator), an expert in state-of-the-art deep learning methods; and two highly knowledgeable consultants with relevant expertise. With this team’s guidance and structured training activities in an ideal training environment, the candidate will strengthen his skills in grant writing and lab management, teaching and mentoring, and broad connections. Overall, the K99/R00 award will be an indispensable support for a timely transition of the candidate to a successful career as a multifaceted, cross-disciplinary investigator in cancer bioinformatics. Narrative Pediatric cancer is the second leading cause of death in children, and genetic studies to inform new drug therapies have been challenging. The proposal will utilize deep learning bioinformatics methods to transfer well-established pharmacogenomics knowledge for adult cancers to the study of pediatric cancers.

"Multimodal computational models to stratify ovarian cancer patients Project Summary/Abstract High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, with a five-year survival rate of less than 30% for metastatic disease. Our lab has identified mutational processes as predictors of survival and response to therapy, along with a working model to predict homologous recombination deficiency from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) whole-slide images. Our collaborators in diagnostic radiology have discovered robust associations between BRCA mutational status and qualitative features on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT). These two imaging modalities, however, have yet to be combined with genomic information to improve stratification of HGSC patients. Based on these preliminary data, I will test the hypothesis that combined mesoscopic information in CE-CT and microscopic information in H&E can be used to infer known mutational subtypes and also to identify novel patient strata. I have curated a cohort of 118 HGSC patients with matched targeted panel-based genome sequencing, scanned H&E whole-slide images, and segmented pre-treatment CE-CT images for this purpose. In Specific Aim 1, I will develop a machine learning model to integrate CE-CT and H&E imaging to predict mutational subtype from these ubiquitous imaging modalities. In Specific Aim 2, I will develop an end-to-end deep learning model to integrate the complementary information from CE-CT, H&E, and genome sequencing for survival analysis using a Cox Proportional Hazards model. I anticipate that this work will (1) identify refined stratification of HGSC patients using this multimodal prognostic signature and (2) develop a general-purpose machine learning model to integrate CE-CT, H&E, and genomic sequencing for cancer patient survival analysis. This research will be conducted at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center under the mentorship of Dr. Sohrab Shah. The training plan that Dr. Shah and I have developed will prepare me well for a future as a physician- scientist conducting machine learning research for cancer patient prognosis. Project Narrative Mutational subtypes of high-grade serous ovarian cancer stratify patients by clinical outcome, yet genomic sequencing omits spatial information with potential prognostic relevance. In the proposed project, I aim to (1) infer mutational subtype by combining radiologic and histologic imaging and (2) identify refined patient strata by integrating radiologic and histologic imaging with genomic sequencing. Completion of this work will identify new strata of ovarian cancer patients and result in new machine learning models to integrate cancer imaging with genomic sequencing.",Multimodal computational models to stratify ovarian cancer patients,10146152,F30CA257414,"['Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Eosine Yellowish', 'Future', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genomics', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Joints', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Measures', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Platinum', 'Point Mutation', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Serous', 'Slide', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer genome', 'cancer imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genome sequencing', 'health care settings', 'histological image', 'homologous recombination', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'large datasets', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'multimodality', 'mutational status', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'standard of care', 'survival prediction', 'targeted sequencing', 'tumor', 'whole genome', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,F30,2021,51036
"Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors Project Summary The overall goal of this project is to develop a new diagnostic tool, called Cyst-X, for accurate detection and characterization of pre-cancerous pancreatic cysts and improve patient outcome through precise decisions (surgical resection or surveillance). Pancreatic cancer is the most fatal cancer among all cancers due to its poor prognosis and lack of early detection methods. Unlike other common cancers where precursor lesions are well known (colon polyps-colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)-breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors (cysts) are poorly understood. Diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages may decrease mortality and morbidity rates of this lethal disease. One major approach for diagnosing pancreatic cancer at earlier stages is to target pancreatic precancerous pancreatic neoplasms (cysts) before they turn into invasive cancer. Once cysts are detected with radiology imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), they should be characterized with respect to their malignant potential. Low-risk cysts remain harmless; hence, patients should remain under surveillance program. On the other hand, high-risk cysts can progress into an aggressive cancer, therefore, patients should undergo surgical resection if possible. Despite this, international guidelines for risk stratification of pancreatic cysts are woefully deficient (55-76% accuracy for determining characteristics of low-risk vs high risk cystic tumors, while only 40-50% accuracy detecting cysts with MRI). Combined, these critical barriers indicate that there is an urgent need for improving characterization of pancreatic cystic tumors. Based on our preliminary results, which support the development of an image-based diagnostic decision tool, we hypothesize that our proposed Cyst-X will produce higher diagnostic accuracy for characterizing pancreatic cysts and provide better patient management compared to the current guidelines. Towards this overarching hypothesis, we will first use powerful deep learning methods (specifically deep capsule networks) for automatically detecting and segmenting the pancreas and pancreatic cysts from multi-sequence MRI scans (Aim 1). Next, we will create an interpretable image-based diagnosis model for characterizing pancreatic cysts (Aim 2). Accurate characterization is necessary for such a diagnostic model; however, emphasis will also be placed on interpretability of the machine generated diagnostic model. Visual explanation of the discriminative features will help radiologists obtain higher decision rates in patient management. In Aim 3, we will validate the proposed Cyst-X framework in a multi-center study. A total of 1200 multi-sequence MRI scans will be collected from three participating clinical centers (Mayo Clinic, Columbia University Medical Center, Erasmus Medical Center). Comprehensive evaluations will be made to test the validity and generalizability of Cyst-X. All evaluations will be made with respect to the international guidelines and biopsy proven ground truths. Our proposed study has wide implications: specifically, in the long term, it will influence early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer and clinical decision making to improve survival rates of pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Unlike other common cancers for which early detection and surgical resection have reduced cancer deaths (e.g. colon polyps for colon cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ lesions and breast cancer), pancreas cancer precursors, such as commonly observed pancreatic cysts, are poorly understood. Towards the long-term goal of early detection of pancreatic cancer, our objective in this proposal is to accurately detect and characterize pancreatic cysts before they turn into aggressive cancer. The outcome of this research will be a new diagnostic tool, named Cyst-X, which will establish a better clinical strategy than the current guidelines by recommending a more selective use of invasive testing, surgery, and surveillance.",Cyst-X: Interpretable Deep Learning Based Risk Stratification of Pancreatic Cystic Tumors,10391173,R01CA246704,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Cyst', 'Cystic Neoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epithelial cyst', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'High Prevalence', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'In Situ Lesion', 'Individual', 'International', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucinous Cystadenoma', 'Mucinous Neoplasm', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Names', 'Noninfiltrating Intraductal Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pancreas', 'Pancreatectomy', 'Pancreatic Cyst', 'Pancreatic cystic neoplasia', 'Papillary', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Serous Cystadenoma', 'Side', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Program', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Visual', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cancer invasiveness', 'cancer type', 'capsule', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'detection method', 'detection platform', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'efficacy validation', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome forecast', 'pancreatic neoplasm', 'premalignant', 'prognostic significance', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'stem', 'tool']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,438819
"SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications Cancer is considered one of the most dilapidating health problems that the world is facing due to its physical, emotional, financial, and spiritual toll. Automating cancer diagnosis can ultimately impact its treatment and recovery. Computational algorithmic methods can greatly improve the efficiency of pathologists through partial or complete automation of the diagnostic process. Computer-aided diagnosis has augmented preventive check-ups for many medical conditions like breast cancer, colonic polyps, and lung cancer. Digitization of tissue slides has thus opened up the process of diagnosis through analysis of digital images. The dearth of highly trained pathologists who can address the growing diagnostic needs heightens the importance of such automation. Recent advances in big data analytics and in particular machine learning can possibly impact greatly the domain of computer-aided cancer diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in particular have already revolutionized the domain of computer vision with performances in various cases compared to that exhibited by humans. One of the main factors that fueled the recent resurgence of CNNs is the availability of large datasets. CNNs adjust, via training, millions of parameters allowing them to learn complex and highly nonlinear dependencies among data (i.e., images). However, collecting such large amounts of annotated data (assigning them to one of many possible categories, e.g., benign vs. cancerous vs. other stages) is either challenging or very expensive or in many cases unavailable. This is definitely the case of the medical domain. Tissue slides from suspected cancerous regions are examined under a microscope and are classified as benign or malignant. CNNs offer a promising pathway to achieve some degree of automation in identifying cancerous cases in image data. This research work will explore the challenges· of discovering the underlying discriminative features, hidden in the image and possibly different than those used by human experts, in order to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. We will also focus on algorithms to minimize the amount of data required to train the neural network without sacrificing performance and generalization. Cancer has been a major health concern and one of the leading causes of death in the US and around the world. Automating cancer diagnosis can impact cancer staging and ultimately its treatment, effectively leading to higher survival rates. This proposal' promises the creation of computational algorithmic methods that can lead to partial or complete automation of the cancer diagnostic process.",SCH: Active Learning for Medical Applications,10086856,R01CA225435,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Big Data Methods', 'Breast', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancerous', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Collaborations', 'Colonic Polyps', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotional', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Information Retrieval', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Middle School Student', 'Modality', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Security', 'Slide', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Variant', 'Visual Manifestations', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'cohesion', 'convolutional neural network', 'data exploration', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital imaging', 'hands-on learning', 'histological slides', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'kidney imaging', 'large datasets', 'learning community', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'neural network', 'object recognition', 'online repository', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'phenomenological models', 'programs', 'repository', 'self-directed learning', 'stem', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web page', 'wiki']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,309176
"HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification ABSTRACT: Roughly 40% of the US population will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetime. In a majority of these cases, a definitive cancer diagnosis is only possible via histopathologic confirmation using a tissue slide. Increasingly, these slides are being digitally scanned as high-resolution images for usage in both clinical and research digital pathology (DP) workflows. Our group has been pioneering the use of deep learning (DL), a form of machine learning, for segmentation, detection, and classification of various cancers using digital pathology images. DL learns features and their associated weighting from large datasets to maximally discriminate between user labeled data (e.g., cancer vs non-cancer, nuclei vs non-nuclei); a paradigm known as “learn from data”. Unfortunately, this paradigm makes DL especially sensitive to low quality slides, noise induced by small errors in the manual user labeling process, and general dataset heterogeneity. As many groups do not intentionally account for these problems, they learn that successful employment of DL technologies relies heavily on explicitly addressing challenges associated with (a) carefully curating high quality slides without preparation or scanning artifacts, (b) obtaining a large precise collection of annotations delineating objects of interest, and (c) selecting diverse datasets to ensure robust classifier performance when clinically deploying the model. To address these challenges we propose HistoTools, a suite of three modules or “Apps”: (1) HistoQC examines slides for artifacts and computes metrics associated with slide presentation characteristics (e.g., stain intensity, compression levels) helping to quantify ranges of acceptable characteristics for downstream algorithmic evaluation. (2) HistoAnno drastically improves the efficiency of annotation efforts using a combined active learning and deep learning approach to ensure experts focus only on regions which are important for classifier improvement. (3) HistoFinder aids in selecting suitable training and test cohorts to guarantee that various tissue level characteristics are well balanced, leading to increased reproducibility. Our team already has working prototypes of HistoQC (100% concordance with a pathologist, evaluated on n>1200 slides) and HistoAnno (30% efficiency improvement during annotation tasks). In this U01, we seek to further develop and evaluate HistoTools in the context of enhancing two companion diagnostic (CDx) assays being developed in our group. First, we will use HistoTools to quality control and annotate nuclei, tubules, and mitosis for improving our CDx classifier for predicting recurrence in breast cancers using a cohort of n>900 patients from completed trial ECOG 2197. Secondly, HistoTools will be employed for quality control and identification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and cancer nuclei towards improving our CDx classifier for predicting response to immunotherapy in lung cancer using the n>700 patients from completed clinical trials Checkmate 017 and 057. These tools will build on our existing open source tool repository to aid in real-time feedback and dissemination throughout the ITCR and cancer research community. RELEVANCE: This project will result in development of HistoTools, a new digital pathology toolkit for common pre-experiment machine learning tasks in the oncology domain such as (a) timely identification of poor quality slides and slide regions, (b) quantitative metrics driving optimized cohort selection, and (c) generation of highly precise and relevant annotations. Each component is designed to directly combat an existing bottleneck in the evolving usage of digital pathology. HistoTools will significantly enhance the functionality of existing toolboxes and pipelines, facilitating increasingly sophisticated machine learning applications in oncology.","HistoTools:  A suite of digital pathology tools for quality control, annotation and dataset identification",10116983,U01CA239055,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology', 'Automobile Driving', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Immunotherapy', 'International', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Mitosis', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Nivolumab', 'Noise', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nuclear', 'Oncology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Slide', 'Societies', 'Stains', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Imaging Archive', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer recurrence', 'cohort', 'combat', 'companion diagnostics', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'experimental study', 'heterogenous data', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning network', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'photonics', 'predicting response', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'quantitative imaging', 'repository', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,U01,2021,1
"Histopathology correlated quantitative analysis of lung nodules with LDCT for early detection of lung cancer Lung cancer is a leading cause of death in the United States. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that more lung cancers can be detected at an early stage with low dose CT screening. However, over-diagnosis of indolent lung cancer and benign nodules is one of the major limitations of screening, resulting in unnecessary treatment, biopsy, follow-up, increased radiation exposure, patient anxiety, and cost. Due to a lack of in-depth knowledge of the correlation of structural image features and histologic findings of lung nodules and the absence of validated diagnostic biomarkers for accurate disease categorization, the current diagnosis and management of the screen-detected nodules remains challenging.  The goal of this proposed project is to develop a decision support system (DSS) based on quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) of pulmonary nodules using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to characterize the histopathologic features of nodules and analyze their correlations with CT image features for improvement of early detection of lung cancer. We hypothesize that the proposed q-PCD analysis will have strong association with histopathologic characterization, and therefore will be a more effective biomarker for differentiation of invasive, pre-invasive, and benign nodules than conventional image-based features or radiologists' visual judgement. Accurate characterization of the nodule types will assist radiologists in making decision for management of the detected nodules; e.g., enabling early detection and treatment of invasive lung cancer, safe surveillance or replacing lobectomy with limited sublobar resection for pre-invasive lung cancer, and sparing biopsy of benign nodules, thereby reducing morbidity and costs in lung cancer screening programs. Our major specific aims are to 1) collect a large database of LDCT screening cases from NLST project and our institute to develop automated image analysis methods, 2) to develop a new DSS based on quantitative pathologic correlated CT descriptors (q-PCD) of lung nodules, 3) validate the effectiveness of DSS in lung cancer diagnosis. To achieve these aims, we will collect a large data set from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and our institute. The collected database will include the baseline and follow up scans, pathology data, demographic information and other information provided by NLST. We will develop automated segmentation methods to extract the volumes of the solid and sub-solid components of detected lung nodules, develop quantitative methods to characterize the radiologic and pathologic features of lung nodules as well as the surrounding lung parenchyma, develop a novel radiopathomics strategy to correlate pathomics with radiomics, and to identify new imaging biomarkers. We will develop a clinically-translatable DSS with a joint biomarker combining both image and patient information, and evaluate its performance in lung cancer diagnosis, including its effectiveness in baseline screening CT exams and in follow up exams. Narrative: Lung cancer is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in both men and women in the United States. If successful, we will have developed an automated low dose CT-based quantitative histopathology correlated CT descriptor (q-PCD) which can be included as an independent factor to improve the diagnosis of screening detected nodules.

A major reason for the lethal nature of this disease is the lack of effective strategies for early detection. As a result, the vast majority of cancers are detected at a very late stage. The delay in diagnosis and treatment of pancreatic cancer could be due to many reasons including, 1) lack of a clear quantitative or algorithm-based definition of a high-risk population who would benefit from active surveillance, 2) suboptimal use of image findings that could potentially foretell a growing tumor, 3) system or referral-related delay from time of abnormal finding to diagnosis and treatment. Methods to accelerate the detection of pancreatic cancer leading to increased proportion of early stage tumors at the time of diagnosis have the potential to have an immediate impact on survival. The objective of the proposed work is to establish a platform for development and implementation of a data-driven approach for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer within an integrated care setting. Specifically, the proposed work will focus on development of empiric algorithms for prediction of early stage pancreatic cancer as well as systematic pancreatic cancer-risk stratification of patients based on natural language processing-aided extraction of pancreatic features from existing pre-diagnostic imaging reports to enhance understanding of the natural history of disease progression. Finally, we will conduct a prospective cohort study to assess the accuracy of an algorithm-based approach for detection of early stage pancreatic cancer. Project Narrative Pancreatic cancer is most often diagnosed in a late, incurable stage. Population-based screening is not effective based on the relatively low incidence of this disease. The current study seeks to develop and apply an alternative approach to enhance our ability to identify patients with early stage pancreatic cancer through use of an electronic ‘trigger’ system based on information gathered from large electronic health systems.",PRedictiOn Algorithms for the DeTECTion of Early Stage Pancreatic Cancer (PRO-TECT),10201527,R01CA230442,"['Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Future', 'Health Information System', 'Health system', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Laboratory Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Pancreas', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tumor stage', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans Health Administration', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'detection platform', 'disease natural history', 'electronic data', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk population', 'patient stratification', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'repository', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'tumor']",NCI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,816240
"Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Most colorectal cancer cases start as a small growth, known as a polyp, on the lining of the colon or rectum. Although colorectal polyps are precursors to colorectal cancer, it takes several years for these polyps to potentially transform into cancer. If colorectal polyps are detected early, they can be removed before they can progress to cancer. The microscopic examination of stained tissue from colorectal polyps on glass slides—the practice of histopathology—is a key part of colorectal cancer screening and forms the current basis for prognosis and patient management. Histopathological characterization of polyps is an important principle for determining the risk of colorectal cancer and future rates of surveillance for patients; however, it is time- intensive, requires years of specialized training, and suffers from high variability and low accuracy. In addition, as is evident by the domain literature, other health factors, such as medical and family history, play an important role in colorectal cancer risk; however, they are not considered in current standard guidelines for colorectal cancer risk assessment. Therefore, there is a critical need for computational tools that can incorporate both histopathological and relevant clinical/familial information to help clinicians better characterize colorectal polyps and more accurately assess risk for colorectal cancer. To address this critical need, this application proposes to build a novel, automatic, image-analysis method that can accurately detect and classify different types of colorectal polyps on whole-slide microscopic images. The proposed approach will be able to identify discriminative regions and features on these images for each colorectal polyp type, which will provide support and insight into the automatic detection of colorectal polyps on whole-slide images. Finally, this project will provide an accurate risk prediction model to integrate visual histology features from microscopic images with other risk factors and relevant clinical information from medical records for a comprehensive colorectal cancer risk assessment. The proposed image analysis and prediction methods in this project are based on a novel deep-learning methodology and rely on numerous levels of abstraction for data representation and analysis. The technology developed in this proposal will be rigorously validated on data from patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening at the investigators’ academic medical center and on the records from the New Hampshire statewide colonoscopy data registry. Upon successful completion of this project, the proposed bioinformatics approach is expected to reduce the cognitive burden on pathologists and improve their accuracy and efficiency in the histopathological characterization of colorectal polyps and in subsequent risk assessment and follow-up recommendations. As a result, this project can have a significant, positive impact on improving the efficacy of colorectal cancer screening programs, precision medicine, and public health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States; however, it can be prevented through regular screening. The proposed project is expected to reduce the manual burden and potential errors of diagnosis, risk assessment, and follow-up recommendations in colorectal cancer screening. Therefore, the outcomes of this project can potentially reduce screening time and costs, eliminate undue stress to patients, increase the coverage and accuracy of screening programs, and overall reduce colorectal cancer mortality.",Improving Colorectal Cancer Screening and Risk Assessment through Deep Learning on Medical Images and Records,10085670,R01LM012837,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Colorectal Polyp', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperplastic Polyp', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modeling', 'New Hampshire', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Polyps', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive load', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer progression', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diagnostic technologies', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'histopathological examination', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient health information', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'screening program', 'translational impact', 'tv watching', 'whole slide imaging']",NLM,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,356700
"Large scale clinical and economic impact analysis of potentially malignant incidental findings in radiology reports Abstract Unexpected findings, or incidentalomas, are increasing dramatically with the growth in the use of imaging technology within healthcare organizations. Incidentalomas may indicate significant health problems, such as malignancy in the medium or long term. However, they also may lead to overinvestigation, unnecessary radiation exposure, overtreatment, substantial downstream expenditures, and patient anxiety. Several systematic reviews have explored the prevalence and outcomes of incidentalomas. These studies used inconsistent and often inappropriate synthesis methods, commonly only focusing on one imaging scan or organ in a very limited number of patients. As a result, there is need for large-scale study of incidentalomas that can inform their follow up and guide efforts to optimize health outcomes. To address this need, we propose to build natural language processing (NLP) approaches to identify cancer-related incidentalomas reported in radiology reports (Aim 1) and to create the first large-scale incidentaloma database covering over half-a-million patients (Aim 2). Our research dataset will contain radiology reports, clinical notes containing imaging orders, as well as structured data such as demographic information (e.g., age) and diagnoses codes of patients who received radiologic imaging tests in University of Washington Medical Center (UWMC), Harborview Medical Center (HMC), Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA), and Northwest Hospital and Medical Center (NWMC) between 2007-2019. Our patient population will be linked to Hutchinson Institute for Cancer Outcomes Research (HICOR) data repository for detailed cancer outcomes and claims data. The created database will be used for clinical and economic analysis of incidentalomas (Aim 3). We will (1) evaluate the concordance between radiologists' documentation of incidentaloma follow-up and established clinical guidelines for thyroid, lung, adrenal, kidney, liver, and pancreas incidentalomas, (2) determine risk of subsequent cancer diagnosis and median survival for each category of incidentaloma, and (3) determine the incremental cost associated with follow-up imaging in patients with incidentalomas. All models and their implementations produced during the execution of this project will be shared with the community as open source. Additionally, the de-identified incidentaloma database will be made available to the research community under a data use agreement. By identifying risk factors for cancer diagnosis and death for common incidental findings, we will be able to provide critical information for future clinical practice guideline development and appropriate use criteria. We assembled a highly interdisciplinary team of experts in NLP, medical informatics, radiology, oncology, health outcomes, and health economics to ensure the successful completion of the proposed project. Project Narrative Incidentalomas may indicate significant health problems, such as malignancy to the patient in the short or medium term, but also may lead to overtreatment, which comes with substantial downstream expenditures as well as patient anxiety. In this project, we will build natural language processing approaches to extract cancer related incidentalomas reported in radiology reports (Aim 1) and create the first large scale incidentaloma database for half-a-million patients who received radiologic imaging tests in University of Washington Medical Center, Harborview Medical Center, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, and Northwest Hospital and Medical Center between 2007 and 2019 (Aim 2).

"The benefits and harms of lung cancer screening in Florida PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death in both men and women in the United States. Currently, approximately 70% of lung cancer patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, and the 5-year survival rate of advanced stage lung cancer is very low, at only 16%. Investigators have been searching for effective screening modalities for the early detection of lung cancer so that patients can receive curative treatments at an early stage. When the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) demonstrated the effectiveness of using low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan for lung cancer screening (LCS), researchers and physicians hope to save lives from lung cancer by screening high-risk population who aged 55 to 77 years and have a 30 pack years making history or former smokes who have quitted within the past 15 years. Since the release of the landmark NLST results, many medical associations published guidelines to recommend LDCT-based screening for individuals at high risk for lung cancer and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also decided to cover the LCS for Medicare beneficiaries who are at high risk for lung cancer. While many efforts have been made to accelerate the dissemination the beneficial LCS, the concerns over the high false positive rates (96.4% of the positive results), invasive diagnostic procedures, postprocedural complications and health care costs may hinder the utilization of lung cancer screening. This concern was magnified as researchers and policy makers started questioning whether the complication rate and false positives in real-world settings would be even higher than the rates reported in the NLST, which was conducted in a setting with well-established facilities and proficiency in cancer care. Therefore, we propose to understand the contemporary use of lung cancer screening and associated health care outcomes and costs using data from a real-world setting. Our study has three goals: 1) to develop an innovative computable phenotype algorithm to identify high-risk and low-risk individuals for LCS from both structured and unstructured (i.e., clinical notes) electronic health record (EHR) data and to develop advanced natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract LCS related clinical information from clinical notes such as radiology reports; 2) to determine the appropriate and inappropriate use of LDCT among high-risk and low-risk individuals in Florida and to examine the test results of LDCT, the rates of invasive diagnostic procedures, postprocedural complications, and incidental findings in real-world settings; and 3) to develop and validate a microsimulation model of the clinical courses of LCS incorporating the real-world data in LCS to estimate the long-term benefits and the cost-effectiveness of LCS. Our proposed study has the potential to reduce lung cancer incidence and mortality by informing policymakers and practitioners on the appropriateness of contemporary use of LCS. This knowledge will help both patients and physicians better understand the harm- benefit tradeoff of lung cancer screening and transform such knowledge into practice to prevent avoidable postprocedural complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lung cancer screening using Low-dose computed tomography is a promising technique to reduce the burden of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Concerns over high false positives, invasive diagnostic procedures, postprocedural complications, and downstream health care costs impede developing and promoting lung cancer screening program. Our research is to leverage a large repository of linked electronic health record (EHR) and administrative claims data to understand contemporary use of lung cancer screening and the associated health care outcomes and costs in a real-world setting.",The benefits and harms of lung cancer screening in Florida,10070599,R01CA246418,"['Adoption', 'Age', 'American', 'Awareness', 'Cancer Control', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complication', 'Costs and Benefits', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Event', 'Florida', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Incidence', 'Incidental Findings', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Professional Organizations', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Smoke', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sputum Cytology Screening', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cancer care', 'care costs', 'care outcomes', 'computable phenotypes', 'computed tomography screening', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'curative treatments', 'data registry', 'deep learning', 'economic evaluation', 'economic outcome', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'innovation', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'lung imaging', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'patient oriented', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repository', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'shared decision making', 'trend']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2021,336323

"Antigen-independent prediction and biomarker identification of cancer-specific T cells Project Summary/Abstract Cancer immunotherapy has achieved remarkable clinical success treating late-stage tumors, yet the response rates remain low and the side effects are often severe. Designing effective immunotherapies relies on accurate identification of tumor-reactive T cells. This is an extremely difficult task because 1) most of the cancer antigens are unknown; 2) the majority of the tumor-infiltrating T cells (TIL) does not recognize cancer cells; and 3) without known antigens, the only approach to acquire such T cells is to perform ex vivo expansion of TILs stimulated by autologous cancer cells, which generates non-specific T cells and is infeasible to many patients. Nonetheless, this strategy is widely adopted in current clinical trials for anti-cancer treatment, despite its reduced therapeutic efficacy and unpredictable side effects of autoimmunity. Therefore, unbiased, antigen- independent identification of tumor-reactive T cells, if possible, will be a major clinical priority as it will significantly increase the efficiency and safety of T cell based immunotherapies. Here we propose to achieve this goal through the development of novel machine learning methods. Such approach has not yet been explored because the fundamental difference between cancer and non-cancer T cells lies in their receptor sequences (TCR), and training data of cancer-specific TCRs is currently unavailable. To prepare for this task, we have developed the software TRUST, to extract the T cell antigen-binding CDR3 regions from bulk tumor RNA-seq data, and the software iSMART to group these CDR3s into antigen-specific clusters. These tools allowed us to develop a new rationale for producing large training sets of tumor-reactive TCRs, even without knowing cancer antigens. In our preliminary analysis, we observed that TCRs from the training data can be matched to tumor antigens that bind to HLA-A*02:01 and elicit immune response in vivo. The cancer-specific CDR3 amino acid sequences also show significantly different biochemical features from non-cancer ones, based on which we further developed software DeepCAT to demonstrate the feasibility of de novo prediction of cancer TCRs. These exciting results highlighted the importance to develop better computational method to track the tumor-reactive T cells for clinical applications. Accordingly, we propose the following Specific Aims: In Aim 1, we will deliver a new machine learning method for accurate classification of tumor-reactive T cells using the CDR3 sequences. In Aim 2, we will derive a set of biomarkers for the cancer-specific T cells for fast and accurate flow sorting of these T cells from TILs. In Aim 3, we will perform single cell sequencing and functional validation of cancer-specific T cells using humanized animal model to validate the predicted genes, and to produce a prioritized list of promising targets for cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy development. These Aims will be accomplished with the great support from the excellent collaborators specialized in cancer immunology at UTSW. Successful completion of this proposal will provide an exciting new paradigm to identify tumor-reactive T cells for precision cancer immunotherapies. Project Narrative Identification of tumor-specific T cells is critical to immunotherapy development, yet remains a challenging task. In this project we will develop a novel machine learning method to study: 1) which T cells in the tumor microenvironment are reactive to malignant cells; 2) what signature genes can be used to track the cancer- specific T cells.

"Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling PROJECT SUMMARY Accurate biomarker-driven prognostic stratification, response prediction, and cohort enrichment are critical for realizing precision treatment strategies and population health management approaches that optimize quality of life and survival for cancer patients. Genomics holds promise for improving classification and prognostication of malignancies, yet oncology practice continues to rely heavily on immunohistochemistry (IHC) as a fundamental tool due to its practicality and ability to provide protein-level and subcellular localization information. The goal of this proposal is to create an open-source software resource for the quantitative analysis of IHC stained tissues and effective integration of IHC, genomic, and clinical features for cancer classification and prognostication. This proposal builds on our collective experience in computer-assisted analysis of microscopic images (including IHC images), development of machine-learning methods to address the challenges of classification and prognostication with heterogeneous and high-dimensional data, and leadership in collection and large-scale analysis of cancer outcomes involving collaboration with multiple medical centers. This effort for the first time will create tools to integrate quantitative IHC imaging, clinical, and genomic information that will in turn enable the research community to explore strategies for the classification of malignancies and prediction of outcomes. The proposed tools will be developed and extensively validated in close collaboration with clinical, genomic, and digital pathology data from the NCI-supported Lymphoma Epidemiology of Outcomes (LEO) cohort study. The software tools produced by this proposal will enable the characterization of subcellular protein expression in cell nuclei, membranes and cytoplasmic compartments. Spatial features of protein expression heterogeneity, along with patient-level summaries of protein expression will be used to develop machine-learning classifiers for cancer subtypes, using diffuse large b-cell lymphomas as a driving application. Technology for automatic tuning of machine learning algorithms will enable a broad class of clinically and biologically motivated users to utilize these tools in their investigations. We will also provide an interactive dashboard that enables users to integrate genomic and IHC-based features to explore prognostic models of patient survival. These tools will be released and documented under an open-source model, integrated with HistomicsTK (https://histomicstk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and available to the broader cancer research community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Classification of a patient’s cancer is critical for personalizing their therapy, and in many cases involves the pathologic examination of tissues treated with multiple immunohistochemical stains. This process is highly subjective, leading to problems with reliable classification and suboptimal treatment and this proposal is focused on developing software tools to improve the reliability of cancer diagnosis and prognosis. These tools will provide a reliable means of interpreting information derived from a practice known as immunohistochemistry to improve the consistency of diagnosis and patient outcomes.",Informatics Tools for Quantitative Digital Pathology Profiling and Integrated Prognostic Modeling,9929565,U01CA220401,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Flowers', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Leadership', 'Letters', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Hodgkin&apos', 's Lymphoma', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'cancer classification', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer survival', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'dashboard', 'data management', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genomic biomarker', 'genomic data', 'health management', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'interactive tool', 'large cell Diffuse non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma', 'learning algorithm', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'microscopic imaging', 'multidimensional data', 'neoplasm resource', 'non-Hodgkin&apos', 's lymphoma patients', 'open source', 'operation', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'patient subsets', 'population health', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'protein expression', 'public health relevance', 'software development', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'whole slide imaging']",NCI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,U01,2021,437968
"Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response PROJECT SUMMARY Despite enormous success in treating several types of cancer, immune checkpoint blocker (ICB) therapy still only shows efficacies in a subset of patients. Identifying novel regulators of immunotherapy response as well as improving the response rate of cancer immunotherapies remain open questions. Recently, we used CRISPR screens in mouse models to investigate T-cell infiltration, proliferation, and killing efficacy, and identified PBAF of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex as one novel regulator of T-cell mediated cytotoxicity. We also developed a computational model, TIDE, to identify gene signatures of CD8 T-cell dysfunction in immune hot tumors and T-cell exclusion in immune cold tumors. The resulting signatures, computed from tumor profiles in non-immunotherapy setting, show promising results in predicting melanoma and lung cancer patient response to immune checkpoint blockade based on pre-treatment tumor expression profiles. This proposed project aims to improve the TIDE biomarkers, identify novel regulators, and elucidate their mechanisms underlying ICB response. In Aim 1, we will develop machine learning approaches on large collection of clinical tumor transcriptome profiles from non-ICB settings to refine the TIDE predictive biomarker of ICB response, and develop a web server to comprehensively evaluate different ICB response biomarkers in all the available ICB cohorts. In Aim 2, we will conduct in vivo CRISPR screens in mouse syngeneic tumor models to identify cancer-cell intrinsic regulators of ICB response, which can serve as novel targets to improve ICB response. In Aim 3, we will elucidate the mechanism underlying two novel regulators of ICB response and characterize their effects on the tumor immune microenvironment using single-cell RNA-seq, single-cell ATAC- seq, and computational modeling. Our investigative team has combined expertise in computational methodology immunotherapy. immunology and big data mining, functional genomics profiling Our proposed studies, if successfully executed, and translational benefits to cancer immunotherapy. and screening, cancer immunology and could provide new insights into cancer PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer immunotherapies have emerged over the last decade as highly promising approaches for cancer treatment, although only subsets of patients respond to immunotherapies. We propose to integrate computational modeling with functional genomics techniques to refine the immunotherapy response biomarkers, identify novel regulators of immunotherapy response, and elucidate their underlying mechanisms, with the potential to improve immunotherapy response.",Regulators of Cancer Immunotherapy Response,10251015,R01CA234018,"['4T1', 'ATAC-seq', 'Antigen Presentation', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'CT26', 'CTLA4 gene', 'Cell-Mediated Cytolysis', 'Cells', 'Chromatin Remodeling Factor', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Exclusion', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hodgkin Disease', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Interferon Type II', 'Knock-out', 'Libraries', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Mediating', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Regulator Genes', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Statistical Models', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'anti-CTLA4', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'epigenomics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'immune checkpoint blockade', 'immune checkpoint blockers', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'melanoma', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predictive marker', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor immunology', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'web server']",NCI,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,604374
"Addressing racial disparities in lung cancer screening PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Screening promotes early detection of cancer to decrease mortality. Unfortunately, significant racial disparities exist in lung cancer screening. Recently published findings by our team show that under current national screening guidelines African Americans have reduced eligibility for lung cancer screening compared to whites. These screening guidelines are based on a combination of age and smoking pack-year criteria derived from a national lung screening trial that was primarily (91%) white. Importantly, smoking behaviors and baseline risks for lung cancer differ greatly between African Americans and whites. Because of this, a risk-based screening strategy may provide a more equitable assessment of eligibility than current screening guidelines. However, the development of personalized risk prediction models for lung cancer in African Americans has been limited. To address this gap and to improve equity in screening eligibility, we propose building a personalized prediction tool using the combined data from three large-scale population-based prospective cohorts with substantial African American representation. The combined cohorts have over 336,000 individuals (44% African American) and 9,132 incident lung cancer cases from across the United States. We propose the following three aims: 1) construct a well-calibrated natural-history model of lung cancer risk for screening in African Americans, 2) evaluate lung cancer screening strategies by simulation and identify sub-populations who would benefit from screening, accounting for comorbidities and false-positives, and 3) develop a web-based decision aid for screening that is culturally appropriate. We will employ innovative machine learning techniques and state-of-the- art statistical methods to build a well-calibrated lung cancer prediction model for African Americans. Careful examination will identify sub-populations (such as women, low socioeconomic status, rural, age groups, etc.) that will benefit from screening. A key innovative aspect of this proposal is its community-engaged approach and partnership with a Community Advisory Board, both of which will help translate our empirical findings into the design of a patient-oriented decision aid. This project is relevant to the mission of the National Cancer Institute since it focuses on establishing equity in lung cancer screening eligibility. Our findings will have sustained impact on precision health and motivate improved clinical strategies for the early detection of lung cancer for African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current eligibility guidelines for lung cancer screening exclude a greater percentage of high-risk African Americans than whites. To remedy this, we will build a lung cancer risk prediction model for African Americans and use the new model to identify racially equitable screening strategies in the US population. Finally, we will produce a web-based tool to aid personalized risk prediction at shared decision-making visits to equitably help African Americans assess whether lung screening is desired.",Addressing racial disparities in lung cancer screening,10210043,R01CA251758,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'African American', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Focus Groups', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Health Interview Survey', 'Natural History', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Preventive service', 'Property', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rural', 'Screening for cancer', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking History', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'age group', 'base', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer risk', 'clinical implementation', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data harmonization', 'design', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'lung cancer screening', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'racial diversity', 'real world application', 'risk prediction model', 'rural area', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'shared decision making', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'study population', 'tool', 'urban area', 'web-based tool']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,658582
"Germline Structural Variant Identification and Functional Determination in Childhood Cancer Abstract A few germline pathogenic structural variants (SV) have been identified in cancer predisposition syndromes, e.g., MSH2 inversion in Lynch syndrome. The advent of short-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has facilitated the detection of SVs. However, a pitfall of this sequencing methodology is the inability to capture all SVs, given the reads do not map well to low complexity regions, and current algorithms used to identify SVs from short-read data have very low sensitivity and very high false-positive rates. One of the objectives of this fellowship is to optimize and implement an SV calling pipeline that utilizes multiple algorithms to increase the sensitivity and specificity of variant identification from germline short-read WGS trios. This pipeline is currently being developed and tested on pediatric cancer patients enrolled in the NIH-funded Baylor Advancing Sequencing into Childhood Cancer Care (BASIC3) exome study, which consists of ethnically and racially diverse pediatric patients with solid (CNS and non-CNS) tumors. This BASIC3 subset includes 63 proband/parent trios who have subsequently undergone germline short-read WGS. Five SV callers are run and then filtered using either a percent reciprocal overlap filter or a proposed Artificial Intelligence-based proximity graph filter to identify de novo and inherited SVs. This cohort has recently been selected for a long-read sequencing pilot, data which serves as the gold standard for SV detection. Comparison of short-read WGS generated SV calls with the long- read data will help determine the sensitivity and specificity of variant calls and further improve the short read pipeline (Aim 1A). Once optimized this short-read WGS SV pipeline will be applied to the Kids First Genetics of Embryonal and Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma cohort (n=900), as an independent assessment of the method and also to identify recurrent germline SVs in this cancer which has not yet been well characterized (Aim 1B). The second training and scientific objective is to explore the functional effect of a novel de novo SV identified through the initial analysis. A de novo germline duplication of the Prostaglandin Reductase 2 (PTGR2) enhancer and promoter region was found in a pediatric Posterior Fossa subtype A (PF–A) ependymoma patient. Transcriptome data from the patient’s tumor revealed increased PTGR2 expression. The PTGR2 protein converts 15-keto- prostaglandin E2 to 15-keto-13,14-dihydro-PGE2. Studies in adult malignancies suggest that increased 15-keto- 13,14-dihydro-PGE2 is associated with cancer risk potentially through the STAT3 signaling pathway. Increased STAT3 signaling is reported as a distinct feature of PF-A ependymoma. The identified partial duplication of PTGR2 will be engineered into ependymoma progenitor cells, to functionally assess the effects on STAT3 signaling, cell proliferation, and DNA synthesis. In parallel, further analysis of PTGR2 expression and structural variants will be analyzed in pediatric ependymoma cohorts (Aim 2). Completion of this experimental plan and described training activities under Drs. Plon and Milosavljevic will provide Owen Hirschi highly interdisciplinary training in analysis of genomic data, structural variation, and the downstream effects on pediatric cancer biology. Project Narrative Structural variation occurring in the germline of pediatric patients is linked to cancer-predisposition, however the tools used to identify these events from short-read whole genome sequencing are often erroneous and limited. This project will seek to optimize a pipeline that can more accurately identify these events and determine the functional effects of one of these identified events. Such studies are essential to accurately determine how often these events occur and whether they play a broader role in pediatric cancers, as well, if these events can influence clinical care and potential cancer prevention.",Germline Structural Variant Identification and Functional Determination in Childhood Cancer,10314873,F31CA265163,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alveolar Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Ependymoma', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Dinoprostone', 'Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'Engineering', 'Enhancers', 'Enrollment', 'Ependymal Cell', 'Ependymoma', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Gold', 'Graph', 'Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Neoplasms', 'Inherited', 'Interleukin-6', 'Link', 'MSH2 gene', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of pancreas', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Neuroglia', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Play', 'Posterior Fossa', 'Predisposition', 'Promoter Regions', 'Prostaglandins', 'Proteins', 'Radial', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma', 'Role', 'Running', 'STAT3 gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Stat3 Signaling Pathway', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Tumor Promoters', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cancer care', 'cancer predisposition', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'ethnic diversity', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'functional gain', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'malignant stomach neoplasm', 'nerve stem cell', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'proband', 'promoter', 'racial diversity', 'stem cells', 't(9', '22)(q34', 'q11)', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'variant detection', 'whole genome']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,F31,2021,43631
"Statistical methods for cancer progression delineation and subtype identification Project Summary  Carcinogenesis is a complex process involving somatic mutations in a number of key biological pathways and processes. Full study of the temporal order of somatic mutation occurrences is very important to understand biological mechanisms of cancer development and to inform new therapeutic targets and treatment options. The first and most recognized example of order of mutations is from colon cancer, which is frequently initiated by mutations that affect the Wnt signaling pathway, and then progress upon subsequent mutations in genes involved in MAPK, PI3K, TGF-beta, and p53 signaling pathways. However, for many other cancer types, temporal orders of mutations are still largely unknown. Somatic mutation profiling via high throughput DNA sequencing has provided an unprecedented opportunity for using statistical/computational methods to study cancer progression. We and others have developed methods to infer temporal order of somatic mutations based on combining mutation profile data from a cohort of patients. However, one major limitation of current methods is that they only consider presence or absence of mutations in a patient’s tumor, but do not take into account intra-tumoral heterogeneity (ITH). The ITH refers to the presence of multiple cell populations, i.e. subclones, with distinct mutation profiles within a patient’s tumor. The ITH, which can be inferred from either single-/multi-region bulk sequencing or single cell sequencing, is usually characterized by a phylogenetic tree with nodes in the tree indicating different subclones and edges indicating the evolutionary relationships of subclones. As a phylogenetic tree describes the temporal order of mutations within an individual patient’s tumor, incorporating such in-depth intra-patient information into the tumor progression analysis across patients is likely to substantially increase the power and accuracy of the analysis. Another important priority in cancer research is to identify molecular subtypes. As cancer is a complex disease, patients of the same cancer type may have very different prognoses and responses to therapy. Further classifying patients into subtypes allows clinicians to better predict a patient’s clinical outcomes and design more personalized treatment strategies. By harnessing omics profiling data, statistical/machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool to identify molecular cancer subtypes. However, due to the high complexity of cancer omics data and limited sample size, it is still challenging to obtain stable and biologically interpretable results. Recently, it has been advocated that incorporating biological knowledge and structure into the construction of statistical/machine learning models is a viable approach to improve the mechanistic interpretability and robustness of the models. To advance current capabilities, we propose to develop new statistical methods to better estimate the temporal order of pathway mutations by integrating ITH, pathway and mutational functional annotation information, and thereby, to classify patients into biologically meaningful subtypes. Project Narrative This project aims to develop new statistical methods to delineate temporal order of pathway mutations during tumorigenesis and identify cancer subtypes with different cancer progression mechanisms. The success of this project will enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms of cancer progression and enable better classification of cancer patients into subtypes, which can potentially impact drug development and clinical practice.",Statistical methods for cancer progression delineation and subtype identification,10201322,R03CA259670,"['Adenocarcinoma Cell', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Appalachian Region', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Cancer Cluster', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'Knowledge', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'MAP Kinase Gene', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'TP53 gene', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta', 'Trees', 'WNT Signaling Pathway', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer classification', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer type', 'carcinogenesis', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'drug development', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'molecular subtypes', 'new therapeutic target', 'p53 Signaling Pathway', 'personalized medicine', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R03,2021,74902
"Single cell quantification of genomic instability in cancer as a determinant of therapeutic response PROJECT ABSTRACT Tumor genetic heterogeneity is an extensive feature of cancer biology and underlies patient response to therapy. One aspect of tumor heterogeneity that has been difficult to study is heterogeneity of large genomic aberrations, including high level amplifications a few megabases in size, whole or partial chromosomal gains and losses and whole genome duplications. This is because identifying these aberrations in subclonal populations (present in <100% of cells) is extremely challenging when sequencing tumors in “bulk”. Single cell genomics however, can resolve these alterations at cellular resolution enabling precise quantification of heterogeneity at these genomic length scales. To comprehensively investigate the extent and consequences of intra-tumor heterogeneity generated by these types of genomic aberrations I will leverage recent advances in robust highly scalable single cell whole genome sequencing and my expertise in computational modeling. In the K99 phase of the award I will investigate how differences in the ability of cells to repair their genomes results in different patterns of genetic heterogeneity, and how such cellular diversity can cause differential response to treatment in high grade serous ovarian cancer, a cancer driven by genomic instability. In the independent phase of the award I will focus on heterogeneity and evolutionary dynamics of extra-chromosomal DNA, small circular pieces of DNA that cause high level amplification of oncogenes. The results of this proposal have the potential to give fundamental new insight into the biology of genomic instability and enable better predication of patient response to therapy and identification of therapeutic vulnerability that may be exploited. This proposal also describes a training plan to advance my career to an independent investigator, combining computational modeling inspired by evolutionary theory, machine learning and high-resolution genomics to quantify cancer evolution in order to better predict patient response to therapy and uncover the mechanisms driving cancer progression. During the K99 phase I will be supported by an interdisciplinary team of experts in single cell genomics, cancer evolution, ovarian cancer biology and genomic instability. I will broaden my knowledge of machine learning, genomic instability and scalable bioinformatics software engineering and improve my communication and leadership skills vital for my transition. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this research proposal we will study how the instability inherent to the genomes of cancer cells impact patient response to therapy. We envisage that the results from this proposal will enable better prediction of patient response to therapy and reveal therapeutic vulnerabilities that may be exploited to design more effective therapies.",Single cell quantification of genomic instability in cancer as a determinant of therapeutic response,10115351,K99CA256508,"['Aftercare', 'Alleles', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Breast Epithelial Cells', 'CCNE1 gene', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromosomal Gain', 'Chromosomal Loss', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Repair', 'DNA Repair Pathway', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genome', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immersion', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oncogenes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Process', 'Property', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance development', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Serous', 'Software Engineering', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'cancer cell', 'cancer genome', 'cancer genomics', 'cancer type', 'career', 'chromosome missegregation', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'extrachromosomal DNA', 'fitness', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic aberrations', 'genotoxicity', 'improved', 'insight', 'mutant', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'patient response', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'repaired', 'response', 'single cell technology', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'tumor progression', 'whole genome']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K99,2021,99798
