"Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers Summary The goal of this project is to develop a smartphone-based wayfinding app designed to help people with visual impairments navigate indoor environments more easily and independently. It harnesses computer vision and smartphone sensors to estimate and track the user’s location in real time relative to a map of the indoor environment, providing audio-based turn-by-turn directions to guide the user to a desired destination. An additional option is to provide audio or tactile alerts to the presence of nearby points of interest in the environment, such as exits, elevators, restrooms and meeting rooms. The app estimates the user’s location by recognizing standard informational signs present in the environment, tracking the user’s trajectory and relating it to a digital map that has been annotated with information about signs and landmarks. Compared with other indoor wayfinding approaches, our computer vision and sensor-based approach has the advantage of requiring neither physical infrastructure to be installed and maintained (such as iBeacons) nor precise prior calibration (such as the spatially referenced radiofrequency signature acquisition process required for Wi-Fi-based systems), which are costly measures that are likely to impede widespread adoption. Our proposed system has the potential to greatly expand opportunities for safe, independent navigation of indoor spaces for people with visual impairments. Towards the end of the grant period, the wayfinding software (including documentation) will be released as free and open source software (FOSS). Health Relevance For people who are blind or visually impaired, a serious barrier to employment, economic self- sufficiency and independence is the ability to navigate independently, efficiently and safely in a variety of environments, including large public spaces such as medical centers, schools and office buildings. The proposed research would result in a new smartphone-based wayfinding app that could greatly increase travel independence for the approximately 10 million Americans with significant vision impairments or blindness.",Leveraging Maps and Computer Vision to Support Indoor Navigation for Blind Travelers,10129965,R01EY029033,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Blindness', 'Calibration', 'Cellular Phone', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cost Measures', 'Destinations', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Economics', 'Elevator', 'Employment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Floor', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Indoor environment', 'Infrastructure', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Needs Assessment', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Research', 'Schools', 'System', 'Systems Integration', 'Tactile', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'blind', 'design', 'digital', 'improved', 'interest', 'lens', 'meetings', 'open source', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'way finding', 'wireless fidelity']",NEI,SMITH-KETTLEWELL EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,403882
"Biomechanical Analysis in Strabismus Surgery We propose 3 interrelated aims to define the biomechanics of the eye rotating (extraocular) muscles (EOMs) & optic nerve (ON) in health & visual disease, understand novel EOM actions, & characterize mechanical effects that may contribute to severe myopia. We aim to improve treatment of strabismus, misalignment of visual directions of the eyes; glaucoma & non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NA-AION), both common blinding ON diseases; & high axial myopia, an ocular elongation & distortion that has become a worldwide epidemic & major cause of blindness. We propose a novel & critical nexus linking the EOMs, ON, & structure of the eye's scleral wall that we will explore using modern imaging & artificial intelligence techniques. Aim I will clarify the kinematic (motion) properties of the human eye, testing by multipositional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the eyeball & EOMs the hypothesis that translational (linear) movement contributes importantly to ocular alignment. MRI will be performed during horizontal convergence & vertical eye rotation in normal people, & in patients who have common forms of strabismus including convergence insufficiency, eye crossing (esotropia), & outward ocular deviation (exotropia), both before & after corrective EOM surgery. Clarification of ocular translation is necessary to understand normal ocular motility and treat its disorders. Aim II will characterize the mechanical loading on the ON caused by eye movements. We will characterize the mechanical effects of ON tractional loading on the eyeball during horizontal & vertical eye rotations at 2 scales in living people, to test the hypothesis that such ON loading deforms it & adjacent retina & blood vessels as loading translates the eye. We propose that the resulting deformation during eye movements may create repetitive strain injury contributing to glaucoma, NA-AION, & axial myopia. In groups of subjects with the foregoing diseases, & in an equal group of matched healthy subjects, we will study mechanical effects of eye movement within the living eye by imaging its internal micro structure & blood vessels with optical coherence tomography, & outside the eyeball in the eye socket using MRI. Effects of tethering during eye movement will be studied ex vivo by precision 3D optical imaging of fresh human eye bank specimens subjected to mechanical tension on the ON that mimic effects of the eye movements imaged in the living subjects. Aim III will model the biomechanics of ocular kinematics. The constitutive mechanical properties of the non-muscular ocular & eye socket tissues will be described by finite element models (FEMs) using modern engineering methods for computational simulation to predict ocular kinematics, as well as local mechanical strains in the ON & sclera that may cause glaucoma, NA-AION, & the ocular deformities underlying extreme nearsightedness. We will determine if FEMs employing normal tissue properties can simulate normal ocular translation during horizontal & vertical rotations & convergence. By FEM simulation, we will also test the hypothesis that ocular loading by eye movement might contribute to: normal vergence, strabismus, & the effects of strabismus surgery. Relevance. Strabismus is a common clinical disorder that can cause double vision in adults and vision loss in children. Strabismus is often treated by surgical manipulation of the eye muscles, although current knowledge of their structure and function is incomplete. Proposed functional imaging and biomechanical studies of the properties of the eye muscles, eyeball, and optic nerve will improve understanding of the causes and treatment of strabismus, optic nerve diseases, and nearsightedness.",Biomechanical Analysis in Strabismus Surgery,10134346,R01EY008313,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accounting', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Biomechanics', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Child', 'Choroid', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Connective Tissue', 'Convergence Insufficiency', 'Cumulative Trauma Disorders', 'Deformity', 'Degenerative Myopia', 'Diplopia', 'Disease', 'Duct (organ) structure', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Equilibrium', 'Esotropia', 'Etiology', 'Exotropia', 'Eye', 'Eye Banks', 'Eye Movements', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gap Junctions', 'Glaucoma', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Matched Group', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Contraction', 'Myopia', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Ocular orbit', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optic Nerve', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patients', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Play', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Property', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Sclera', 'Strabismus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Traction', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'anatomic imaging', 'biomechanical model', 'cell motility', 'crosslink', 'digital imaging', 'ex vivo imaging', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vivo imaging', 'in vivo optical imaging', 'kinematics', 'mechanical load', 'mechanical properties', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'monocular', 'neglect', 'novel', 'ocular imaging', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'orbit muscle', 'predictive modeling', 'quantitative imaging', 'retina blood vessel structure', 'simulation']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,584907
"Neural mechanisms of active vision in the fovea Neural mechanisms of active vision in the fovea In many ways human vision is like a camera, with a lens that forms an image on a spatially arranged sensor (the retina). However, it is unlike a camera because the sensor has uneven sampling and is constantly moving with the eyes. Recent behavioral and theoretical work suggest these eye movements serve a faciliatory role in high acuity vision – where the eye movements are part of the computations and enhance spatial resolution. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms to support this facilitation remain unknown. More broadly, little is known about the neural mechanisms that integrate across the retinal motion generated by eye movements, especially in the central visual field (the fovea). This is particularly important because over 8 million Americans suffer from central vision loss due to retinal disorders. Even if the retinal signals could be repaired, it is imperative to understand how the brain reads out foveal signals to ensure recovery of high-acuity visual processing, and fixational eye movements are a part of that process. The proposed career development plan aims to address these questions by measuring visual processing in the foveal representation of primary visual cortex (V1) during natural visual behavior. This proposal uses custom high-resolution eye-tracking, a novel visual foraging paradigm, largescale neurophysiology, and state-of-the-art machine learning to make these measurements possible. The proposed research will not only generate fundamental understanding of how eye-movements facilitate visual processing, but also will integrate the experimental and theoretical tools required to support neurophysiological studies of active visual processing without a loss of rigor or detail. The candidate has extensive expertise in awake- behaving neurophysiology and computational modeling and the training plan is designed to support his further training in statistical modeling, high-resolution eye-tracking, and modern machine-learning techniques for analyzing neural population data. The primary mentor, Dr. Daniel Butts, is a world expert in statistical models of neural activity during active vision; Co-mentor, Dr. Michele Rucci, is a world leader in high-resolution eye tracking and theoretical approaches to active vision; and Co-mentor, Dr. Jude Mitchell, is a pioneer in establishing the marmoset model of visual neuroscience and an expert in neurophysiology of visual attention. Together, they will provide the guidance to establish the candidate’s transition to a successful independent research career. The goal of this proposal is to identify the impact of fixational eye movements on neural representations in visual cortex in the central visual field. Over 9 million Americans have central vision loss from age-related macular degeneration. Results from this proposal will build a fundamental understanding of how retinal signals from the fovea are processed by visual cortex during natural visual behavior.",Neural mechanisms of active vision in the fovea,10106203,K99EY032179,"['Address', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Callithrix', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Esthesia', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monkeys', 'Motion', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Peripheral', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Role', 'Saccades', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'V1 neuron', 'V4 neuron', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual Fields', 'Visual Pathways', 'Visual attention', 'Work', 'active vision', 'area striata', 'awake', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'central visual field', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'extrastriate', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'flexibility', 'fovea centralis', 'interest', 'lens', 'neural model', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'novel', 'professor', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'repaired', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'sample fixation', 'sensor', 'skills', 'spatial vision', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'tool', 'visual information', 'visual neuroscience', 'visual process', 'visual processing', 'visual tracking']",NEI,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",K99,2021,116969
