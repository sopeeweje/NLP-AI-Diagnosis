"1/2-Testing the impact of early screening on the long-term outcomes of children with ASD Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) impacts almost 2% of children born today, yet very little is known regarding how to positively alter the outcomes of affected children. On the one hand, many, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, believe that early universal screening at well baby check‐ups is an important step towards a positive outcome because it can lead to early treatment. In contrast, the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recently failed to endorse early universal ASD screening, noting that the benefits of doing so are poorly understood. What is needed to inform the debate is to examine the outcomes of a large cohort of children detected very early via universal screening at well‐baby checks, and to compare them to children who did not participate in an early detection program. Here we propose to do just that: We will examine the school age outcomes (age 6‐10 years) of an unprecedented sample size of 242 children with ASD detected very early in San Diego and Phoenix (i.e., “west coast cohort”) through our Get SET Early program, which involved screening with the CSBS at well baby check‐ ups (mean age 17.7 months, range 12‐24 months), and immediate referral for comprehensive evaluation and treatment if warranted. They will then be compared to a cohort of 242 ASD community children matched on age, gender, race, ethnicity, and SES who did not participate in our early detection program (Total N = 484). Given the rarity and uniqueness of our cohort, we plan to characterize outcomes not only on traditional measures of cognition, social behavior, etc., but also on outcome on school achievement (e.g., fully mainstreamed and/or lost their diagnosis) and family functioning (do families experience less stress?). Since the national mean age of ASD diagnosis is around 4 years, we expect that children in the community cohort will have later ages of diagnosis and poorer outcomes than those identified early via the Get SET Early program. With scientific rigor and reproducibility in mind, we will proactively test the replication of findings in an independent cohort (N=103) of toddlers screened in Boston, Philadelphia, and New Haven (i.e., “east coast cohort”) through Project Early and a matched community cohort from the same region (Total N=120). Our specific aims are: AIM 1a: we will identify clinically meaningful outcome subtypes of ASD in our west coast cohort using unbiased network clustering approaches. AIM 1b: with this unique longitudinal cohort, we will examine changes in symptom profile, IQ and adaptive functioning between toddler and school ages. AIM 1c: we will evaluate program impact by comparing the outcomes children in our early‐detected to the community cohort. AIM 1d: we will examine how well findings are replicated in our East coast sample. AIM 2: using complimentary regression and machine learning techniques, with our total sample collapsed across both west and east coast cohorts (N=602), we will test our model that earlier age at identification and treatment leads to improved outcomes. To examine other factors relating to a good outcome, moderating variables such as SES and level of treatment participation will also be included in our models. AIM 3: since state context (e.g., policies, guidelines) could also play a role in outcomes, in we plan to collect key state‐level information to place our findings in context. ASD impacts almost 2% of children, yet factors that positively alter outcomes are uncertain and sharply-debated by the American Academy of Pediatrics that believes early universal screening at well baby check-ups is an important step towards better outcomes, and the United States Preventative Services Task Force that recently failed to endorse early universal screening for ASD. To objectively resolve this impasse, innovative biostatistical and machine learning methods will be used to compare the long-term clinical, educational and family outcomes of two separate cohorts of children initially detected as ASD between ages 12-24 months via universal screening at well-baby checks to outcomes of children with ASD who did not participate in an early detection program. Success of this large and clinically valid first-of-its-kind work will spark more such studies of this vital question, and through that, future pediatric best-practices guidelines for age of detection and treatment of ASD can be properly based on objective evidence and implemented nation-wide.",1/2-Testing the impact of early screening on the long-term outcomes of children with ASD,10120731,R01MH121595,"['Academy', 'Achievement', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Area', 'Arizona', 'Biometry', 'Boston', 'California', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Connecticut', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Characteristics', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Language', 'Laws', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Massachusetts', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pediatrics', 'Pennsylvania', 'Philadelphia', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States', 'Work', 'age effect', 'autism community', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'early screening', 'experience', 'geographic difference', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'screening', 'sex', 'social', 'success', 'tool']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,1290640

"Neural Mechanisms and Developmental Trajectories of ASD and ADHD Project Summary/Abstract Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are common neurodevelopmental disorders which exhibit enormous variability in their developmental trajectories. ASD and ADHD also frequently co-occur, such that ASD is associated with elevated ADHD symptoms and vice versa. Notably, such co-occurring ASD and ADHD symptoms are associated with greater impairment, as well as reduced treatment responsiveness. However, the convergent and divergent neural underpinnings of ASD and ADHD remain poorly understood, impeding the personalization of current treatments and the development of more targeted ones. Furthermore, it is not yet possible to predict how an individual’s symptoms will change over development. Yet, such predictions could be advantageous for treatment planning. The current project will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct neural mechanisms underlying ASD and ADHD, as well as our ability to predict how an individual’s symptoms may evolve over time. Specifically, this study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the functional and structural properties of the brain in ASD and ADHD by comparing the following groups: ASD, ADHD, comorbid ASD+ADHD, and neurotypical controls. Analyses will be completed in both a lifespan sample (ages 5-65; N>2,700) and a pediatric sample (ages 9-10; N>4,900). Functional connectivity will be calculated from resting-state functional MRI scans, structural connectivity from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) scans, and structural morphometry measures from T1-weighted structural MRI scans. This multimodal neuroimaging data will also be used with baseline symptom severity to predict trajectories of ASD, ADHD, and internalizing (e.g., anxious, depressive) symptoms between late childhood (ages 9-11) and early adolescence (ages 11-13) in a longitudinal sample (N>700). Ridge regression analyses conducted within each diagnostic group will reveal whether such brain-based information significantly improves predictive ability compared to symptom severity alone. These analyses will be conducted both within groups defined by traditional diagnostic categories and within transdiagnostic brain-based subgroups to determine the potential utility of such subgroups in increasing predictive accuracy; these subtypes will be created using similarity network fusion on subjects’ multimodal neuroimaging data, followed by spectral clustering. As a whole, this project will allow the applicant to receive extensive training in cutting-edge neuroimaging methods, machine learning approaches (ridge regression and spectral clustering), and conducting translational research. Most importantly, findings from this research will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct mechanisms of ASD and ADHD, which may ultimately lead to more tailored treatments. Furthermore, the proposed research may significantly improve our ability to predict how an individual’s symptoms will change over time. This could have a direct impact on individual treatment planning, as well as the design and implementation of future treatment studies. Project Narrative Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) commonly co-occur and exhibit extraordinarily heterogenous developmental trajectories. This project will improve our understanding of the shared and distinct neural mechanisms of ASD and ADHD, as well as how such brain-based information may improve our ability to predict longitudinal symptom trajectories. This will benefit public health by contributing to the development of more personalized treatments for these disorders, in addition to allowing for improved treatment planning.",Neural Mechanisms and Developmental Trajectories of ASD and ADHD,10290878,F32MH122057,"['11 year old', '13 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child Behavior Checklist', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impairment', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'adolescent with autism spectrum disorder', 'anxious', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic', 'base', 'cognitive development', 'comorbidity', 'course development', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'early adolescence', 'functional MRI scan', 'improved', 'inattention', 'individualized medicine', 'machine learning algorithm', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric symptom', 'personalized medicine', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social cognition', 'symptomatology', 'therapy development', 'trait', 'treatment planning', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,F32,2021,68694
"Objective, MRI biomarkers for pre-symptomatic detection of autism spectrum disorder at 6 months old: commercial software development and optimization Project Summary Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a broad diagnosis for a disorder characterized by symptoms affecting repetitive behavior, social communication, and cognitive ability. 1 in 68 children in the US is affected with ASD (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017) and the likelihood that a child will be affected with ASD is 10 times higher if they have a sibling with ASD. Traditionally, diagnosis occurs most frequently between age 3 to 6 and severe ASD can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. The infant brain is most plastic and susceptible to intervention in the first year of life. As such, there exists an infant population that is either diagnosed too late to receive a more-effective intervention or with a false negative diagnosis, or both. Thus, earlier prediction of the development of ASD can deliver improved likelihood of favorable outcomes. This Fast-Track proposal seeks to develop, standardize, and commercialize software methods and algorithms for neurobehavioral disorder prediction, creating objective biomarkers in a space dominated by subjective neurobehavioral testing and providing a software as a medical device that is a single, integrated, easy-to-use solution for MRI processing, analysis, and syndrome prediction. To create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we will: pull existing, academically vetted methods and software into a commercial design control process (Phase I, SA1); verify the integrated, full-stack solution on a set of IBIS Network data sets stored in the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) and evaluate potential sources of classification error (Phase I, SA2); and conduct an Alpha release to IBIS Network sites for user interface and human factors feedback (Phase I, SA3).We will build the MVP into a commercially viable product as we: expand the utility of the pipeline to accommodate data sets not acquired at IBIS Network sites, optimize manual Quality Control (QC) workflows through semi-automated user interface design, integrate cortical surface area, cortical volume, functional connectivity, and other measurements into a common user interface and workflow, migrate image processing, machine learning, and database infrastructure to cloud-based tools that can scale on-demand, and iterate on the user experience given Alpha feedback (Phase II, SA1); evaluate synthetic data designed to approximate results from multiple MRI scanner types and signal to noise ratio conditions to ensure broad applicability of the software in clinical settings; expand the utility of the machine learning feature analysis and classification to include additional features and evaluate non-binary feature spaces, conduct latent variable analysis to identify one or more scale metrics for ASD prediction; and vet the new metrics through a thorough review of IBIS Network data and comparison with Alpha release results (Phase III, SA2); and develop a data report for clinical use and patient education, conduct a Beta release test across IBIS Network sites and at least one non-IBIS Network site; and perform formal software verification and validation to prepare for broader distribution of the software platform (Phase III, SA3). Narrative MRI technology is rapidly advancing our understanding of how the brain develops in the presence of neurobehavioral disorders like Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This Fast-Track proposal seeks to develop, standardize, and commercialize software methods and algorithms for ASD prediction using structural and functional MRI data acquired on infants, creating objective biomarkers in a space dominated by subjective neurobehavioral testing and providing a software as a medical device that is a single, integrated, easy-to-use solution for MRI processing, analysis, and prediction of syndrome development. This technology will provide first-of-its kind, objective, brain-based biomarkers that will enable development of effective, early interventions and improve the standard of care for infants at high risk of developing ASD.","Objective, MRI biomarkers for pre-symptomatic detection of autism spectrum disorder at 6 months old: commercial software development and optimization",10125199,R44MH118763,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Software Validation', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain morphology', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cognitive ability', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'data standards', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'instrument', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'neurobehavioral disorder', 'neurobehavioral test', 'patient variability', 'repetitive behavior', 'social communication', 'software development', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'verification and validation']",NIMH,"PRIMENEURO, INC.",R44,2021,1088257
"Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY  Functional connectivity in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) has emerged as an important marker of neural abnormalities associated with the disorder. However, despite hundreds of studies on the topic, the specific nature of functional connectivity abnormalities that characterize the disorder remains unresolved and no unifying framework has emerged to describe it. Constructing a consistent model of the functional connectivity abnormalities that underlie ASD is absolutely essential for advancing our understanding of the neural etiology of the disorder. While the commonly accepted model is one where long- range functional connectivity is decreased in ASD while local functional connectivity is increased, many studies have shown increased or normal long-range functional connectivity in ASD and the evidence supporting the hypothesis that local functional connectivity is increased remains scant and indirect.  To date, the vast majority of studies of functional connectivity in ASD have been carried out using fMRI, a technique that relies on the hemodynamic response and thus has a temporal resolution of <1Hz. It is well known, however, that functional connectivity is usually mediated by much faster frequency bands, commonly divided into five fundamental frequency bands: delta (1-2 Hz), theta (3-7 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (31-80 Hz). There is also recent evidence that these frequency bands mediate functional connectivity with preferred directionality. Based on our own preliminary data and current studies, we propose to test the hypothesis that ASD is characterized by increased long-range bottom-up (feedforward) functional connectivity, alongside decreased long-range top-down (feedback ) functional connectivity, and that the gamma and beta frequency bands, respectively, mediate these functional connectivity abnormalities.  Here, we propose to test our hypothesis by obtaining MEG (magnetoencephalography) data from two spatial attention paradigms, visual and auditory, optimized for assessing bottom-up versus top-down functional connectivity, in 50 TD and 60 ASD individuals, ages 14-17. Specifically, we propose the following aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that bottom-up functional connectivity is abnormally increased in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the gamma frequency band. (2) Test the hypothesis that top- down functional connectivity is abnormally reduced in ASD in the auditory and visual domains, and this is manifested primarily in the beta frequency band. (3) Test the hypothesis that neurophysiological functional connectivity measures derived using MEG will be predictive of ASD severity, diagnosis, and behavioral features, using robust correlations, canonical correlations, and machine learning techniques. We expect that the results of this study will lead to a substantially more detailed, comprehensive, and mechanistically motivated framework for the wide range of functional connectivity abnormalities observed in ASD. Project Narrative (Relevance to Public Health) The proposed research will elucidate the neurophysiological underpinnings of specific functional connectivity abnormalities in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with an unprecendent level of detail. It will advance the field by elucidating specific abnormalities, and potentially reconciling over prior disparate results. The outcomes of this study could potentially contribute to treatments designs, and give a neurophysiological picture of connectivity abnormalities detailed enough to advance the field of animal models for ASD.",Testing the Bottom-Up vs Top-Down Imbalance Hypothesis of ASD,10208649,R01MH117998,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Generations', 'Grouping', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Outcome Study', 'Plant Roots', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'feasibility testing', 'hemodynamics', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'millisecond', 'neurophysiology', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'somatosensory', 'temporal measurement', 'therapy design']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,796501
"Reliable prediction of high-risk infants of autism with cortical microstructural biomarker Abstract  The diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is based on behavioral assessments that cannot be confirmed until 2-3 years of age. ASD affects 1 in 59 children in the U.S., and infants from high-risk families have 20 times of risk to develop ASD compared to the general population. Current paradigm misses the precious time window for potential early intervention from birth to 2-3 years of age. Therefore, the focus in ASD research is shifting toward developing early biomarkers which can predict the risk of an infant developing future behavioral abnormalities, while the infant is still in pre- symptomatic stage. Imaging markers play major roles in understanding of both ASD and typical developing (TD) brains. Neural MRI at early infancy may improve the current paradigm for diagnosis for ASD in high-risk infants. Macrostructural measurements such as cortical thickness and surface area from conventional T1 weighted MRI (T1w) have been the primary measurements for characterizing the maturation of infant cortex. However, T1w MRI cannot reveal information about the complex microstructural changes inside the cortical mantle. Cortical microstructure, associated with the underlying cellular and molecular processes, plays a vital role in neuronal circuit formation and emergence of brain functions. We have recently developed a novel protocol to quantify the cortical microstructure using advanced diffusion MRI (dMRI), including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). These advanced dMRI-based cortical microstructural measurements are sensitive imaging markers for the microstructural differentiation that characterizes the infant cortex maturation. We hypothesize that dMRI-based cortical microstructure measurements in early infancy could be potential biomarkers for early detection of ASD in high-risk infants. The goal of this study is to develop and test a novel protocol, using dMRI-based cortical microstructure feature, to reliably predict clinical score of infants at high risk for ASD and other brain disorders in general. We aim: 1) to develop a technique that incorporates dMRI-based cortical microstructural measures at early infancy with cutting-edge multi-kernel machine learning algorithms to reliably predict infants’ future neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age; 2) to demonstrate the initial clinical utility of the technique in infants at high-risk for ASD. To accomplish these goals, we leverage a large cohort of infant study that consists 100 TD infants who longitudinally undergo multi- modal MRI scans at early infancy and neuropsychological testing at 2 years for developing the prediction techniques, and a high-risk ASD study that allows us to longitudinally image the infants during infancy for testing our developed techniques. Finally, it should be emphasized that, although the present project focuses on its clinical applications in infants at high risk for ASD, the method developed also has important utility in detecting behavioral abnormalities in high risk subjects for other brain disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, ADHD), at a time prior to the age of diagnosis. Thus, this technique is expected to have a broad clinical impact. Narrative Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) based cortical microstructural measurements are sensitive markers characterizing infant cortex maturation. The present application aims to develop a technique that incorporates these advanced dMRI-based cortical microstructural measures at early infancy with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to reliably predict infants’ future neurodevelopmental outcomes and clinical scores. This technique is expected to have a range of clinical applications in detecting behavioral abnormality in subjects at high risk for neurodevelopmental disorders, at a time prior to the age of diagnosis.",Reliable prediction of high-risk infants of autism with cortical microstructural biomarker,10218522,R21MH123930,"['2 year old', '3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Broca&apos', 's area', 'Child', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Behavior', 'Language', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Philadelphia', 'Play', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radial', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Severities', 'Surface', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'autism diagnostic observation schedule', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cohort', 'density', 'diffusion anisotropy', 'early detection biomarkers', 'high risk', 'high risk behavior', 'high risk infant', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'infancy', 'kernel methods', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodality', 'neonate', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'regression algorithm', 'relating to nervous system', 'scaffold', 'serial imaging', 'synaptogenesis']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R21,2021,218963
"Gait and communication growth in typical development and autism spectrum disorder Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects approximately 1 in 59 children in the United States1 and incurs substantial public health burden over the lifespan2. Although one of the strongest predictors of later independence for individuals with ASD is early language ability3,4, the mechanisms underlying disrupted language development in ASD are not well understood. Recent research indicates that the transition from crawling to walking represents a sensitive period for language development, during which infants with ASD exhibit atypical trajectories of language growth. For typically-developing (TD) infants, walk onset is closely linked with a sudden increase in infants’ rate of language acquisition5–8 and dramatic changes in how infants perceive and interact with their environment. Emerging evidence indicates that infants with ASD do not exhibit the same “spurt” in language development following walk onset as their TD peers5, but reasons for this difference are not yet known. We propose that gait control, the ability to effectively regulate and coordinate the rhythmic movements needed for walking, is a fundamental mechanism supporting language growth following walk onset that is impaired in infants with ASD. Poor gait control may impede language acquisition after walk onset by making it difficult for children to access the increased communicative learning opportunities that walking affords, including seeing more faces9 and having hands free to gesture10 and share objects with others11,12. Regions of the brain known to support gait and postural control exhibit atypical structure and function in individuals with ASD13,14, and older children and adults with ASD exhibit poorer gait control15–17, indicating that gait control may be fundamentally disrupted in ASD. However, no studies to date have prospectively assessed early gait control in infants with ASD. The goal of the proposed research is to investigate gait control as a potential mechanism linking ASD to change in the rate of language growth after walk onset. This study will test whether gait control 4 weeks after walk onset (measured by a pressure- sensitive gait mat) predicts change in the rate of language growth following walk onset in infants at high and low familial risk for ASD (Aim 1). Next, we will examine whether ASD symptoms at 24 months are associated with gait control after walk onset (Aim 2). Finally, the proposed study will also explore whether innovative computer vision technology can provide an infant gait assessment tool that is more scalable to settings outside the lab than current gold-standard pressure-sensitive gait mats (Aim 3). This study will be the first to explicitly test the relationships between gait control, language development, and ASD symptoms. In so doing, it will yield a deeper understanding of the link between early motor and language development during this sensitive period, with the potential to identify possible targets for early intervention to promote improved language outcomes in infants with ASD. Taken together, this project and the accompanying training plan will prepare the applicant for a research career investigating the early motor and social communication development in ASD. Project Narrative Learning to walk is associated with a significant increase in the rate of language development for typically- developing infants, but not for infants who go on to receive a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). While the reasons for this difference remain unclear, previous research indicates that children and adults with ASD are impaired in their ability to control the gross motor movements involved in walking, which may impede their ability to take advantage of the increased communicative learning opportunities that walking affords. By (1) prospectively testing the relationship between early gait control, language development, and ASD symptoms, and (2) developing a scalable computer vision tool for the automatic assessment of infant gait, the proposed study will investigate gait control as a potential mechanism contributing to disrupted language growth in ASD and make it possible to identify and study early gait impairment on an unprecedented scale.",Gait and communication growth in typical development and autism spectrum disorder,10199744,F31MH123033,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Assessment tool', 'Brain region', 'Calendar', 'Child', 'Child Language', 'Chiroptera', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Life', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Periodicity', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Vocabulary', 'Walking', 'Width', 'adult with autism spectrum disorder', 'autism diagnostic observation schedule', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'career', 'dimensional analysis', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'innovation', 'language onset', 'language outcome', 'peer', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'recruit', 'skills', 'social communication', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,48536
"The Autistic Brain Over 45: The Anatomic, Functional, and Cognitive Phenotype Project Summary Extremely little is known about neural and cognitive changes or long-term prognosis for adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) older than 50 years of age, although in the US alone hundreds of thousands of people with ASD will reach this age group in the coming decades. Cross-sectional findings suggest that new cognitive, sensorimotor, and mental health problems emerge and that accelerated brain tissue loss occurs. Functional and structural brain connectivity is also affected, as shown with resting state functional MRI and diffusion MRI.  This project aims to characterize mid- to late-life trajectories of brain anatomy and function in ASD, as well as cognitive and behavioral change, and identify risk factors that predict poor outcomes including suspected effects of declining GABA concentrations and excitatory:inhibitory imbalance in aging. The proposed renewal will leverage an existing cohort (Cohort 1) of 40-70 year olds with ASD and matched typical comparison (TC) participants. In addition, a new cohort (Cohort 2) of 50 individuals with ASD and 70 TC participants age 40-70 will be recruited. Both cohorts will be followed longitudinally, with data collection every 3.5-5 years. Extensive data will be acquired at each time-point, including multimodal MRI scans, measures of GABA concentration from MR spectroscopy, diagnostic, cognitive, and behavioral assessments, as well as medical and personal history information.  The project will pursue 3 specific aims. Aims 1 will identify alterations (and altered rates of change) in brain anatomy, function, and connectivity and relate these to behavioral changes in 3 suspected risk domains of Motor, Executive, and Affective function. Aim 2 will test for group differences and effects of age in GABA concentrations and in network integration and segregation. Aim 3 will identify behavioral and neural risk factors of adverse (or positive) outcomes (e.g. on scales of maladaptive behavior, loss of daily living skills) using machine learning, and identify ASD subgroups based on GABA levels, differential rates of change, or differential domain-specificity. Project Narrative This project will generate extensive evidence on links between brain changes and behavior in adults with autism spectrum disorders between 40 and 70 years of age, for whom relevant data are extremely limited. Some specific focus will be on neuronal excitation:inhibition balance, which changes in aging. This systematic body of evidence will provide crucial information in the quest for predictors of long-term neurocognitive success or decline in ASD, thus serving as a first step to developing interventions to protect against such decline.","The Autistic Brain Over 45: The Anatomic, Functional, and Cognitive Phenotype",10299529,R01MH103494,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Down-Regulation', 'Elderly', 'Equilibrium', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glutamates', 'Impairment', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'adult with autism spectrum disorder', 'adverse outcome', 'age effect', 'age group', 'age related', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive testing', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'early onset', 'follow-up', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'insight', 'middle age', 'multimodality', 'outcome forecast', 'prospective', 'rate of change', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segregation', 'skills', 'social', 'success', 'young adult']",NIMH,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,743961
"Novel Approaches to Infant Screening for ASD in Pediatric Primary Care ABSTRACT – Novel Approaches to Infant Screening for ASD in Pediatric Primary Care  The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate novel tools to identify risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infants 6-12 months of age in a pediatric primary care setting. Research has confirmed that ASD is associated with changes in brain and behavior that are evident during infancy, and proof-of-concept studies suggest that early intervention during the infant period can improve early brain function and developmental outcomes. Moreover, early universal autism screening has been shown to reduce existing disparities based on socioeconomic status (SES) and ethnicity/race in access to early diagnosis and treatment. This project leverages ongoing work that is currently funded as part of the Duke NIH Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) Award (NICHD P50 HD093074; Dawson, Center Director), which is evaluating a novel digital phenotyping tool for early ASD risk assessment in toddler-age children in a pediatric primary care setting. Our novel screening tool, SenseToKnow, is based on active closed-loop sensing, where children are shown brief, developmentally-appropriate, dynamic stimuli on a smart tablet or smartphone, while the sensors in the same device capture information for automatic, objective quantification of several behavioral risk markers, based on patterns of attention, orienting, affect, vocalizations, and motor behavior. The proposed research will 1) evaluate a novel infant version of the app, SenseToKnow-Infant, in a large population of infants in the context of routine pediatric care, and 2) examine the utility of a multi- modal approach to risk assessment that combines information from SenseToKnow-I with information from infant and maternal electronic health records (EHRs). Using both direct digital behavioral measurement via SenseToKnow-I and data readily available in the EHR, we aim to develop and validate a multimodal ASD risk assessment algorithm for use in infants (6-12 months of age) that can be deployed in the general population. RELEVANCE STATEMENT – Novel Approaches to Infant Screening for ASD in Pediatric Primary Care The overall goal of this project is to develop and validate novel tools to identify risk for autism spectrum disorder in infants 6-12 months of age in a pediatric primary care setting.

"The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes SUMMARY The global burden of mental illness, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), intellectual disability, epilepsy, Tourette disorder, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, is enormous, whether measured in health care expenditures, lost productivity, or personal suffering. Unfortunately, there is a striking lack of insight into the underlying molecular biology of these syndromes. However, recent advances in gene discovery are setting the stage for a transformation in the understanding of these psychiatric disorders. Understanding pathobiology and developing novel treatments is becoming increasingly dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types, including physical interactions among proteins and synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among genes. Here we seek support for a new effort, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu), aimed at comprehensively understanding these complex interactions in psychiatric disorders and how they differ between diseased and healthy states. While we will focus on ASD in this proposal, this work will establish a paradigm to investigate other psychiatric disorders in future work. The PCMI is a multi­campus initiative of the University of California, involving UC San Francisco, UC San Diego and UC Berkeley, which leverages genomics, proteomics, high­throughput sequencing, advanced network mapping, computational analysis, and research platforms developed by multiple PCMI investigators over the past decade. Thus primed, these platforms will be tuned to efficiently generate, assemble, and analyze molecular networks linked to ASD, in relevant cell types, with a view towards pathway and network­based personalized therapy. Specifically, over the next five years the PCMI will seek to catalyze major phase transitions in ASD research and therapy by (1) Comprehensively mapping the networks of physical interactions among proteins linked to ASD, revealing the protein complexes and higher­order molecular units underlying ASD in multiple cell types of the human brain; (2) Mapping the parallel networks of synthetic­lethal and epistatic interactions among ASD genes using CRISPR­based approaches; (3) Establishing the robust computational methodology, end­user software, and databases for assembly and use of ASD cell network maps in both basic and clinical modalities; (4) Translating molecular insights into an understanding of higher order phenotypes; (5) Building a critical mass of leading investigators focused on psychiatric disorders worldwide to expand PCMI into a global coordinated partnership; and (6) Training the current and next­generation of scientists in Network Biology and its applications to research focused on psychiatric disorders. NARRATIVE Although the past few years have ushered in much success in identifying the genes linked to autism spectrum disorders (ASD), we need to move beyond simply cataloguing component genes in order to gain a mechanistic and actionable understanding of ASD and other psychiatric disorders. More specifically, it is critical to understand the many interactions between these genes and the proteins they encode, and how these complex networks are connected to the underlying pathobiology of ASD. To address this challenge, the Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative (PCMI, www.pcmi.ucsf.edu) will apply systematic approaches to comprehensively map the molecular networks that underlie ASD and translate them to higher order biological insights, which will form a key resource for precision medicine.","The Psychiatric Cell Map Initiative: Connecting Genomics, Subcellular Networks, and Higher Order Phenotypes",10208658,U01MH115747,"['ASCL1 gene', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'CRISPR interference', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'California', 'Cataloging', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Future', 'Gene Combinations', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Ontology', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase Transition', 'Phenotype', 'Point Mutation', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Xenopus', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cell type', 'deep neural network', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'gene discovery', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'interest', 'link protein', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'rare variant', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'small molecule', 'success', 'transcriptome']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2021,4247206
"Functional brain developments during movie watching and resting-state in autism spectrum disorder Project summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is usually diagnosed early in childhood. Understanding the developmental curves of brain functions in typically developing children and children with ASD will help to understand the brain correlates of ASD. In this project, we will analyze functional MRI (fMRI) data of more than 1,000 children and adults to portrait brain developmental curves. FMRI has been commonly used to study brain functions in action. Usually, participants are asked to do some strictly designed tasks on a computer, or simply lay in the scanner without thinking a thing in particular. A more natural way to perform scanning has been proposed, where the participants are asked to watch short movie clips during the scanning. However, data analysis for movie watching data becomes complicated. We have developed a novel method to examine functional communications between brain regions during movie watching. In this project, we will compare our new method with existing methods. The project is divided into two parts. In the first part, we will study brain developments in hundreds of typically developing children. We will compare data from movie watching and resting-state, and compare different analysis methods. The results will help us find better methods to chart the developing brain. In the second part, we will compare the developing curves between individuals with ASD and those in typically developing individuals. The data may help us to establish a better way to scan individuals of ASD, and a better way to characterize brain functions in ASD. Public health relevance Brain imaging examinations of individuals with autism spectrum disorder is challenging for both practical and theoretical reasons. This study proposes a method to study the communications between brain regions during a naturalistic movie watching condition. The method can help to understand brain communications in individuals with autism spectrum disorder, and to portrait growth charts of brain functions.",Functional brain developments during movie watching and resting-state in autism spectrum disorder,10291842,R15MH125332,"['21 year old', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clip', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Portraits', 'Predictive Value', 'Psyche structure', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Slide', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thinking', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavioral outcome', 'design', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'mental disorder diagnosis', 'mental state', 'movie', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'theories', 'trend']",NIMH,NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R15,2021,305061
"Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder A major impediment to early identification and intervention for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is our limited understanding of how different children present signs as toddlers, including what risk symptoms coincide across multiple dimensions to predict outcome. Our objectives are to quantify behavioral and brain connectivity based subtypes of risk that model the variability of ASD symptom expression in a community sample of toddlers. We will then test the predictive validity of this approach in the same cohort of children at three years of age in order to identify risk profiles that differentially predict later cognitive, behavioral, and clinical features. First, we will implement two unsupervised data-driven computational approaches in a community sample of 3000 children between 18-24 months old in order to characterize clusters of risk profiles. We hypothesize that each approach will identify a proportion of high-risk individuals consistent with epidemiological estimates of ASD and associated developmental disabilities (e.g., language or global DD). Based on our preliminary data, we anticipate that ~300 children will be identified by these data-driven risk-profiling methods. We also hypothesize that distinct patterns of structural and functional connectivity will distinguish groups of at-risk children and that these groups will differ from low-risk children. All children will be scanned with the same brain imaging sequences and procedures implemented in the Baby Connectome Project and will be compared to data from 100 low-risk children from that project. Our neuroimaging sample of 300 children will be reassessed at age three with direct clinical assessment using gold-standard diagnostic instruments as well as parent report. This will allow us to validate the risk profiling approach implemented at 18-24 months, to compare with a current screening approach, and to refine the risk profiling approach with supervised training of prediction algorithms that incorporates behavioral/clinical outcome data. We expect this method for risk stratification/subtyping to better model the heterogeneity inherent to the early at-risk and resilient phenotypes, which will subsequently improve early identification/diagnosis efforts. These outcomes will have translational impact because improved methods for early identification in ASD are necessary for the successful development of efficacious, personalized early interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Symptoms of autism present differently in toddlers, which makes it difficult to identify children at risk during their first two years of life. Our goal is to measure variation in behavior and brain functioning in this age that may predict differing clinical outcomes. Identifying different subtypes of risk will later help us develop individually-optimized clinical recommendations for children with autism and related disorders.",Parsing early emerging heterogeneity related to autism spectrum disorder,10101678,R01MH115046,"['3 year old', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Life', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'case control', 'case-based', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'communication behavior', 'connectome', 'design', 'early screening', 'follow up assessment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning algorithm', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'repetitive behavior', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'social communication', 'symptomatology', 'translational impact', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,743237
"Novel Computational Analysis of Prosody in ASD and the Broad Autism Phenotype Abstract  Pragmatic (i.e., social) language impairments are a core feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and differences have also been observed more subtly in the Broad Autism Phenotype (BAP; a cluster of subclinical features related to ASD, which are believed to reflect genetic liability in clinically unaffected relatives). Prosody is a central component of pragmatics, which includes aspects of speech and language that modulate and enhance meaning at grammatical, pragmatic, and affective levels including stress and intonation, which are conveyed by changes in fundamental frequency, intensity, and rate. Atypical prosody in ASD has been identified as the most prominent feature that immediately identifies an individual with ASD as “odd” compared to typically developing peers, causing significant obstacles to social interaction and integration1-3. More subtle differences in prosody have also been observed among parents of individuals with ASD, and may serve as a key marker of ASD genetic risk, measurable in affected and unaffected individuals. Because speech samples may be easily obtained, identification of key prosodic profiles in ASD and profiles reflecting genetic liability to ASD, could have widespread implication as a biomarker for detection of ASD risk, and as a tool for assessment and interventions focused on this clinically significant feature of ASD. Limitations in current work pose significant barriers to the objective and efficient characterization of prosody, where current methods typically rely on subjective perceptual ratings which, though clinically valid, are difficult to obtain and apply objectively in treatment contexts, and are unfeasible for application with large samples. Moreover, without extensive training, perceptual rating methods are not adequately sensitive for capturing important variation and heterogeneity in ASD prosodic profiles, or identifying the often quite subtle yet biologically meaningful prosodic differences that may be observed in clinically unaffected relatives. These factors together impose substantial barriers to reproducibility, limit scalability, and render prosodic characterization unfeasible for use by clinicians. This project attempts to address these challenges by applying sophisticated computational modeling of extensive existing speech and language samples collected through a larger companion project (R01DC010191, PI: Losh), to characterize prosodic profiles in ASD and in parents. In Preliminary Data, we demonstrate evidence of distinct prosodic profiles of individuals with ASD and parents, along with relationships to broader pragmatic language abilities and neural processing of speech sounds in ASD and parents, supporting the goals of this project to apply sophisticated computational tools to speech data obtained across multiple contexts in order to 1) identify prosodic profiles that characterize ASD and the BAP in parents, and 2) examine how prosodic profiles relate to broader clinical-behavioral phenotypes, and aggregate within families, potentially contributing phenotypic signatures of clinically and etiologically more homogeneous subgroups. Project Narrative Difficulty with the social use of language, including impairments in the rhythmic and intonational features of language used to convey intention and emotions that are essential for establishing connections with social partners, is a hallmark of ASD. Subtle differences in these language features have been observed among clinically unaffected relatives as well, and might serve as subclinical markers of genetic risk to ASD. This project aims to provide clinically and biologically meaningful measures of such language differences, using state-of-the- art computational modeling of social language characteristics in ASD, to inform clinical assessment, treatment, and biological studies of ASD.",Novel Computational Analysis of Prosody in ASD and the Broad Autism Phenotype,10113580,R03DC018644,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Companions', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Family Study', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Disorders', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Social Interaction', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'brain behavior', 'clinically significant', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'language impairment', 'novel', 'peer', 'predictive marker', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'speech processing', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,74639
"Stratifying the Heterogeneity of Autism Spectrum Disorder: Impact of Co-Occurring Anxiety and ADHD ABSTRACT The substantial heterogeneity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a key barrier in early diagnosis and in developing and evaluating effective treatments for the disorder. Although early behavioral intervention targeting social, cognitive, and adaptive functioning improves outcomes for many children with ASD, there is significant variability in treatment response within studies. Given this variation, stratifying the heterogeneity of ASD is essential for identifying biomarkers to help providers systematically diagnose, tailor treatment, and monitor response. The proposed project responds to this critical need by elucidating the impact of a potential key source of this heterogeneity: co-occurring anxiety and ADHD. Little is known about the unique and additive impacts of co-occurring anxiety and ADHD on individuals with autism in the early childhood period. Furthermore, the impact of these co-occurring disorders on commonly used neural and behavioral biomarkers remains a gap in the current literature. To fill these gaps in the literature, we propose a multimodal approach, using a combination of parent reports, observational assessments, and neurophysiological assays, to carefully phenotype samples of young children from 4 groups: ASD alone, ASD+Anxiety, ASD+ADHD, and ASD+Anxiety+ADHD. Our central hypothesis is that co-occurring anxiety or ADHD will have both unique and additive effects on the clinical presentation, executive functioning, and biomarker signatures of young children with ASD. To test this hypothesis, we have three aims: (1) Differentiate the impact of co-occurring anxiety or ADHD on core and associated symptoms in young children with ASD. (2) Identify the relationship between co-occurring anxiety or ADHD and executive function deficits in young children with ASD. (3) Determine the relationship between co-occurring anxiety or ADHD and neural, attentional, and behavioral biomarkers being used to characterize and monitor treatments in ASD. If successful, this project will provide a better understanding of the impact of co-occurring ADHD and anxiety on the clinical presentation, functional outcomes, and neurobiology of ASD. This in turn will improve our ability to stratify young children with ASD into meaningful subgroups. This knowledge will support development of effective and biologically informed methods for early detection and treatment, which can mitigate the negative effects of co-occurring ADHD and anxiety on long-term outcomes of individuals with ASD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The substantial variability in the presentation of autism (ASD) is a key barrier in early diagnosis and in developing and evaluating effective treatments for the disorder. Because of this, the NIH and the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee (IACC) have pushed to better understand the causes and impacts of this variability in individuals with ASD.

"Using complex video stimuli to elucidate atypical brain functioning in ASD ABSTRACT A major gap in our understanding of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is in knowing how the brain functions during conditions that approximate the complex processing demands of the real world. Instead, almost everything we know about brain functioning in ASD comes from reductionist studies that often use highly simpliﬁed stimuli and isolated task demands, or even from studies that lack a stimulus or task altogether, as in the case of resting-state functional connectivity. Yet, successful processing “in the wild” (i.e., in the real world) relies on the simultaneous engagement and seamless integration of multiple brain regions, brain networks, and cognitive processes. Understanding how these neural systems behave and interact during real-time processing of complex and dynamic stimuli, therefore, is critical for understanding how real-world behavior and cognition emerge from brain activity, and this remains a major gap in our understanding of ASD. The purpose of the current proposal is to ﬁll this gap, by using complex video stimuli that sample broadly from the natural world and engage multiple diverse perceptual and cognitive systems simultaneously, thus evoking activity across the entire brain at once. From this data, rich high-dimensional measures can be generated and used in combination with multivariate analytic methods ideally-suited to detect idiosyncratic and heterogeneous patterns of neural responding, which can then be related back to phenotypic variability across individuals. Our proposed studies will take place over 5 years and include 4 speciﬁc aims. In the ﬁrst two aims, we will identify neural systems most affected in ASD during the presentation of a complex video stimulus, parse the heterogeneity at the neural level using data-driven approaches and relate it back to heterogeneity at the behavioral level, and explore the stimulus dimensions (social and non-social alike, both sampled broadly) that underlie these neural abnormalities. In a third aim, we will examine video-evoked functional connectivity both within and across brain networks, comparing this directly against resting-state connectivity, and examining both modes of functional connectivity across various timescales (including dynamic coupling). A ﬁnal exploratory aim will assess the short-term and long-term stability of these measures, as well as their sensitivity in tracking change following experimental perturbation—important characteristics for potential biomarkers and/or predictor and outcome measures for use in intervention studies. Altogether, this work will provide new insight into brain activity and brain connectivity during conditions that more closely reﬂect processing demands of the natural world, help to link individual differences in brain functioning with individual differences in behavior (i.e., heterogeneity), and assess whether these neural measures may be viable candidates as biomarkers for use in future studies. This proposal addresses the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee's Strategic Plan (2013 Update) that includes comprehensive examination of the neural circuitry in individuals with ASD across the lifespan, including throughout adulthood, as well as a focus on heterogeneity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is an alarmingly common neurodevelopmental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population, making it a major public health concern.

"A Big Data Approach Toward the Development of a New Quantitative Measure of Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors Project Summary Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB) are a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and also occur across a range of other neurodevelopmental disorders. RRB present a major barrier to learning and adaptation, interfere with family functioning and present a source of considerable stress for parents. Despite their clinical significance, underlying mechanisms behind this complex behavioral domain are poorly understood and effective, targeted, individually tailored treatment options are currently lacking. One of the major barriers to moving the RRB research agenda forward has been the lack of clarity around the structure and conceptualization of RRB and the limitations of the currently available measures, particularly in terms of their (i) inability to comprehensively capture the full range of RRB and (ii) lack of sensitivity to treatment-related change. Therefore, the overarching aim of this project is to develop a parent report measure for comprehensive and quantitative RRB assessment applicable across clinical populations and across the life- span and useful in both etiological- and treatment-related research. In order to achieve this goal, we will first conduct advanced statistical analyses of multiple, large, high-quality datasets containing a range of currently available measures in order to achieve fine-grained differentiation between distinct RRB domains (Specific Aim 1) and to identify domains not adequately captured by the current measures (Specific Aim 2). The implementation of this initial phase of the project will ensure that robustness and generalizability of the factor structures for each individual measure across age, developmental level, gender, and diagnostic status, is established and that generalizable core RRB structure across the currently available RRB instruments is identified. Neither of these two different aspects have been comprehensively addressed before. Robust derived RRB factor structure, together with the identification of potential RRB domains that might be under- represented and not adequately depicted by the current instruments, together with the systematic review of the literature will inform the development of items of the new scale to capture the full range of RRB. The pilot version of the new scale will be psychometrically evaluated online within a large sample of children and adolescents with ASD (Specific Aim 3). This project will lay the foundation for future investigations aimed at further refinement of the newly developed informant-based scale and the development of a clinician interview and objective instrument, as well as their validation across ASD ansd neurodevelopmental disorders, and the testing of their utility as a clinical outcome measure. Project Narrative Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRB), a core feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), present a major barrier to learning and adaptation, and a source of stress and management challenges for families. In addition to utilizing existing large datasets to clarify the structure of RRB and develop comprehensive RRB taxonomy, this project will utilize the information gained from the innovative secondary data analysis to develop and pilot a newly developed comprehensive and sensitive RRB scale. This project will pave the way for new studies that will aim to further validate the new measure, explore its sensitivity to change and utility as an outcome in clinical trials and inform the development of new clinical observation and objective measurement tools.",A Big Data Approach Toward the Development of a New Quantitative Measure of Restricted and Repetitive Behaviors,10066368,R21MH121876,"['Address', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Ensure', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Factor Analysis', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Validation', 'adolescent with autism spectrum disorder', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral construct', 'clinical outcome measures', 'clinically significant', 'compulsion', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'informant', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'motor behavior', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'social', 'stress management', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,197125
"Developmental methylomics of autism spectrum disorder Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects ~1% of the population. Progress has been made in elucidating the genetics of ASD through large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and whole-exome sequencing (WES) studies that have identified several loci associated with ASD. However, a substantial fraction of ASD status cannot be explained by genetic sequence variation. There are multiple reasons to expect that DNA methylation (DNAm) may account for part of this unexplained variation. First, part of the ASD-related genes identified via DNA sequence variation include genes involved in chromatin modification and DNAm. Second, ASD likely originates during prenatal development, a period of dynamically regulated changes in DNAm in the brain. As this remodeling may result in epimutations that can dysregulate brain function, disruption of the DNAm regulation in utero represents a plausible ASD risk mechanism. Third, ASD is associated with several neonatal and other environmental risk factors. Because DNAm can be modified by environmental factors, it may mediate the effect of these risk factors on ASD.  The overall aims of this project is to enhance our understanding of DNAm in ASD etiology, and use DNAm marks at for early detection of individuals at risk for ASD. For this purpose we will generate methylome-wide data using samples from ASD cases age 18-25 years and matched controls from an existing Swedish case- control study called Population-based Autism Genetics and Environment Study. In addition, we will use stored neonatal blood samples to generate a second methylation profile for these same individuals at birth. Thus, we will have methylome-wide data from blood for two time-points from all participants, accompanied by longitudinal phenotype information spanning birth to current date obtained from the Swedish registers.  We will use a sequencing-based approach to assay the DNAm status of nearly all 28 million common CpG sites in the human genome and will perform a battery of novel statistical analyses including methylome-wide association studies (MWAS) of whole blood and individual cell-types in blood; analyses integrating DNAm information with neonatal risk factors and already existing GWAS and WES data; and studies exploring the role of DNAm in the ASD sex-bias. Significant findings will be replicated in four existing and independent blood sample collections, and studied in the newly generated methylation/expression data from ASD brain samples. Finally, we propose to use neonatal DNAm markers to create multi-marker methylation risk scores (MRSs) for predicting ASD risk. Although, there has been ample progress in identifying genetic risk factors for autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a substantial fraction of ASD status cannot be explained by genetic sequence variation. DNA methylation (DNAm) may account for part of this unexplained variation and, therefore, we proposed to perform methylome- wide investigations using sequencing-based DNAm data and novel statistical approaches. The successful completion of this project means that we have identified ASD associated methylation marks that will enhance our understanding of the ASD etiology and may be used for risk prediction and early diagnosis of ASD.",Developmental methylomics of autism spectrum disorder,10098730,R01MH124981,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Autopsy', 'Binding', 'Bioconductor', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Complement', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Methylation Regulation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA analysis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equation', 'Etiology', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Sex Bias', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Whole Blood', 'X Chromosome', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'cell type', 'chromatin modification', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'factor A', 'follow-up', 'genetic information', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic epidemiology', 'improved', 'in utero', 'methylation biomarker', 'methylome', 'methylomics', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'population based', 'prenatal', 'risk prediction', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'young adult']",NIMH,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,764339
"Sex-Specific Brain and Behavioral Predictors of Cognitive Aging in Middle-Aged Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder Project Summary/Abstract Research Project Long-Term Objective: The long-term objective of this research is to describe the cognitive challenges associated with aging in adults with ASD to inform interventions and care plans. Aim 1: Identify the combination of sex-specific functional and structural brain measures in adults with ASD that (a) best describe age-related cognitive changes compared to matched-NT controls and (b) predict age-related cognitive decline. Methods: We will use multi-modal partial least squared analysis to elucidate information linkage between complementary neuroimaging data sets. Research Design: We will analyze both cross-sectional data of young-adult (n=100) vs. middle-aged (n=120) ASD and NT groups, and longitudinal data of middle-aged adults in two year increments (n=120 participants; 360 data sets). Men and women will be similarly represented in groups (M:F ratio, 1.0 : 0.7). Aim 2: Identify the combination of behavioral measures in adults with ASD that best predict age-related cognitive decline. Methods: We will use multi-task learning to determine the linkage between complementary behavioral data sets. Research Design: We will analyze cross-sectional and longitudinal data from Aim 1 ASD participants. Health Relatedness: These aims will have a substantial positive impact on health care quality and costs in the ASD community by vertically advancing our understanding of the unique cognitive and brain aging process, and laying the groundwork for delivering effective, precision medicine care to the growing and vulnerable population of older adults with ASD.

"Novel video-based approaches for detection of autism risk in the first year of life Signs of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) emerge in the first year of life in many children, but diagnosis is typically made much later, at an average age of 4 years in the United States. Early intervention is highly effective for young children with ASD, but is typically reserved for children with a formal diagnosis, making accurate identification as early as possible imperative. A screening tool that could identify ASD risk during infancy offers the opportunity for intervention before the full set of symptoms is present. In this application, we propose two novel video-based methods of detecting ASD in the first year of life. First, we will validate a recently developed instrument, the Video-referenced Infant Rating System for Autism (VIRSA), in a general community sample of infants. The VIRSA is a brief web-based instrument that utilizes video depictions rather than written descriptions of behavior to detect signs of ASD. It leverages thousands of hours of already collected and hand-coded video obtained through previous NIH funding. Videos demonstrating a continuum of behaviors and developmental competence are presented to parents, who identify the ones most representative of their child. Through previous funding, we have established that the VIRSA has good psychometric properties when used by parents with previous experience of ASD (i.e., have an older affected child) and demonstrated that it is able to distinguish infants developing ASD in the first year of life. In Aim 1, we will examine the measure’s use by parents who are naïve to ASD, with no family history of the disorder. In Aim 2, we propose another innovative method of utilizing video for ASD detection. Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence in which computer programs “learn” and adjust themselves in response to training data to which they are exposed, improving performance and generalization to novel data without being explicitly programmed. We propose to use the videos from the VIRSA, previously demonstrated in our initial validation study to be sensitive to early signs of ASD, as training inputs to develop machine-learning algorithms for automatic detection of ASD-related behaviors. The huge video archive available for this project, with hand- coded time-stamped behavioral tags, is a highly valuable resource for machine learning. Aim 2 will lay the foundation for future attempts to develop video-based mobile applications for ASD recognition, which require validated classifiers that can recognize behavioral events central to early detection of ASD. The ultimate goal of the two aims of the proposed project is to develop low-cost, low-burden measures that capitalize on new technologies, including mobile platforms, video, and machine learning methods, to detect ASD risk in infancy. Such measures would have significant public health applications, including screening large community-based samples and longitudinally tracking development in pediatric settings to identify children requiring evaluation. Identification of ASD in infancy would afford treatment at an optimal age, when the brain is most malleable, which could lessen disability and possibly prevent the emergence of later-appearing symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Symptoms of autism spectrum disorder emerge in infancy, yet the average age of diagnosis in the United States is still 4 years. In this application, we propose to develop two novel video-based methods of detecting risk for ASD in the first year of life, harnessing new technologies and automated approaches that pose low burden to families.

"Predicting Autism and Social Functioning from Computer Vision Analyses of Motor Synchrony During Dyadic Interactions PROJECT SUMMARY Our innovative and fully automated approach to the analysis of social behavior addresses the pressing need for precise and scalable measurements of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype. Using computer vision and machine learning methods, we have created a novel, quantitative method for fine-grained analysis of social interactions. Our approach directly measures interpersonal motor synchrony, a construct which we use as a lens for understanding the social interaction differences that are at the core of ASD. Significance: Genomics and neuroimaging methods continuously evolve, providing deeper insights into the biology of ASD. However, methods for measuring the outward manifestations of ASD have not changed substantially in decades. ASD is fundamentally a disorder of social interaction, but current clinical tools do not directly measure observable social interactions. Instead, they summarize global impressions of these interactions via informant report questionnaires or observational coding schemes that typically lack the behavioral granularity needed to robustly measure individual differences and changes across time (e.g., treatment related change). Inter-rater agreement on questionnaires is typically modest, while the alternative “deep phenotyping” by expert clinicians is a time- consuming and often cost-prohibitive burden to studies, especially when large samples are required (e.g., in genomics research). Approach: To resolve these problems, our team created a novel computational framework that leverages advances in markerless video motion capture, computer vision, and machine learning to directly capture dyadic social interactions. This allows us to capture all behaviors observable by expert clinicians but with exquisite digital precision and objectivity. Preliminary Data: We developed a fully automatic quantitative assessment of interpersonal social behavior focused on features of dyadic facial motor synchrony. When applied to videos of brief conversations between confederates and young adults with or without ASD, our assessment predicted diagnostic status with 91% accuracy – significantly better than highly trained clinical experts assessing the same video recordings. The set of predictive social motor synchrony features that we identified also correlated significantly with symptom severity in the ASD group, suggesting that it can be used for both diagnostic classification and evaluating individual differences (vital for advancing precision medicine goals). Importantly, our findings were reproducible across samples: the same features identified in our adult analysis also predicted diagnosis in a child sample with high accuracy. Aims. In Aim 1, we will test the specificity of our computer vision approach by expanding comparisons to include a mixed psychiatric disorder group; Aim 2 will test dyadic synchrony in other body movements, and Aim 3 will define associations between interpersonal motor synchrony and dimensional aspects of social communication that span diagnostic categories. Impact: Our approach is designed for fast and rigorous assessment of social communication, providing a scalable solution to diagnosing ASD diagnosis and measuring individual variability, within a transdiagnostic, precision medicine framework. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project tests a new technique for measuring social communication problems in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Using markerless motion capture, computer vision, and machine learning, we will measure humans’ natural tendency to coordinate their behavior with a conversational partner. The results of this project will impact public health by making it easier to reliably diagnose ASD, providing access to precise phenotypic information for genotypic studies, and by providing the theoretical and empirical foundation for an objective way to determine whether some treatments work better than others.",Predicting Autism and Social Functioning from Computer Vision Analyses of Motor Synchrony During Dyadic Interactions,10057391,R01MH118327,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agreement', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biologic Development', 'Biology', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Individual Differences', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Severities', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computer framework', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'dyadic interaction', 'experimental study', 'impression', 'individual variation', 'informant', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lens', 'machine learning method', 'natural language', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology', 'young adult']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,720921
"Identification of outcome-based sub-populations using deep phenotyping and precision functional mapping across ADHD and ASD Project Summary  Two of the earliest onset, most common, and costly neurodevelopmental disorders in child psychiatry are Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of their nosological distinctions represents a fundamentally confounding factor limiting a better understanding of their etiology, prevention, and treatment. In short, simple design assumptions regarding `homogeneity in samples' in typical and atypical populations may explain the frequently very small effect sizes in psychopathology research. Clinically, these same assumptions may account for why treatments often have weak or unpredictable effects.  Recent developments in the computational sciences, have enabled the implementation of models sufficiently complex to address the aforementioned situation regarding subpopulations; however, very few tie the outputs to the specific outcome or questions being asked by the investigator. Under the parent grant, we developed and published a novel hybrid supervised/unsupervised machine learning method to characterize biologically relevant heterogeneity in ADHD and/or ASD – the Functional Random Forest (FRF). The hybrid FRF combines machine learning and graph theoretic analyses in order to identify population subtypes related to the clinically most important outcomes (in the case, of this proposal, negative valence symptoms) trans- diagnostically (ASD, ADHD, TD).  Despite developing the FRF, subtyping results using functional MRI (fMRI) signals have lagged behind the subtyping of behavioral profiles. In addition, they have yet to become sufficiently sensitive and specific, for rapid translation into clinical practice. Fortunately, parallel advances in functional neuroimaging, allow for precision functional mapping of individuals, and can be synergistically combined with the FRF to greatly boost our ability to subtype and characterize individual patients from fMRI data. Here we combine the FRF with precision mapping to reveal common variants and individual specificity in global brain organization. The proposed individual-specific precision mapping moves beyond group averaging approaches, which are obscuring important inter-individual differences related to distinct pathophysiologies underlying negative valence across diagnoses (ADHD, ASD, TD).  Thus, the current proposal aims to apply FRF algorithms to trans-diagnostic (TD, ASD, ADHD) behavioral and precision functional mapping RSFC data to identify distinct sub-populations across ASD, ADHD, and TD that relate to negative valence symptom dimensions. Project Narrative The proposed study uses novel, advanced imaging techniques (i.e. individual-specific Precision Functional Mapping of resting state functional connectivity MRI), along with new computational tools (i.e. Functional Random Forest) to identify atypical brain physiologies related to negative valence symptoms in trans- diagnostic fashion across ADHD, Autism and typical development. This work will utilize new methods to identify brain biomarkers related to important outcomes of interest (i.e. negative valence symptoms) independent of diagnostic category. The findings from this study will advance our knowledge of the neurobiological underpinnings of negative valence symptomatology, ADHD and Autism, and assist in the improved characterization of homogeneous subtypes for future genetic, functional, and therapeutic investigations.",Identification of outcome-based sub-populations using deep phenotyping and precision functional mapping across ADHD and ASD,10181076,R01MH096773,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anger', 'Anxiety', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Child', 'Child Psychiatry', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pediatrics', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Retinal blind spot', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'brain behavior', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parent grant', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized diagnostics', 'random forest', 'symptomatology', 'treatment stratification', 'treatment trial', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,1157073
"Scalable Computational Platform For Active Closed-Loop Behavioral Coding in Autism Spectrum Disorder SCALABLE COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM FOR ACTIVE CLOSED-LOOP BEHAVIORAL CODING IN  AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER ABSTRACT Despite significant recent advances in molecular genetics and neuroscience, behavioral ratings based on clinical observations are still the gold standard for screening, diagnosing, and assessing outcomes in neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Such behavioral ratings are subjective, require significant clinician expertise and training, typically do not capture data from the children in their natural environments, and are not scalable for large population screening, low-income communities, or longitudinal monitoring. The development of scalable digital approaches to standardized objective behavioral assessment is thus a significant unmet need in ASD, here addressed via machine learning and computer vision with the goal of providing scalable methods for assessing existing biomarkers, from eye tracking to movement and posture patterns, and tools for novel discovery. Our long-term goal is to develop validated scalable tools for the automatic behavioral analysis of neurodevelopmental disorders. The proposed computational project leverages results and big data derived from our previous studies (N=1,864 participants) and our recently funded NIH Autism Center of Excellence (ACE) award (N=7,436 participants). The ACE project will allow us to develop and validate our tools on several thousand toddlers recruited in Duke pediatric primary care and followed longitudinally for whom gold-standard diagnoses of ASD, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developmental and language delay and extensive electronic health record (EHR) data will be available; and in a case control study of 224 age-matched groups of young children with ASD, ADHD, and typical development from whom gold-standard diagnostic, extensive phenotypic, Tobii eye- tracking, and EEG will be collected. This project aims to develop novel computational methods using these datasets, from sensing in scalable fashion behaviors such as attention and gaze (Aim 1) and motor/posture (Aim 2), to their multimodal integration (Aim 3). A unique aspect of our computational approach is the closed- loop integration of stimuli design for actively eliciting behavioral symptoms, use of consumer-grade sensors, and automatic behavioral analysis. This contrasts with the current approach of independently selecting stimuli and using expensive lab-based professional grade sensors with off-the-shelf algorithms to capture behavioral biomarkers expected from the stimuli. Our approach involves active elicitation of behavior which is also different from commonly used digital approaches that involve gathering large datasets from passive sensing, such as actigraphy monitoring of spontaneous behavior at home. Our framework results in active closed-loop sensing, where participants are engaged in short and developmentally appropriate activities on ubiquitous devices, while the sensors in the same device capture information for the automatic and quantitative analysis of behavioral biomarkers. This scalable, objective, and standardized way of stimulating, sensing, and analyzing allows the collection of large behavioral datasets for machine learning. SCALABLE COMPUTATIONAL PLATFORM FOR ACTIVE CLOSED-LOOP BEHAVIORAL CODING IN  AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER NARRATIVE Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder affect 15% of children, most of them lacking the appropriate access to behavioral assessments for screening, diagnosis, or treatment to help them reach their full potential. To address this challenge, we are developing integrated, objective, and scalable computational tools for digital behavioral phenotyping that are based on computer vision and machine learning. The project brings together expertise in clinical and behavioral science with computer science and engineering to develop improved computational methods for scalable quantitative tools for behavioral assessment that will ultimately increase knowledge and access to screening, diagnosis, and treatment for ASD and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",Scalable Computational Platform For Active Closed-Loop Behavioral Coding in Autism Spectrum Disorder,10148819,R01MH120093,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalometry', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Knowledge', 'Language Delays', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Primary Health Care', 'Questionnaires', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Tablets', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computational platform', 'computer design', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'gaze', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor behavior', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'preference', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,387238
"Digitizing Human Vocal Interaction to Understand and Diagnose Autism Abstract This proposal tackles an urgent need for sensitive clinical outcome measures of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) by developing an objective, digital, multi-modal social communication metric using computational linguistics (e.g., acoustic features, turn-taking rates, word frequency metrics). Our automatic speech recognition and natural language analytics approach is designed to fix known weaknesses in traditional measurements by providing granular information in less time, with built-in scalability for characterizing very large samples. Since ASD is defined by observables, it is ripe for an automated approach to digitizing behavior (e.g., words, sounds, facial expressions, motor behaviors). This proposal piggybacks on a recently funded R01 that uses computer vision and machine learning to characterize nonverbal motor synchrony in teens with either ASD or another disorder in a brief social conversation (MH118327, PI: Schultz). Vocal components of the conversation are not studied in MH118327; thus, the richness of the verbal domain is left untapped. We hypothesize that automatically derived spoken language markers will significantly predict group and individual differences in social communication skill, and – when fused with nonverbal features – will lead to better prediction than either modality alone. Together, these two projects represent a rare chance to study all observable social signals emitted during social interaction in the same diverse sample of participants. If funded, this project will be the first to use short conversations and multi-modal data fusion to predict social communication skill and diagnostic group in a large, clinically diverse sample of individuals with ASD and other disorders. Our pilot studies showed that a relatively small set of vocal features from a six-minute interaction predicts diagnosis (ASD vs. typical development [TD]) with 84% accuracy. These machine learning analyses also predicted social communication skill dimensionally, providing a granular metric of individual differences. Combining this approach with nonverbal metrics (R01MH118327) using decision level data fusion resulted in significantly better ASD vs. TD prediction – 91% accuracy. These pilot results are promising, but several gaps remain. In Aim 1 of this proposal, we assess the specificity of our vocal social communication approach by including a non-ASD psychiatric control group in our machine learning classification models, in addition to ASD and TD groups (N=250/group). In Aim 2, we clinically validate our transdiagnostic dimensional metric in a large, diverse sample of participants. In Aim 3, we test whether novel, sophisticated multi-modal fusion methods that combine vocal and nonverbal social communication features result in improved individual and group prediction. This proposal lays critical groundwork for an automated, precision medicine approach to studying, diagnosing, and caring for individuals with ASD and other mental health conditions. Suc- cessful completion of this project will transform how we quantify human behavior for a broad array of applications that demand efficient, scalable, and reliable measurement (e.g., genetic association studies, clinical trials and standard clinical care), thus meeting multiple strategic priorities set by NIMH and NIDCD. Project Narrative At the most basic level, social communication boils down to what you say and what you do while interacting with other people. Problems with social communication affect individuals with ASD throughout their lives, but expensive and time-consuming measurement tools have hindered the development of effective treatments for this core challenge. In this proposal, we aim to improve clinical characterization and diagnostic decision- making in ASD and other psychiatric conditions by digitizing human vocal interaction and using advanced machine learning techniques to fuse audio-video signals into an autism-specific algorithm, thus laying the groundwork for future precision medicine efforts and advancing the state of public health.",Digitizing Human Vocal Interaction to Understand and Diagnose Autism,10165685,R01DC018289,"['Acoustics', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Companions', 'Complex', 'Computational Linguistics', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Furuncles', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Language', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Stream', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated speech recognition', 'clinical care', 'clinical outcome measures', 'cognitive process', 'data fusion', 'design', 'digital', 'dyadic interaction', 'effective therapy', 'genetic association', 'improved', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'learning classifier', 'meetings', 'motor behavior', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'natural language', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'sound', 'tool', 'trait']",NIDCD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R01,2021,595521
"ARGUS-MDS: automated, quantitative and scalable system for social processes in behavioral health Argus Cognitive STTR Grant Application Abstract Standardized behavioral observation methods are integral to developmental, educational, and behavioral science research. However, existing observational strategies are too laborious to use in large-scale, intervention and dissemination trials needed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In addition, current observational strategies do not yield sufficiently quantitative, comparable and granular assessment that could drive the comparison of therapies in clinical trials or the optimization and personalization of intervention. We are developing a minimally intrusive medical device technology (“ARGUS-MDS”) to simultaneously monitor multiple key social and problem behaviors in individuals with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Our team represents an essential collaboration between computer and clinical scientists with expertise in artificial intelligence (AI), NDDs, diagnostics, multi-modal interventions, and psychometrics. We seek support in the form of a Fast Track STTR grant to validate the psychometric properties of ARGUS-MDS and its ability to provide data on change in target behaviors in early childhood and school-aged children. This would then support the development of a scalable, digital treatment progress indicator for behaviors reflecting social, repetitive behavior, and associated symptom profiles in ASD. In Phase I, video and audio data will be collected during gold-standard diagnostic evaluations individuals with ASD (n=15). Aim 1.1 will establish quality and clinical validity of ARGUS-MDS algorithms for key social communication behaviors, while Aim 1.2 will evaluate test-retest reliability of biometric output. Phase I will show that ARGUS-MDS meets quality metrics for biometric output, validates the clinician- technician feedback system, and establishes intraclass correlation coefficients for automated social communication (AutoSC) output. In Phase II our focus shifts to establishing psychometric properties of derived scores for AutoSC analysis, evaluating convergence with established clinical and functional measures, and preparing for regulatory filing in Phase III. Aim 2.1. will develop scores from biometric data through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of social communication behaviors. Aim 2.2 evaluates correspondence of AutoSC scores to scores on standardized clinical assessments. Aim 2.3 develops a comprehensive Validation Strategy and executes Analytical Validation, per medical device design control regulation and FDA guidance. Phase II will develop scores from AutoSC output, evaluate measurement characteristics of AutoSC scores, reliability & validity of Autos SC scores, and executes all Analytical Validations per the strategy document and FDA guidance. Phase I and II milestones will set us up for commercialization in Phase III, including filing for regulatory approval and product launch. Successful completion of this project will provide a novel, scalable medical device technology to support objective, automated clinical evaluations of social impairments in ASD and other NDDs. Argus Cognitive STTR Grant Application NARRATIVE We seek to contribute to the digital health movement through validation of a minimally intrusive monitoring system (“ARGUS-MDS”) to simultaneously track multiple key social and problem behaviors in individuals with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including Fragile X Syndrome (FXS). This new technology will make diagnosis and monitoring of these disorders quantitative, scalable, and affordable, removing a serious bottleneck in the current patient journey, related to 1) the limited availability of highly trained human experts and 2) the qualitative and subjective nature of the results attained with current observational strategies. Using advanced video and audio analytics and machine learning, ARGUS-MDS achieves an automated, quantitative, and comprehensive assessment of each patient, across settings (clinical trials, academic research, specialty clinics, pediatric offices and homes), without requiring the presence of a human expert during the monitored diagnostic, monitoring or therapy sessions.","ARGUS-MDS: automated, quantitative and scalable system for social processes in behavioral health",10019734,R44MH121965,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Factor Analysis', 'Feedback', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention Trial', 'Language', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Nonverbal Communication', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Problem behavior', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychometrics', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Scientist', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Processes', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'analog', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'behavior observation', 'behavioral health', 'clinical practice', 'commercialization', 'communication behavior', 'digital health', 'digital treatment', 'disability', 'dissemination trial', 'early childhood', 'experimental study', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'gaze', 'improved', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'motor control', 'multi-component intervention', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'showing emotion', 'social', 'social communication', 'social deficits', 'social reciprocity']",NIMH,"ARGUS COGNITIVE, INC.",R44,2021,485065
"Harmonization for multisite Connectomics: parsing heterogeneity and creating markers in ASD Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a superior characterization of white matter and connectivity compared to other MRI modalities, and is routinely included in studies of disorders with atypical brain connectivity like autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The field could benefit tremendously from combining studies, to have comprehensive representation of the underlying heterogeneity in connectivity-based disorders. This is rendered challenging by dMRI being very sensitive to acquisition parameters, needing sophisticated statistical harmonization tools due to the complicated effect of scanner related changes. This also calls for a robust automated quality control (QC) protocol prior to data harmonization. Thus, in this proposal, we will develop tools to facilitate integration of dMRI data across studies. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a deep learning based tool for automating QC for dMRI data that will identify different data artifacts (caused by multiple sources like scanner, coil, scan parameters, motion etc), and the appropriate action that needs to be taken (like motion and eddy correction). In Aim 2, we will develop a suite of tools for harmonizing dMRI measures to remove acquisition differences. The effectiveness of our proposed tools will be demonstrated by harmonizing ~1500 datasets (ages 6-32 years) from 11 ASD studies. These large harmonized datasets create the need for a subject-wise characterization of the sample and for diagnostic markers that harness the imaging heterogeneity of the larger harmonized sample. To address this new need, we will develop additional connectomic analysis tools, that will be adapted to ASD to create the CHARM (Connectomic Heterogeneity in Autism Research through Multi-site dMRI harmonization) suite comprising of a generalizable biomarker of ASD, as well as a dimensional connectomic coordinate system. In Aim 3, we will characterize each subject using a connectivity phenotype, cluster the integrated ASD sample based on this connectivity-phenotype, define a classifier for each cluster; and create a connectivity-based ensemble biomarker of ASD, called the CHARM-marker, combining these cluster-specific classifier decisions. Finally, in Aim 4, we will create a subject-wise characterization of ASD by designing a multi-dimensional connectomic coordinate system using metric learning, to quantify the dissimilarity of each subject from the harmonized healthy controls. We will elucidate the link of these CHARM-coordinates to ASD constructs, by correlating core ASD symptoms with the CHARM coordinates in the harmonized/combined sample. This will enable the ASD community to associate informative connectomic dimensions with each subject, facilitating subject-wise longitudinal assessment, paving the way for precision medicine. Such a group- based and subject-wise characterization of ASD could not have been possible without data integration. Additionally, the neuroimaging community will have new dMRI harmonization and connectomic analysis tools enabling the integration of studies for a more comprehensive connectomic investigation of existing data. It will pave the way for such studies in other connectivity-related disorders that affect mental health. Project narrative The project aims at developing an automated quality assessment protocol and statistical harmonization tools for diffusion MRI data, that will enable the integration of data collected with different acquisition protocols. We will also create connectomic tools that will enable disorder- specific and patient-specific analysis of the harmonized data. Using these methods, we will combine several studies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and create a biomarker that capitalizes on the underlying imaging heterogeneity in the data, as well as place each ASD subject in a connectomic coordinate system, that will pave the way for precision medicine.",Harmonization for multisite Connectomics: parsing heterogeneity and creating markers in ASD,10092221,R01MH117807,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'autism community', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'indexing', 'large datasets', 'neuroimaging', 'precision medicine', 'preservation', 'repetitive behavior', 'sex', 'social', 'success', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,690443
"Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD Project Summary/Abstract Atypical responses to sensory stimuli are highly prevalent in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Somatosensory sensitivities in particular occur prominently and with high frequency in the disorder. While core symptomatology is comprised of both sensory dysfunctions and sociocommunicative deficits, the impact of aberrant somatosensory and multisensory processing on sociocommunication abilities remains unknown. It is not well-understood how sensory discrimination anomalies predict later sociocommunicative impairment, or which manifestations of sensory abnormalities result in more severe outcomes. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to investigate the behavioral and neural patterns underlying somatosensory and multisensory discrimination abnormalities longitudinally in young children with ASD compared to TD peers at 4-5 years and 6-7 years of age and identify potential patterns of developmental causality between sensory and sociocommunicative impairments. We theorize that behavioral dysfunction and disruptions in functional and structural connectivity between neural systems in ASD interfere with normative development. Within this theoretical framework, we make three key predictions regarding sensory processing in ASD: (1) Behavioral manifestations of sensory discrimination anomalies in ASD will be objectively observable and quantifiable; (2) functional and structural connectivity patterns within and between sensory and multisensory networks will be atypical; and (3) these atypical network connections will be linked to behavioral manifestations of sensory abnormalities, and combined will predict later sociocommunicative impairments. To examine these hypotheses, we propose a longitudinal and multimodal approach, including behavioral measures, task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), resting state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and neuropsychological indices, along with machine- learning methods, which will be able to reveal distinct patterns within and across modalities, and pinpoint patterns that may most heavily impact autism symptomatology in young children. The distinct strengths of this proposal lie in the application of quantitative behavioral measures to examine sensory discrimination thresholds in young developmental populations, in combination with the use of advanced neuroimaging tools to measure functional activity and (functional and structural) network connectivity between multiple brain systems and the implementation of machine-learning predictive approaches.  The proposed training plan incorporates analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological evaluation and assessment, which are essential to the applicant's research goals of investigating sensory abnormalities in, and atypical development of, the brain and behavior. This career development award will permit her to develop new expertise necessary for successful completion of the proposed research, while building upon her extensive experience of multisensory development and functional neuroimaging in young children. The Psychology Department at San Diego State University, together with the carefully selected mentorship team, will create an exceptional training environment to further her long-term career goal to become a successful, independent autism researcher in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience with a focus on sensorimotor processing. Project Narrative The proposed research investigation seeks to examine the impact of somatosensory and multisensory abnormalities on sociocommunication deficits in young children with autism longitudinally. Training over the duration of the career development award will emphasize analytic approaches to multimodal neuroimaging and machine-learning, as well as training in neuropsychological assessment, which will provide the PI with expertise necessary for investigating the links between behavioral and neural mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of sensory manifestations and autism symptomatology. As the increasing prevalence of autism renders it a serious public health issue, findings from the proposed research will have implications for early detection and intervention directed toward sensory processing.",Impact of Multisensory Function on Symptomatology in Young Children with ASD,10205977,K01MH113819,"['7 year old', 'Age', 'Anisotropy', 'Applications Grants', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychology', 'Psychophysics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sensory', 'Sensory Manifestations', 'Severities', 'Social Interaction', 'Stereotyping', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TEP1 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'autistic children', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'comparative', 'developmental psychology', 'experience', 'falls', 'haptics', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'multisensory', 'neural patterning', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'peer', 'relating to nervous system', 'repetitive behavior', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'sensory discrimination', 'sensory input', 'sensory integration', 'sensory stimulus', 'somatosensory', 'support network', 'symptomatology', 'tool']",NIMH,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,195916
"Data-driven multidimensional modeling of nonverbal communication in typical and atypical development ABSTRACT This proposal will develop innovative technology for data-driven, multimodal characterization of nonverbal communication (NVC) in typical and atypical development. Prior research has provided qualitative descriptions of the development of children's use of gaze and gesture to regulate social interactions, but there are no objective, automated tools for measuring NVC behaviors, nor computational models to explain their coordination and timing in social interactions. This proposal will apply advanced probabilistic modeling techniques from machine learning and data mining to a rich corpus of children's behavior, including automated measures of children's posture, head pose, gaze direction, arm movements, and hand configurations derived from color and depth cameras and accelerometers. By automatically learning probabilistic latent variable models from movement data, we will obtain compact, data-driven descriptions of NVC and its coordination in children with autism, children with developmental delays without autism, and typically developing children (Aim 1). We will validate our models by demonstrating their ability to predict children's behavior, including diagnostic group and one-year language outcomes (Aim 2). We will test whether novel NVC patterns can be uncovered with bottom-up clustering of motor movement data (Aim 3). We predict our models will have greater explanatory and predictive power compared to current measures of NVC, which are typically human-coded behaviors that are descriptive, but rely on a-priori definitions of higher level behaviors. The models we develop will capture the fine-grained structure, coordination, and timing of NVC behaviors during social interactions, and thus allow us to characterize these behaviors with an unprecedented level of detail. Because interventions for young children with ASD target NVC skills, our automated measurement tools will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to assess the extent to which these treatments are efficacious. In addition, automated tools for dense measurement of fine-grained changes in NVC would enable clinicians to assess profiles of strengths and weaknesses for purposes of treatment planning, to dynamically tailor treatment to clients' changing abilities, and ultimately to accurately capture whether treatment is working. Finally, the measurement capabilities will provide researchers with a novel, cost-effective approach to analyze video recordings, at a scale that is not currently feasible due to a reliance on human coding.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 68 children in the US. This project is focused on developing automated tools to characterize behaviors considered to be core, early emerging markers of autism, and that represent common treatment targets in this group.

"Neurocomputational mechanisms of proactive social behavior deficits in autism spectrum disorder Project Summary Social interaction deficits are at the crux of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and contribute to significant functional impairment, including poorer relationship quality and low employment rates in individuals with ASD. Despite an enormous amount of research dollars invested and thousands of research papers published on the topic, we remain far from understanding the basic neural computations underlying social processes in ASD. In the current proposal, we posit that this information gap is due in part to the rarity with which computational model- based analyses are used in ASD neuroimaging research. Additionally, most studies use passive paradigms (e.g. face perception) rather than examining brain functioning while participants engage in ecologically-relevant, interactive social tasks more akin to the type of interactions with which people with ASD struggle in their daily lives. This proposal takes an innovative computational psychiatry approach to understanding aberrant neural computations of social interactions in ASD, using high-resolution (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and virtual reality-like tasks that test individuals’ abilities to proactively and dynamically engage in simulated social interactions. In particular, we focus on the ability of individuals with ASD to: 1) discriminate and track levels of closeness and power when navigating social interactions in a choose-your-own-adventure style interactive paradigm, and 2) understand and adapt to social norms and exert control over social others in the context of a proactive social exchange paradigm. We use novel computational models to examine the neural computations and connectivity underlying proactive social behavior, focusing on brain regions (e.g., hippocampus) that have been understudied in the context of social deficits in ASD. Finally, we use machine learning approaches to explore ASD heterogeneity along dimensions of dynamic and proactive social interactions and apply these indices to make clinically-meaningful predictions. We hypothesize that: 1) hippocampal tracking of social space will be less robust in ASD as compared to neurotypical controls and will correlate with social symptoms; 2) ASD individuals will show slower norm adaptation rate, greater aversion to norm violation, and reduced social controllability, accompanied by reduced neural encoding of social values in anterior insula and ventral striatum; and 3) these parameters will help identify subtypes of ASD and predict ASD- relevant outcomes (e.g. social skills, adaptive social functioning, quality of life). We expect that findings from this project will break new ground and fill critical knowledge gaps regarding the neurobiology of ASD. In particular, we expect our findings will greatly enhance understanding of the neural and computational mechanisms underlying deficits in proactive social behavior in ASD and will allow us to identify distinct, neurobiologically- driven clusters. In so doing, the results of this project could offer new tools by which to subtype the ASD phenotype and provide novel insights into treatment targets. Project Narrative Despite social deficits being core features of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and contributing to relationship difficulties and low employment rates, their neurobiological underpinnings are poorly understood. The goal of this study is to gain new knowledge about the brain mechanisms underlying social deficits in autism using computational modeling, novel brain imaging tools, and interactive experimental tasks that simulate dynamic social interactions.

"Investigating quantitative signatures of autism in toddlers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex disorders manifested by qualitatively atypical social communication skills and an aberrant behavioral repertoire that vary in severity across individuals. We lack neurobiologically-grounded predictors of autism in the general population. Our studies seek to fill this critical gap in our knowledge about neurobiologically-grounded quantitative signatures that precede manifestations of ASD in toddlers recruited from the general population. We aim to (i) apply advanced computational analytic techniques to formally chart the emergence of atypical developmental trajectories, and (ii) uncover and validate neurobiologically-grounded, clinically meaningful subtypes predictive of future risk for atypical development, revolutionizing brain imaging in young children. In our previous work we have discovered that head movements during functional MRI provide an abundant source of useful movement data whose statistical features are linked to clinical and cognitive outcomes in children and adults diagnosed with ASD. Our recent studies have revealed that quantitative signatures of atypical learning trajectories can be detected as early as 1-2 months in infants at high familial risk for developing ASD. Atypical functioning of the sensorimotor system has deleterious functional consequences across diverse domains of learning and development and may contribute to ASD manifestations, in toddlers screened prospectively in the general population. Using data from the NIH-funded National Database for Autism Research (NDAR) we will test whether atypical movement variability during MRI scans during the 2nd year of life in N=212 toddlers from the general population is predictive of ASD or non-ASD outcomes (vs. typical development, TD) ascertained during the 3rd year. We will rigorously quantify key kinematic parameters during MRI scans acquired in toddlers ages 12-24 months according to different conditions, including sleeping or resting, while language is presented to sleeping toddlers, and also during a socially-orienting scan. We hypothesize that deleterious, context-incongruent signatures during the 2nd year of life in toddlers will be related subsequently to greater ASD manifestations at 36-48 months. Machine learning algorithms will be used to classify ASD, non-ASD, and TD toddlers. The overall goal of these studies is to illuminate the neurobiological basis of sensorimotor variability in toddlers from the general population and to establish that sensorimotor signatures are part and parcel of the child’s future ASD diagnosis, a finding which will have profound, transformative implications for neuroimaging methods in young children. This knowledge will provide new, early mechanistic insights into the basis of such associations recently established in children, adolescents, and adults with and without ASD, as well as in human infants, and advance Research Priorities of the NIMH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are complex neurodevelopmental disorders manifested by atypical social communication and behavioral repertoire. The current studies aim to reveal how sensorimotor impairments may underlie, contribute, and regulate the neurobiology of this condition in toddlers recruited from the general population during the 2nd year of life and who were assessed for ASD vs. non-ASD outcomes during the 3rd year of life. Features of the neurobiologically grounded subtypes of ASD developed as part of this proposal will be used in future studies to predict diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders, in children with low-functioning form of ASD, those at risk for developing ASD, and those children with related disorders of neurodevelopment.",Investigating quantitative signatures of autism in toddlers,10127705,R01MH121605,"['3 year old', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Equilibrium', 'Esthesia', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Head Movements', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Perception', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sensorimotor functions', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Siblings', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'design', 'functional MRI scan', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'sensorimotor system', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'sound']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TEACHERS COLLEGE,R01,2021,360836
