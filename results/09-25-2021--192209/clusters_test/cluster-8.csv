"Analysis and Prediction of Molecular Interactions Abstract Our research focuses on molecular recognition, with the goal of providing methods and software for solving biomedical problems. The primary areas of interest are protein-protein interactions and the ligand binding properties of proteins. We believe that predictive methods will be substantially improved during the next five years due to the increasing amount of information on sequences, structures, and interactions of molecules in the cell, and the unprecedented availability of computing power. To take advantage of these opportunities we will integrate the use of structural templates, co-evolutionary information, and machine learning into classical biophysical methods. Our rigid body protein docking server ClusPro, which has over 15,000 users, will be combined with our new template based server ClusPro TBM. We also add elements of flexible docking, either by remodeling the regions that cause steric conflicts, or by using a neural net for calculating post-minimization energy values without performing the actual minimization. Several tools will be combined for the structural analysis of protein interaction networks, including a novel method of constructing multi-protein complexes based on pre-calculated tables of interaction energies between pairs of proteins. Examples of applications include the design of PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) for modulating a target protein by degradation, the prediction of antibody epitopes, and searching for epitope-specific antibodies. To study the ligand binding properties of proteins we focus on binding hot spots, regions of proteins that are major contributors to the binding free energy. Our FTMap server globally samples the surface of target proteins using fragment sized molecular probes and provides reliable hot spot and pharmacophore information. We will improve the scoring function using neural nets, and expand the set of probes to obtain generalized pharmacophores that identify regions in the protein binding site with preferences for specific functional groups and a number of bound fragments. Since this information can be used to find larger ligands, the goal is to convert FTMap into a fragment based ligand discovery platform. We will also improve our template-based server LigTBM, which docks small molecules to proteins, and will integrate template-based modeling with FTMap. In a collaborative application we will analyze metabolite-protein interaction data obtained by precision mass spectrometry in E. coli and human protein pull-down experiments. FTMap will be used to test whether a target protein has a suitable binding hot spot, and LigTBM will place the metabolite. We are particularly interested in finding metabolites that bind at novel allosteric regulatory sites. A related application will be to study ensembles of structures obtained by dynamic simulations to find potential correlations between FTMap derived binding properties at different regions of proteins, thus exploring potential allosteric communication. Narrative Our research focuses on molecular interactions, and we develop methods for protein-protein docking and the characterization of ligand binding properties of proteins. Predictive tools for these applications will be substantially improved by integrating classical biophysical approaches with sequence, structure, and interaction information on biological macromolecules, and by utilizing the unprecedented availability of computer power. The methods will be implemented as web-based servers for use by the biomedical research community.",Analysis and Prediction of Molecular Interactions,10175504,R35GM118078,"['Antibodies', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Docking', 'Elements', 'Epitopes', 'Escherichia coli', 'Free Energy', 'Goals', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Probes', 'Multiprotein Complexes', 'Online Systems', 'Property', 'Protac', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'base', 'biophysical techniques', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'functional group', 'improved', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'molecular recognition', 'molecular size', 'novel', 'pharmacophore', 'predictive tools', 'preference', 'protein degradation', 'protein metabolite', 'protein protein interaction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R35,2021,576150
"Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM Project Summary/Abstract My laboratory's research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms key to the regulation of membrane protein function and to the modulation of their output signaling. We use cryo-EM and advanced classification methods, such as manifold embedding, combined with modeling and molecular dynamics to study how ligands produce shifts in conformation equilibria and bias signaling output. We are currently studying two systems that allow us to study how different types of ligands influence the gating of ion channels. We are studying the role of lipids in triggering gating of mechanosensitive channels of the MscS family, a model system of membrane tension-sensing which can yield important information about the fundamental principles governing ion channel gating and the role that lipid-protein interactions play in this process. We have a longstanding interest in the mechanism and modulation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), a calcium release channel fundamental to heart and skeletal function. We are using manifold embedding, a machine learning-based method to analyze cryo-EM images, to better understand how small molecules and ions such as calcium and ATP affect the conformational energy landscape of the channel. We aim to shed light on the gating mechanism of this very large ion channel, a prerequisite to understanding of its modulation by protein ligands, post-translational modifications and drugs. Our approach to these fundamental problems is to use a commbination of cryo-electron microscopy, advanced image classification techniques, modelling and molecular dynamics simulations to delineate allosteric pathways mechanistically and then test proposed models with biophysical methods such as single-channel measurements, HDX-MS and mutagenesis. Our ultimate aim is to greatly increase our molecular understanding of the gating and allosteric modulation of ion channels. Progress towards such knowledge has the potential to open the way for the design of small molecule allosteric modulators with very well controlled effects on their targets, aiding the development of drugs with limited side effects. A longer-term aim is to further develp and use our tools towards gaining a better understanding of allosteric modulation in other classes of membrane proteins of therapeutic importance. In particular, G protein-coupled receptor ligands can induce the selective binding of different transducers in a process called biased signaling. The molecular mechanisms at play in this process are still poorly understood despite their fundamental importance for the development of safer drugs. Project Narrative Ion channels are involved in a large number of vital processes, such as heart and muscle function for the ryanodine receptor and function of kidneys and regulation of blood pressure for mechanosensitive channels. This work focuses on understanding the function and regulation of ion channels. Better understanding of small ligand and lipid-protein interactions in these channels can lead more generally to a better understanding of ion channels function and to the design of drugs treating the numerous diseases associated with their malfunction.",Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM,10178048,R35GM133598,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Calcium', 'Classification', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Family', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Ion Channel', 'Ion Channel Gating', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Muscle function', 'Mutagenesis', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transducers', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical techniques', 'blood pressure regulation', 'design', 'drug development', 'heart function', 'interest', 'molecular dynamics', 'protein function', 'side effect', 'skeletal', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,ADVANCED SCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER,R35,2021,392500
"Genome-wide structure-based analysis of protein-protein interactions and networks Project Summary  Our lab works in the general area of computational structural biology although it also includes an experimental component. We carry out theoretical and computational research and develop software tools, with our efforts being guided by a variety of applications of biomedical importance. In the past we have elucidated the structural and energetic origins of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions, developed methods for protein structure prediction, and detected novel structural and functional relationships between proteins based on their geometric similarity. We currently focus on two distinct areas: the exploitation of structural information to predict protein function on a genome-wide scale and the molecular basis of cell-cell recognition. The former topic is the subject of the current proposal which focuses on the prediction of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein interaction networks. Our overarching goal is to provide a structure-informed perspective in multiple areas of systems biology, thus filling a major gap in this rapidly growing area of biomedical research.  Our research plans are derived from our development of the PrePPI algorithm and corresponding database of human PPIs. PrePPI provides proteome-wide structure-based predictions of PPIs, and discovers relationships not obtainable from other methods. The P-HIPSTer algorithm, which is derived from PrePPI, offers analogous information for virus-human PPIs for 1000 human-infecting viruses. The reliability of both resources has been validated experimentally, and both have revealed novel biological insights. PrePPI, in common with other PPI databases, is cell-context independent and, for example, does not distinguish among tissue and tumor types. To address this challenge, we developed the OncoSig algorithm that uses machine learning methods to combine PrePPI with regulatory interactions from patient genomic data. The generation of tumor-specific lists of PPIs, called SigSets, can then be mapped onto a context-dependent PPI network, or SigMap. We have also developed novel methodologies that link protein structure space with chemical compound space.  The current proposal builds on these accomplishments with new methodological developments and new applications to network biology. We plan to integrate PrePPI with PPI information derived from genetic interactions derived from the correlation of gene profiles across many conditions (e.g. tumor types, cell lines or drug treatments). This will provide an unprecedented structure- and context-dependent view of protein interaction networks. Other plans include the extension of PrePPI to non-human genomes and the extension of P-HIPSTer to bacterial pathogens. Our overall vision includes the development of an integrated set of software tools and databases that will advance cutting edge biomedical applications. These tools will range in scope from protein- protein interaction networks, structure-derived protein function annotation and to the linking of network biology to chemical compound space which will suggest druggable targets within networks and provide leads for small molecules that can target individual proteins. Project Narrative This project focuses on the modeling and incorporation of protein three-dimensional structures across the human proteome to further our ability to describe disease-related protein-protein interaction networks in tissue- and tumor-specific contexts. These structure-informed networks will reveal mechanistic insights regarding cellular processes underlying human diseases ranging from cancer to those resulting from viral and bacterial infection. Our results will also provide hypotheses regarding drugs that can target proteins in these networks.",Genome-wide structure-based analysis of protein-protein interactions and networks,10086553,R35GM139585,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'druggable target', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'human disease', 'insight', 'link protein', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'structural biology', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tumor']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R35,2021,405000
"Towards Accurate Protein Structure Predictions with SAXS Technology (TAPESTRY) Project Summary There is an unmet need in medicine and basic sciences for accurate atomic structures of proteins. This need surpasses the capabilities of traditional high-resolution experimental methods. With machine learning advances, structure prediction algorithms are poised to provide atomic models for these areas in the near future. Yet, the gaps in prediction algorithms limit accuracy and reliability, particularly for large multi-domain proteins, protein complexes, and flexible proteins. Our proposal, Towards Accurate protein structure Predictions with SAXS TechnologY (TAPESTRY), will create technology to increase reliability and improve accuracy of protein structure predictions through experimental validation, particularly for difficult proteins. TAPESTRY is innovative by combining our strengths in high-throughput synchrotron SAXS (Small Angle X-ray Scattering) data collection and analysis with the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP), which assesses structure predictions against “gold standard”, not-yet-released crystal structures every two years. Through CASP, we take advantage of the collective protein folding knowledge of the global community of structure prediction scientists. Our approach is strategic. We provide SAXS data for CASP, giving prediction scientists access to experimental data. We develop analytical and experimental tools, designed for prediction scientists to overcome current gaps that limit the use of SAXS data. We test these tools against our TAPESTRY databases of standard proteins, with corresponding crystal structures, SAXS data, and predicted models. Finally, we evaluate the robustness of our technology through CASP and obtain an unbiased assessment of our tools and the state of the field. As a first step, we target well-folded proteins (Aim 1) and proteins with disordered tails (Aim 2) in this proposal. The feasibility of our technology proposal is supported by our current data and proofs-in-concepts, our beamline capabilities, and proven experience in SAXS analysis. We show that experimental SAXS data, which contains distance information that can act as restraints in protein structure prediction algorithms, match crystal structures of well-folded proteins and score predictions based on topological accuracy. We show cases in CASP13 (2018) when SAXS data improved the fold of predicted models. SAXS data collection is rapid (10 seconds), does not require labeling or crystallization, and is available at no cost to the scientific community. We have proven experience in developing informative and effective SAXS analytical tools. Our long-term goal is to enable biomedical researchers to input an amino acid sequence and rapidly obtain an experimentally validated and accurate atomic model(s) that reflects the protein conformation(s) in solution. If TAPESTRY is successful, the increased availability of such atomic models will have strong and broad potential to advance biomedical research and impact all areas of biology in which proteins are involved. PROJECT NARRATIVE Atomic structures are critical for medical science from understanding how proteins function to drug design. Structure prediction algorithms could provide atomic models for these purposes in the near future. This proposal will leverage the structure-based technology, Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), to develop methods to experimentally validate these atomic models and increase their accuracy.",Towards Accurate Protein Structure Predictions with SAXS Technology (TAPESTRY),10171872,R01GM137021,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bypass', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Synchrotrons', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'beamline', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'risk prediction', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2021,406940
"Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes Despite rapid progress in structural bioinformatics, a rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical framework is missing in our current toolbox for analysis, classification, and organization of individual as well as groups of biomolecules. We have recently developed such a framework based on the elastic shape analysis (ESA) for the comparison of protein and RNA structures. Under this framework, the formal geodesic distance for any two protein/RNA structures can be computed rapidly. Probability distributions can also be built for families of protein/RNA structures, and can be used to classify structures in a principled way through statistical hypothesis testing. In addition, sequence information can be naturally incorporated so that comparison of structures can be conducted in the joint sequence-structure space. We have also developed novel algorithms for matching and analyzing protein surfaces. We propose to significantly further develop these methodologies for important applications in structure biology, including studying chromosome structures by combining both 30 structure and sequence level information. The proposed research will make significant contributions to the following areas: (1) This proposal will fill an important gap in structure biology - the lack of a rigorous mathematical and statistical framework for biomolecular structure comparison; (2) Our proposed unifying framework will allow natural incorporation of sequence information for structure comparison; (3) Our approach can uncover distinct clusters at the deepest level of current classification scheme (i.e. SCOP family), enabling a finer classification of biomolecular structures. Preliminary results indicate that by using carefully measured structural similarity, we will obtain representative sets of proteins of higher quality than those by current sequence similarity based methods; (4) The probabilistic models designed for protein/RNA backbone structures and surfaces will capture the flexible nature of protein structures through the use of ensemble of conformations, while maintaining high computational efficiency. These models will also enable effective characterization of family-specific variations among proteins, an important task none of the existing methods work well; (5) Protein/RNA structures will be organized using network-based data structures using probabilistic approaches. This new organization will effectively integrates sequence, backbone structure, and surface information, facilitating discovery of novel insight; and (6) these new development will be rapidly generalized for studying chromosome structures. This proposed research will allow development of tools that will also be applicable in other areas of shape analysis, including medical image analysis, computer vision, and pattern recognition. Our work will help to increase the communication between the field of protein structure analysis and the field of shape analysis, and will stimulate more cross-over development in methodology and transform research activities in both fields. Analysis, classification and organization of biomolecules are fundamental tasks essential for understanding the sequence-structure-function relationships of biomolecules. In this project, we aim to develop rigorous and unifying mathematical and statistical frameworks for such tasks and apply them to study proteins, RNAs and chromosomes.",Collaborative Research: Mathematical Framework for Biomolecules: From Protein to RNA to Chromosomes,10189648,R01GM126558,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chromosome Structures', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Family Planning', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Grain', 'Hi-C', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Protein Analysis', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Sampling', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Trees', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'database structure', 'design', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'genome annotation', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical model', 'network models', 'novel', 'organizational structure', 'protein distribution', 'protein structure', 'shape analysis', 'structural biology', 'structural genomics', 'success', 'tool development']",NIGMS,FLORIDA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,308756
"Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction Abstract The success of genome sequencing over the last four decades has resulted in a rapidly increasing gap between the number of known protein sequences and the number of known protein structures and functions. Because protein sequence on its own cannot tell us what each molecule does in cells, the large-scale absence of protein structure and function information severely hinders the progress of contemporary biological and medical studies. These gaps in understanding strongly call for efficient computational approaches for automated, yet highly accurate protein structure prediction and function annotation. The PI’s lab has a successful track record in developing and disseminating high-quality structural bioinformatics methods which have been widely used by the global community. In this project, the lab seeks to develop new advanced methods for both tertiary and quaternary protein structure prediction. Built on the tools and databases previously developed in the PI’s lab, new deep neural-network based techniques will be extended to residue-level intra- and inter-chain contact- and distance-map predictions. These predictions will then be used to constrain the conformational searching space of threading-based fragment assembly simulations, with the aim to significantly improve the accuracy and success rate of structure modeling of monomeric proteins and protein-protein interactions (PPIs), especially for the difficult targets that lack homologous templates in the Protein Data Bank. Next, the structure and PPI network information will be used to help elucidate multiple levels of biological and biomedical functions for protein molecules, including mutation-induced changes in protein stability and human disease predictions. The long- term goals of this project are to significantly improve the state of the art of protein structure prediction and to narrow the gap between the abundance of protein sequence information and the dearth of protein structure and function data, thus significantly enhancing the usefulness and impact of structural bioinformatics. Success in this project will also help reveal the general principles governing the fundamental relations across sequence, structure and function of protein molecules. Relevance Researchers in contemporary drug industry need to use the knowledge of 3-dimensional structure of protein molecules for designing synthetic compounds to fight against human diseases. But many pharmaceutically important proteins do not have experimentally solved structures. This project seeks to develop advanced computer methods for high-quality protein structure prediction that can be used to function annotation and compound screening; these should have an important and general impact on drug discovery and human health.",Advanced approaches to protein structure prediction,10132358,R35GM136422,"['ART protein', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Drug Industry', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Induced Mutation', 'Information Networks', 'Knowledge', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Network-based', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Proteins', 'Quaternary Protein Structure', 'Research Personnel', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'base', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'fight against', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'protein data bank', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'protein structure function', 'protein structure prediction', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R35,2021,514097
"MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal is to develop MELD, a computational Bayesian accelerator that “melds” together molecular dynamics simulations with external knowledge. It is novel in harnessing information that has not been usable before – because it is too sparse, noisy, ambiguous, combinatoric, or too corrupted for traditional approaches. In contrast to the high-certainty restraints traditionally used in MD simulations, MELD leverages a much broader range of real-world high-uncertainty restraints. The first specific aim is to incorporate such information in protein structure determination, in several collaboration projects with experimentalists who perform solution x-ray scattering, ESR, and high-throughput alanine scanning structures of peptide protein complexes. The second aim is to also harness information about processes, trajectories, and dynamic routes to speed the identification of protein states. MELD promises to extend physics-based simulations for determining larger protein structures, for folding larger proteins, for binding more flexible ligands, and for exploring larger mechanistic actions, than current MD simulation methods can handle. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomedical research and pharmaceutics depend on detailed understanding of the structures and motions of proteins. Molecular dynamics simulations provide the most detailed descriptions possible, however they cannot yet describe average to large sized protein structures or motions within a reasonable time frame. We propose to develop a new physics-based computational accelerator for Molecular Dynamics, called MELD, which incorporates many types of relevant external information that was too vague and difficult to compute to have been practically useful before.",MELD: accelerating MD modeling of proteins using Bayesian inference,10075288,R01GM125813,"['Affinity', 'Alanine', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Bayesian Method', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Combinatorics', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Homology Modeling', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Computations', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Pharmacy (field)', 'Physics', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Virginia', 'base', 'blind', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'peptide structure', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'restraint', 'scale up', 'simulation']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2021,317007
"Combined computational and structural studies to create novel macromolecular recognition properties PROJECT SUMMARY The design of macromolecular binding interactions and complexes, and corresponding alteration of binding specificity, is a challenging endeavor that remains recalcitrant to computational approaches. This is true both for the creation of protein-protein complexes (which are driven by a enthalpic changes established primarily by stereochemical complementarity, balanced against large competing entropic changes) and for the redesign of protein-DNA complexes (which are heavily dependent upon DNA bending, hydrogen-bonds, electrostatic contacts, and the presence of solvent and counterions throughout the molecular interface). Over the past several years we have collaborated with several computational groups to help develop and validate computational approaches for the design and optimization of protein-protein recognition, protein-DNA recognition, and protein-small molecule recognition. Those studies have contributed to several new computational engineering approaches, including hybrid strategies that combine ab initio design of protein folds and binding sites, the ‘Rotamer Interaction Feld’ (RIF) docking protocol for efficient sampling of protein sequence and conformation, and novel parametric design approaches to create new tandem repeat proteins. We propose to continue this work through two specific aims to further develop and improve upon computational approaches for protein design. As part of this project, we will solve atomic resolution crystal structures of many selected and designed molecular complexes and provide them to our immediate collaborators as well as to a public structure prediction project, for computational prediction challenges. Aim 1. We will design and characterize novel self-associating circular tandem repeat proteins (using both de novo computational design and using high-throughput selections) and then further design them to undergo ligand-induced protein-protein association. Beyond the challenge of combining protein scaffold design and ligand binding design, the motivation for this aim is to determine the structural and mechanistic features of small molecule ligand-binding, and balance of forces, that facilitate ligand-induced protein-protein association. Aim 2. We will improve our understanding and ability to design novel protein-DNA recognition specificities and behaviors. To accomplish this, we will: (1) Systematically select and optimize a series of variants of a model DNA-binding protein, that display altered binding specificity across two regions of partially overlapping sequential clusters of basepairs and neighboring protein residues. (2) Determine the high-resolution structures and binding behavior of each construct. (3) Supervise blinded computational efforts, using multiple approaches, to predict the same structures. (4) Compare and analyze the results of computational predictions versus multiple computational prediction strategies to define features influencing predictive accuracy. For both aims, we will further exploit our crystallographic structures by computationally ‘reverse engineering’ each construct using validated protein structures, to further understand the performance of design approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE The redesign of a macromolecular binding interfaces and corresponding alteration of specificity is a challenging endeavor that remains recalcitrant to structure-based computational approaches.

"Interpretable and extendable deep learning model for biological sequence analysis and prediction Project Abstract Bioinformatics and computational biology have become the core of biomedical research. The PI Dr. Dong Xu's work in this area focuses on development of novel computational algorithms, software and information systems, as well as on broad applications of these tools and other informatics resources for diverse biological and medical problems. He works on many research problems in protein structure prediction, post-translational modification prediction, high-throughput biological data analyses, in silico studies of plants, microbes and cancers, biological information systems, and mobile App development for healthcare. He has published more than 300 papers, with about 12,000 citations and H-index of 55. In this project, the PI proposes to develop deep-learning algorithms, tools, web resources for analyses and predictions of biological sequences, including DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. The availability of these data provides emerging opportunities for precision medicine and other areas, while deep learning as a cutting-edge technology in machine learning, presents a new powerful method for analyses and predictions of biological sequences. With rapidly accumulating sequence data and fast development of deep-learning methods, there is an urgent need to systematically investigate how to best apply deep learning in sequence analyses and predictions. For this purpose, the PI will develop cutting-edge deep-learning methods with the following goals for the next five years:  (1) Develop a series of novel deep-learning methods and models to specifically target biological sequence analyses and predictions in: (a) general unsupervised representations of DNA/RNA, protein and SNP/mutation sequences that capture both local and global features for various applications; (b) methods to make deep-learning models interpretable for understanding biological mechanisms and generating hypotheses; (c) “rule learning”, which abstracts the underlying “rules” by combining unsupervised learning of large unlabeled data and supervised learning of small labeled data so that it can classify new unlabeled data.  (2) Apply the proposed deep-learning model to DNA/RNA sequence annotation, genotype-phenotype analyses, cancer mutation analyses, protein function/structure prediction, protein localization prediction, and protein post-translational modification prediction. The PI will exploit particular properties associated with each of these problems to improve the deep-learning models. He will develop a set of related prediction and analysis tools, which will improve the state-of-art performance and shed some light on related biological mechanisms.  (3) Make the data, models, and tools freely accessible to the research community. The system will be designed modular and open-source, available through GitHub. They will be available like integrated circuit modules, which are universal and ready to plug in for different applications. The PI will develop a web resource for biological sequence representations, analyses, and predictions, as well as tutorials to help biologists with no computational knowledge to apply deep learning to their specific research problems.

"Interplay of inherent promiscuity and specificity in protein biochemical function with applications to drug discovery and exome analysis PROJECT SUMMARY Although the past two decades witnessed the large-scale analyses of cellular components, e.g. exomes, their impact on drug discovery and precision medicine has been modest. For example, 6/7 drug candidates failed safety and 3/4 failed efficacy in recent FDA clinical trials. These unsolved, but related issues, safety and efficacy, reflect significant gaps in understanding of the triangular interrelationship between diseases, molecular function, and drug treatments. A key conceptual limitation of contemporary drug discovery is the often implicitly assumed single drug for a single protein target disease model. In reality, most diseases are caused by multiple malfunctioning molecules. Whether it be disease treatment or precision medicine diagnostics, there is often an inability to identify disease-associated mode of action (MOA) proteins. To begin to address these issues, in the current MIRA proposal, we developed a promising protein structure and network-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach, MEDICASCY, to predict disease-associated MOA proteins, drug indications, side effects and efficacy; however, much more needs to be done. Here, we propose to build on our successes and develop an integrated AI-based approach, MEDICASCY-X, that addresses the following: The first step in determining a drug’s MOA and off-target interactions is to identity its protein targets. This requires the structures of all human proteins and their complexes. While we predicted suitable models for at least one domain in 97% of human proteins, using deep learning, we will predict the structures of the missing domains, domain-domain orientations and protein- protein complexes. We will extend small molecule virtual ligand screening (VLS) to predict binding affinities based on the insight that interacting ring-protein subpocket geometries and chemistry are conserved across protein families, are often privileged chemical structures and are likely low free energy complexes. Cryptic protein pockets, recently recognized as important drug targets, will be predicted and included in our VLS approach. Antibody-based immunotherapies are powerful but have similar safety and efficacy issues as small-molecules; thus, their safety and efficacy will be predicted by MEDICASCY-X. While MEDICASCY works on an “averaged human”, MEDICASCY-X will consider individual genetic and epigenetic profiles to make it a true precision medicine tool. We will predict which MOA proteins should be targeted and if a protein’s MOA is due to a loss or gain of function. The same framework will predict synergistic drug-drug interactions. Another way to prioritize MOA proteins is by disease comorbidity: proteins occurring in multiple diseases are likely important. If disease comorbidity can be predicted, we will construct the “Phylogenetic” Tree(s) of Diseases that would facilitate a deeper understanding of disease interrelationships. As proof of principle of the effectiveness of the algorithms being developed, novel preclinical treatments for a variety of intractable diseases will be developed. Thus, this project could enhance the success rates of drug discovery and precision medicine while reducing time and cost. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite the explosion of biological knowledge that has occurred since the turn of the century, the impact on drug discovery and precision medicine has been modest. To address the key issues limiting this success, this project will develop an AI-driven, integrated protein structure and interaction network-based approach, MEDICASCY-X, that will predict disease associated proteins, identify the most effective protein targets to treat the disease and suggest effective, de-risked therapeutic strategies. MEDICASCY-X will be applied to improve drug discovery and precision medicine and will be validated by developing novel preclinical treatments for a variety of intractable diseases.",Interplay of inherent promiscuity and specificity in protein biochemical function with applications to drug discovery and exome analysis,10149528,R35GM118039,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Explosion', 'Free Energy', 'Genetic', 'Geometry', 'Human', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Ligands', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Network-based', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'cryptic protein', 'deep learning', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'exome', 'gain of function', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIGMS,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2021,490958
"Molecular modeling and machine learning for protein structures and interactions PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Structural biology provides a powerful lens through which to view living systems. With advances in algorithms and computing, molecular simulations have begun to complement traditional experimental approaches as tools for discovery. At the same time, data-intensive machine learning approaches are becoming increasingly important in biology, fueled by the rapid growth in high-throughput experimentation. Research in my laboratory applies techniques from structural biology, molecular simulation, and machine learning to design new protein structures and predict protein interactions. We design new protein structures in order to better understand the principles of protein folding and to create highly stable and robust molecular scaffolds for a range of biomedical applications including multivalent display of binding or signaling domains, hosting of binding or catalytic sites, and use as building blocks to assemble higher-order complexes. We predict protein interactions in order to better understand the principles of macromolecular recognition and to gain insight into the process by which the adaptive immune system discriminates self from non-self in the context of infectious and autoimmune diseases and cancer. Our research during the project period will be directed toward two broad goals: de novo design and functionalization of tandem repeat proteins, and prediction of peptide-MHC recognition by T cell receptors (TCRs). The proposed protein design work builds on our recent progress designing circular tandem repeat proteins with a range of repeat numbers and diameters and applying these designs as multivalent display scaffolds for the presentation of binding and signalling domains. Our TCR studies leverage the tools we have recently developed to model—structurally and bioinformatically—repertoires of T cell receptors and their peptide:MHC specificity. Looking ahead, I am optimistic that by combining atomically-detailed molecular simulations and data-intensive machine learning techniques we will be able to generate designed protein constructs and predictive algorithms that have a significant positive impact on human health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop new computer algorithms for designing protein structures and predicting protein interactions. The rationally designed proteins that we create will have potential uses as molecular scaffolds in a wide range of biomedical applications including diagnostics and cellular therapies. By predicting the interactions between T cell receptors and antigens, we aim to better understand how the immune system discriminates self from non-self in the context of infectious and autoimmune disease and cancer.",Molecular modeling and machine learning for protein structures and interactions,10191763,R35GM141457,"['Adaptive Immune System', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Caliber', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Therapy', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Machines', 'Organism', 'Peptide/MHC Complex', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'design', 'insight', 'lens', 'molecular modeling', 'prediction algorithm', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'rapid growth', 'scaffold', 'simulation', 'structural biology', 'tool']",NIGMS,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R35,2021,291907
"Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Title: Accelerating Site-specific Characterization of Protein Therapeutics with Novel Machine Learning Methods The project seeks to improve reliability and speed up the development of life-saving and life-enhancing, precision, protein therapeutics and magnify the positive impact of biomedical research and education worldwide, leading to a quantum leap in our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways and mechanisms involved in healthy and diseased biological systems. The development of biologics is bottlenecked across the entire drug development process, from discovery to early stage candidate selection, process development and manufacturing, due to manual intervention in the mass spectrometry data analysis pipeline. Similarly, the proteomics research community is hindered as it moves from analysis of complex mixtures to more in-depth characterization of proteins and their modifications. Novel machine learning methods will be added to MassMatrix’s (LC-MS/MS software) proven analytical engine and visualization platform to minimize the loss of true positive peptide spectral matches. An innovative approach for efficient accountability of experimental data at the chromatogram level will also be researched, developed and added. The latter providing for easy traceability of each peak’s status in the chromatogram as soon as possible, thus providing convenient high-level assessment. Together, these aims are expected to improve the reliability and accuracy of results as well as to significantly reduce the mass spec bottleneck for the pharmaceutical industry and the research community. Deeper understanding and better decision making will follow, both having a potentially dramatic positive impact on downstream processes and resource deployment, including improved drug safety and efficacy.

"Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies Almost all proteins function through interacting with other proteins. Previous studies have shown that the vast majority of damaging single amino acid mutations in proteins disrupt only a subset of specific protein-protein interactions, and that mutations in the same protein that disrupt different interactions tend to cause clinically distinct disorders. Therefore, it is of great importance to determine interaction-specific disruptions caused by each mutation. Furthermore, rapid advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the identification of tens of millions of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the human population, driving an urgent need to understand the impact of each SNV on the human interactome network. Unfortunately, there is currently no method that is capable of predicting the specific impact of a large fraction of these SNVs on individual protein-protein interactions. To address this issue, we propose to leverage our massively-parallel site-directed mutagenesis pipeline, Clone-seq, to generate clones for ~6,000 coding SNVs in the human population: ~4,000 from gnomAD and ~2,000 to be submitted by the international human genetics community. We will then experimentally examine the impact on protein stability and individual protein-protein interactions for every variant using high-throughput DUAL-FLUO and InPOINT (integrating PCA, LUMIER, Y2H, and wNAPPA) assays. This proposal brings together three groups with complementary expertise in high-throughput interactome experiments and network analysis from the Yu lab, in genomic and population genetic studies from the Clark lab, and in comprehensive biophysical and structural modeling of mutation’s impact on binding free energy of protein interactions from the Alexov lab. Out of the ~6,000 SNVs, we expect to identify ~1,200 disruptive SNVs and ~4,000 different SNV-interaction pairs where the SNV disrupt that specific interaction. The data produced by our project will increase the available experimental information by >140× in number of human proteins and >500× in number of interactions, allowing us for the first time to comprehensively assess the relationships between the impact of SNVs on interactions and their various population genetic attributes (including, but not limited to, allele frequency and flanking haplotype, inter-population differentiation, local rate of recombination, allele age, modes of selection). Finally, we will establish a computational-experimental- integrated iterative learning scheme to build a multi-layer random-forest-based framework, SIMPACT, which can accurately predict specific impacts on all individual protein-protein interactions for all missense SNVs. Our proposed work will fuel hypothesis-driven research, will significantly improve our functional understanding of variants, and will likely fundamentally change the experimental design and data interpretation for whole genome/exome studies going forward. The dramatic increase of DNA variants discovered through advances in sequencing technologies has been inadequately translated into therapeutic successes. Although many of these variants are related to human disorders, the overwhelming number of non-functional variants makes the assessment of functional significance a steep challenge. In this study, we aim to develop a high-throughput pipeline to quickly clone and directly test a large number of coding variants for their impact on the human interactome network and use the results to build a machine learning pipeline to predict functional impact of all coding variants, in anticipation that both our experimental data and computational pipeline will lead to broad clinical and therapeutic applications.",Quantifying molecular consequences of human missense variants with large-scale interactome perturbation studies,10085248,R01GM125639,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Free Energy', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Haplotypes', 'Homology Modeling', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Scheme', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical techniques', 'computational pipelines', 'data pipeline', 'exome', 'experimental study', 'human interactome', 'improved', 'interest', 'molecular phenotype', 'mutant', 'next generation sequencing', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'random forest', 'screening', 'success', 'web portal', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,563248
"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,10152659,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,556806
"Distance-based ab initio protein structure prediction Project Summary Predicting the three-dimensional structures of proteins without using known structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as templates (ab initio) remains a grand challenge of computational biology. Whereas template-based modeling is now a mature field, ab initio modeling is a comparatively nascent one, especially for large proteins with complex topologies and multiple domains. The need for advances in ab initio modeling is evident. A lot of protein sequences do not have (recognizable) templates in the PDB, and the pace of experimental structure determination is incommensurate with the scale of the problem. Herein, we propose a new approach to ab initio modeling that consists of novel deep learning architectures to predict inter- residue distances and domain boundaries as well as robust, iterative optimization methods to construct tertiary structures from the predicted distances. This project builds on the success of our current R01, particularly the outstanding performance of the Cheng group in the 2018 worldwide protein structure prediction experiment – CASP13 – where our MULTICOM suite ranked among the top three tertiary structure predictors, alongside Google DeepMind’s AlphaFold. The methods will be implemented as open-source tools for the emerging field of distance-based ab initio protein structure modeling. We will apply the methods to study protein homo-oligomers and self-assemblies, based on our novel discovery that the quaternary structure contacts within homo-oligomers can be predicted by deep learning methods from the co-evolutionary signals embedded in multiple sequence alignments of protein monomers. Furthermore, we will apply the methods to predict the folds, functional sites, superfamilies, and protein-protein interactions of proteins that contain “essential Domains of Unknown Function” (eDUFs), a group of evolutionarily conserved, essential proteins that represents an important uncharted region of protein function/fold space. The predictions for a diverse and representative subset of eDUFs will be experimentally validated through a unique collaboration with the structural biology group of Dr. Tanner. Project Narrative Three-dimensional protein structure information is indispensable in modern biomedical research, but experimental techniques will only resolve a small fraction of known proteins due to the considerable cost. This project will develop cutting-edge computational methods based on modern artificial intelligence (AI) technology to reliably predict protein structures from sequence information alone.

"NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins Project summary Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for the study structure, dynamics and function of proteins in near-native conditions. NMR studies have vital implications for therapeutic development. However, as the number of amino acids in the protein increases, NMR signals decay (relax) faster, yielding lower sensitivity and resolution, while the spectrum becomes more crowded. In these cases it is challenging to match observed signals to specific nuclei in the protein (called `resonance assignment') in order to meaningfully interpret NMR data. The overarching goal of our research is to push the boundaries of NMR enabling valuable insight about the dynamics and functions of currently intractable proteins. The objective of this project is to design an NMR platform consisting of coordinated, next-generation biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques. Our platform is built around an original approach to NMR spectroscopy in which new information about the local environment of each nucleus is encoded in the shape and pattern of its NMR signal. The rationale is that these patterns are a `fingerprint' – an intricate and unique signature that encodes key information about which atom is responsible for each resonance peak in the NMR spectrum. We will design and realize fingerprint patterns using two innovative approaches: 1) biochemically, by selectively introducing NMR-active isotopes into carefully chosen positions in the protein samples, and biophysically, and 2) by using specialized radiofrequency pulses to accurately control the quantum interactions that determine the NMR spectrum. The resulting fingerprints will be decoded using established algorithmic structures from machine learning, notably artificial neural networks. This will facilitate automated analyses that are accessible to non-NMR specialists. Our approach to spectroscopy holds promise in the study of therapeutically important proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors and glycosylated proteins). Current NMR data from such proteins shows clear dynamics and interactions with other proteins, but cannot yet be properly interpreted because of the difficulty of relating each NMR peak to an amino acid in the protein sequence. Our platform will deliver two significant outcomes: 1) NMR resonance assignment for meaningful analyses of previously intractable systems. 2) Enable non-NMR specialists, to easily proceed from expressing their protein sample to using NMR to study dynamics and interactions via assigned spectra. This will have a positive impact on protein science and medical research. To support our mission we have assembled a team of leading experts to test our platform with their own protein systems. Project Narrative Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to study the structure, function, interactions, and dynamics of proteins, with important implications for therapeutic development. However, interpreting NMR information is extremely challenging and labor intensive, especially for large proteins, which produce many overlapping, weak NMR signals. We are developing next-generation methods in which key information is more clearly visible and accessible in the NMR data, using a highly coordinated platform of emerging biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques.","NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins",10392661,R01GM136859,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biophysics', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Computational Technique', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Fingerprint', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Isotopes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'artificial neural network', 'automated analysis', 'design', 'innovation', 'insight', 'next generation', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'radio frequency', 'therapeutic development']",NIGMS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,13250
"Center for Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) PROJECT SUMMARY  Experimental determination of protein structure often provides atomic accuracy models, but is inherently time- consuming, often costly, and not always possible. Computational modeling is currently less accurate, but offers an alternative approach when experimental results are not available. The goal of CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) is to advance the protein structure modeling field by conducting community-wide experiments that objectively determine the strengths and weaknesses of current methods and so foster progress. Approximately 100 research groups world-wide participate. In the most recent experiment (2018), there were 57,000 submissions in nine modeling categories, including over 35,000 tertiary structure models. The Center provides the infrastructure for CASP and Aim 1 is the continued development and operation of this resource. Principal tasks include registration and communication with participants; solicitation, characterization, and management of modeling targets; collection and validation of models; and extensive numerical analysis of submissions. These operations are supported by a secure and robust data infrastructure. The Center also develops evaluation, analysis, and display software, and provides access to models and evaluation results. CASP relies on independent assessors, experts in modeling or a related experimental field, to interpret the results. The Center coordinates this process, providing evaluation data and, when necessary, implementing new evaluation methods.  Recent CASPs have shown dramatic improvements in model accuracy, especially for the most difficult cases where homology modeling cannot be used. A major factor driving progress is the use of new machine learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks. These and related methods appear poised to make further major advances in a number of key modeling areas. The plan for the next period of the project is designed to capitalize on these and other opportunities for progress. Greater success with modeling small proteins and domains dictates a shift in emphasis to the still challenging area of large multi-domain proteins and complexes (Aim 2), where progress is expected both from the machine learning developments and from the incorporation of sparse experimental data. Although accuracy of models has improved, it is still seldom competitive with experiment. Aim 3 is to pursue strategies that will make models more accurate and useful, by nurturing further progress in refining initial models, better methods for estimating model accuracy, and assessment of the utility of models. Aim 4 introduces new ways of strengthening interactions between CASP and the broader research community, providing models that directly address contemporary problems (for example, for CoV-2 protein structures) and boosting communications through meetings, webinars, publications and other means. PROJECT NARRATIVE Knowledge of macromolecular structure plays a crucial role in biology and medicine, allowing for detailed studies and understanding of biological processes and disease mechanisms. Yet, relatively few structures are obtained experimentally - the rest must be modeled.

"Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs Abstract:  Recombinant protein expression technology has revolutionized human health research, enabling scientists to generate large quantities of protein for small-molecule drug discovery campaigns, for the development of protein-based drugs, and for studying protein structure and function. Yet while researchers are adept at producing proteins with known genetic sequences, they possess entirely inadequate knowledge about the protein's post-translational modifications, both during recombinant expression and when the proteins are isolated from endogenous sources. Alterations in a protein's post-translational modifications can change the protein from an active enzyme to a dead one; they can change a protein-based drug from a life-saving molecule to one that is either ineffective or worse, dangerously immunogenic; these seemingly simple “add- ons” to proteins can be the defining features that determine whether the protein functions as designed or not. Characterizing proteins' PTMs is a necessary prerequisite for identifying disease states, modulating protein binding and function, and producing safe and effective protein-based drugs and vaccines. The long term goals of my research program are to expedite the analysis of post-translational modifications (PTMs) on proteins, to use these analytical tools to answer critical health-related challenges, and to widely distribute the technology. We are pursuing both near-term advancements, such as developing a robust solution to quantifying aberrant disulfide bonds in recombinant proteins, as well as long-range, revolutionary changes in the way proteins are analyzed, by laying the foundational infrastructure needed to bring artificial intelligence solutions to the field of PTM analysis. We will develop and launch these technologies in the context of meaningful biological problems where field advancements cannot be made without information about proteins' PTMs. Solutions in the fields of HIV vaccine design, cancer treatment, and antibody therapy will be targeted first. Project Narrative:  Rapid, precision tools are needed to assess and quantify proteins' post-translational modifications (PTMs); such tools will drive the production of optimal proteins and enable the detection of disease biomarkers. We will make the necessary tools, distribute them widely, and use them to solve key problems in a number of disease contexts.",Mass Spectrometry Measurements for Complex PTMs,10083746,R35GM130354,"['Antibody Therapy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Complex', 'Dangerousness', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'HIV vaccine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Post Translational Modification Analysis', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Production', 'Protein Analysis', 'Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'design', 'disulfide bond', 'drug discovery', 'immunogenic', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'protein function', 'protein structure function', 'small molecule', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R35,2021,377124
"NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins Project summary Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is essential for the study structure, dynamics and function of proteins in near-native conditions. NMR studies have vital implications for therapeutic development. However, as the number of amino acids in the protein increases, NMR signals decay (relax) faster, yielding lower sensitivity and resolution, while the spectrum becomes more crowded. In these cases it is challenging to match observed signals to specific nuclei in the protein (called `resonance assignment') in order to meaningfully interpret NMR data. The overarching goal of our research is to push the boundaries of NMR enabling valuable insight about the dynamics and functions of currently intractable proteins. The objective of this project is to design an NMR platform consisting of coordinated, next-generation biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques. Our platform is built around an original approach to NMR spectroscopy in which new information about the local environment of each nucleus is encoded in the shape and pattern of its NMR signal. The rationale is that these patterns are a `fingerprint' – an intricate and unique signature that encodes key information about which atom is responsible for each resonance peak in the NMR spectrum. We will design and realize fingerprint patterns using two innovative approaches: 1) biochemically, by selectively introducing NMR-active isotopes into carefully chosen positions in the protein samples, and biophysically, and 2) by using specialized radiofrequency pulses to accurately control the quantum interactions that determine the NMR spectrum. The resulting fingerprints will be decoded using established algorithmic structures from machine learning, notably artificial neural networks. This will facilitate automated analyses that are accessible to non-NMR specialists. Our approach to spectroscopy holds promise in the study of therapeutically important proteins expressed in eukaryotic expression systems (e.g. G-protein coupled receptors and glycosylated proteins). Current NMR data from such proteins shows clear dynamics and interactions with other proteins, but cannot yet be properly interpreted because of the difficulty of relating each NMR peak to an amino acid in the protein sequence. Our platform will deliver two significant outcomes: 1) NMR resonance assignment for meaningful analyses of previously intractable systems. 2) Enable non-NMR specialists, to easily proceed from expressing their protein sample to using NMR to study dynamics and interactions via assigned spectra. This will have a positive impact on protein science and medical research. To support our mission we have assembled a team of leading experts to test our platform with their own protein systems. Project Narrative Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is used to study the structure, function, interactions, and dynamics of proteins, with important implications for therapeutic development. However, interpreting NMR information is extremely challenging and labor intensive, especially for large proteins, which produce many overlapping, weak NMR signals. We are developing next-generation methods in which key information is more clearly visible and accessible in the NMR data, using a highly coordinated platform of emerging biochemical, biophysical, mathematical, and computational techniques.","NMR Fingerprinting: Leveraging optimal control pulse design, tailored isotope labeling, and machine learning to study intractable proteins",10159285,R01GM136859,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Models', 'Biophysics', 'COSY', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Chemicals', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'Crowding', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Drug Design', 'Environment', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Goals', 'HMQC', 'Hour', 'Investigation', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Isotopes', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Mainstreaming', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Weight', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Pyruvate', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'TOCSY', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vertebral column', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'artificial neural network', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'control theory', 'cost', 'design', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'methyl group', 'next generation', 'nonlinear regression', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nuclear power', 'protein function', 'quantum', 'radio frequency', 'reconstruction', 'therapeutic development']",NIGMS,DANA-FARBER CANCER INST,R01,2021,445749
"Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions Protein-peptide interactions are prevalent in many cellular processes, such as signal transduction, transcription regulation, and immune response. Peptide-based therapeutics have attracted much attention in recent years, and a significantly growing number of peptide-based medicines have been designed and approved for a variety of diseases. Therefore, studying protein-peptide interactions is of great significance for mechanistic investigation of many biological processes and for peptide therapeutic development. However, because of the difficulties and cost for determining such structures by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, currently there are only a limited number of protein-peptide complex structures in the Protein Data Bank. Thus, the ability to predict protein- peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. However, structure prediction for protein-peptide complexes is challenging, particularly due to peptide flexibility. In this project, we will address this challenging issue by innovative integration of bioinformatics and physical modeling approaches. Specifically, we propose to achieve four goals: Goal #1: We will develop novel deep-learning models for protein-peptide structure prediction. Despite successful application of deep learning to protein structure prediction and protein-ligand interaction, deep learning has not been applied to protein-peptide structure prediction yet, due to the flexibility and the resulting large degrees of freedom in peptides. Goal #2: We will develop the first in silico screening method for the search of peptide-based inhibitors, and will construct novel peptide libraries for screening. Our in silico method will be an attractive complement to valuable experimental technologies such as phage display and yeast two-hybrid system for rapid peptide screening at much lower cost. Goal #3: We will convert our computational algorithms into a modular, extensible, open-source software package that can be disseminated to the computational modeling community at no cost. Goal #4. As a proof-of-concept application of our in silico screening method, we will screen for novel peptide leads by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance, in collaboration with my experimental collaborator whose expertise is in molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology. The ability to predict protein-peptide complex structures will have a far-reaching impact on understanding important biological processes and on designing therapeutic interventions. We propose to tackle the challenge of protein- peptide structure prediction, including developing the first in silico peptide screening method to dramatically save cost and time. We will screen for peptide inhibitors by targeting β-lactamase to combat antibiotic resistance.",Structure prediction and in silico screening of protein-peptide interactions,10145049,R35GM136409,"['Address', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Attention', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Cell physiology', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Disease', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Immune response', 'Investigation', 'Ligands', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Peptide Library', 'Peptides', 'Phage Display', 'Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'beta-Lactamase', 'combat', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'flexibility', 'in silico', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'novel', 'open source', 'peptide drug', 'peptide structure', 'physical model', 'protein data bank', 'protein structure prediction', 'screening', 'therapeutic development', 'yeast two hybrid system']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2021,383330
"Development of a pipeline for parallel elucidation of protein structures Advances in biophysical technologies have accelerated our ability to probe the mechanisms of even the most complex cellular systems, and such studies have enabled researchers to design modifications to known protein structures and design completely new proteins. This “protein design” technology has given rise to an ability to manipulate protein structures as a means of improving on or introducing new medical diagnostics and therapeutics. The bases of these studies rely on computational modeling of protein candidates, although the accuracy of protein structure prediction, protein de novo design, and single-mutation effects prediction remain below the threshold for many use cases, such as structure-guided drug design and rational enzyme engineering. Thus, success of a protein engineering effort relies on high-resolution structure determination, which involves laborious screening and optimization in order to obtain stable proteins or active enzyme variants. However, our ability to observe protein structure using common structure determination strategies (X-ray crystallography, NMR, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)) lags far behind our ability to design and produce new sequences, creating a knowledge gap that prevents biochemists from accessing the range of protein functions seen in nature. While current technologies enable rapid synthesis of hundreds of proteins with varied sequences, there do not exist technologies for rapid structural characterization of these generated proteins. The ability to obtain high- resolution structural information for hundreds of sequences in parallel would provide invaluable insights in protein engineering methods. Importantly, rapid structure determination would enable structural characterization of genetic variation in the human genome underlying disease by enabling the structural and mechanistic interpretation of rare and de novo disease-related variants. Cryo-EM enables numerous high-resolution structures to be determined from a small amount of sample without requiring homogeneity, an aspect of this method that we plan to exploit for parallel elucidation of protein structures. We will establish the feasibility of this technique for rapidly investigate the structures of engineered protein libraries, where the molecular weight range is near or below the lower detection limit of cryo-EM. We will also probe the limits of our ability to identify the location and structural impact of tested mutations at limited structural locations, such as active sites. We will explore the feasibility of our parallel structure determination approach in two aims: Aim 1 will identify the limit of current single-particle analysis methods to discriminate between structurally similar protein complexes. Aim 2 will implement machine learning algorithms to push the current limits of classification using a combination of synthetic and real data. These exploratory studies will pave the way to rapid structure determination of multiple protein complexes from a single cryo-EM experiment, providing the ability to rapidly obtain high-resolution structures for many engineered proteins, thereby enabling unprecedented design and testing feedback cycles to help treat human disease. Narrative Our understanding of structure-function relationships has matured to the point that we can now manipulate the composition of proteins as a means of producing diagnostics or therapeutics for human disease. However, in order to fully elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of function that drive these protein design studies, structures of the designed proteins must be determined. However, structure determination is a massive bottleneck, which we plan to overcome by establishing a platform for massively parallelized structure determination of protein targets that is commensurate with the rate of protein production involved in protein design studies.",Development of a pipeline for parallel elucidation of protein structures,10231713,R21GM142196,"['Active Sites', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biophysics', 'Biotechnology', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallography', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Engineering', 'Enzymes', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Genetic Variation', 'Heart', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Weight', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Nature', 'Performance', 'Preparation', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protein Biochemistry', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'classification algorithm', 'de novo mutation', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detection limit', 'experimental study', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'particle', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'rapid technique', 'screening', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'variant of unknown significance']",NIGMS,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2021,221875
"Investigation of ssDNA binding proteins and protein-ssDNA interactions Project Summary/Abstract Molecular interactions between proteins and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) play crucial roles in many fundamental biological processes, such as DNA replication, DNA recombination, DNA repair, gene regulation, and genome stability. ssDNA-binding proteins encompass various degrees of binding specificity, ranging from highly specific to non-specific. Despite the critical roles of protein-ssDNA interactions in essential biological processes, the investigation of protein-ssDNA interactions lags far behind other types of protein-nucleic acids interactions, such as protein-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) interaction. Currently there are no comprehensive, well-annotated resources for studying protein- ssDNA interactions. This proposal aims to investigate the mechanism of protein-ssDNA interactions by first constructing well-annotated protein-ssDNA data resources and by performing comparative analysis at two different levels. The first is to compare structural features between protein-ssDNA complexes with different binding specificity. The second is to investigate the similarity/differences between protein- ssDNA and protein-dsDNA complexes. In addition, we propose to predict novel ssDNA binding proteins from the unannotated protein sequences by combining structure-based protein threading methods and sequence-based machine learning approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal aims to build comprehensive data resources for studying complexes between protein and single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and to investigate the structure and function of ssDNA binding proteins. Protein-ssDNA interaction is critical in many biological processes and plays essential roles in maintaining genome integrity, promoting genome stability and transcription regulation.

"Unlocking sequence-structure-function-disease relationships in large protein super-families Project Summary Predicting disease phenotypes from genotypes is a grand challenge in biology and personalized medicine. Our long-term goal is to address this challenge using a combination of computational and experimental approaches. Working towards this goal, we have developed and deployed a powerful evolutionary systems approach to map the complex relationships connecting sequence, structure, function, regulation and disease in biomedically important protein super-families such as protein kinases. We have made important contributions describing the unique modes of allosteric regulation in various protein kinases, deciphering the structural basis of oncogenic activation in a subset of receptor tyrosine kinases, uncovering the regulation of pseudokinases, and developing new tools and resources for addressing data integration challenges in the signaling field. We propose to build on these impactful studies to answer key questions emanating from our ongoing studies such as: What are the functions of pseudokinases, the catalytically-inert members of the kinome, and how can we use pseudokinases to better predict and characterize non-catalytic functions of kinases? What are the functions of conserved cysteine residues in regulatory sites of protein and small molecule kinases and are they post-translationally modified in redox signaling and oxidative stress response that are causally associated with age-related disorders? How can we enhance existing computational models for predicting genome-phenome relationships using structural information, and can machine learning on structurally enhanced knowledge graphs reveal new relationships between patient-derived mutations and disease phenotypes? We propose to answer these questions using a variety of approaches including statistical mining of large sequence datasets, molecular dynamics simulations, machine learning, mass spectrometry, biochemical analysis and in vivo assays. Completion of this work is expected to reveal new allosteric sites for targeting pseudokinase and kinase non-catalytic functions in diseases, and significantly advance our understanding of kinase regulatory mechanisms in disease and normal states. Our work will create new tools and resources for knowledge graph mining and provide explainable models for inferring causal relationships linking genomes and phenomes with potential applications in personalized medicine. Finally, the scope and impact of our work will be significantly broadened by participation in studies extending our specialized tools and technological approaches developed for the study of kinases to other biomedically important gene families such as glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases. Project Narrative Many human diseases including cancer, diabetes, and inflammatory disorders are causally associated with abnormal protein kinase and glycosyltransferase functions.

"Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens Project Summary  Characterizing the functions of protein-coding genes is an important goal in the post-genomic era. While proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions, including those mis-regulated in disease, we have an extremely limited understanding of the roles of the majority of proteins in the human proteome. Though powerful, existing technologies for the high-throughput interrogation of protein-coding genes, including CRISPR/Cas9-based approaches and RNA interference, require extended periods of time to effect changes in protein levels, and thus suffer two critical shortcomings. First, they are unable to detect the contribution of growth- essential genes to any cellular process other than viability, as any cell carrying a perturbation in such a gene would fail to propagate. Second, compensatory and adaptive effects have ample opportunity to manifest, thus convoluting screen results by ameliorating the effect of the perturbation, or by generating a novel, unrelated effect. To address these critical limitations, I propose to develop a new screening technology that will minimize the time between perturbation and screen readout by inducibly and rapidly degrading endogenous proteins. This is made possible by a readily scalable endogenous tagging technology that harnesses homology-independent targeted integration to insert a synthetic exon into the intron of a protein-coding gene at the site of a double strand break. The synthetic exon will encode a multifunctional ligand-binding protein that depending on the ligand, will lead to fluorescence or rapid degradation. Pooled libraries of sgRNAs targeting different introns allows for the creation of custom libraries of cells, where each cell carries this multifunctional tag on a different protein. The utility of this approach will be established aims 1 and 2 by testing (1) whether cells that have undergone rapid depletion of growth-essential proteins are maintained in the cell library at the end of the short perturbation window and (2) whether rapid depletion and CRISPR knockout at the same protein produce different effects on a well-established phenotype, due to the distorting effects of adaptation events in the knockout. Aim 3 witnesses the use of a machine learning approach and the data from thousands of attempted tagging events to identify how the features of a potential tag site dictate the likelihood that a functional protein carrying the multifunctional tag will be produced. The resulting model will be unleashed on the protein-coding genome to predict high-quality tag sites for as many protein-coding genes as possible. This will establish an improved screening paradigm that will allow for the pooled interrogation of the contributions of thousands of proteins to a phenotype of interest, will thus accelerate the rate at which we come to understand the poorly understood elements of the protein-coding genome. These efforts will be well supported by the outstanding resources for experimentation and mentorship at both the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, and will provide excellent training in experimental techniques for protein perturbation and characterization, as well computational literacy in the broadly useful field of machine learning. Project Narrative  Proteins are the ultimate effectors of most cellular functions in health and disease. Yet, the functions of the majority proteins encoded by the human genome are very poorly understood. A novel high-throughput screening strategy leveraging rapid protein degradation will dramatically accelerate functional characterization of the human proteome.",Coupling a multifunctional tag to scalable endogenous tagging technology for improved genome-wide perturbation screens,10268980,F31HG011185,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cell division', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Coupling', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA lesion', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Essential Genes', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Inclusion Bodies', 'Introns', 'Investigation', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publishing', 'RNA Interference', 'Reporter', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Screening Result', 'Shunt Device', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'base', 'blind', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'fitness', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'high throughput technology', 'improved', 'interest', 'knockout gene', 'literacy', 'mutant', 'novel', 'protein degradation', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2021,33463
