"Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate is an epileptologist and neuroscientist at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and Harvard Medical School, whose long-term career goal is to become an independent- ly funded translational investigator with expertise at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases. Patients with neurodegenerative diseases are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and patients with epilepsy often suffer from cognitive co-morbidities. The ability to translate the clinical experience, research tools, and intellectual framework from the field of epilepsy to that of the neurodegenerative diseases, and vice versa, could be a powerful approach to studying both processes. During the proposed training period, the candidate will combine her prior training in epilepsy, EEG signal processing, and machine learning, with newly acquired skills in neuroimaging (functional MRI), biostatistics, and additional clinical exposure to patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Under the mentorship of Dr. Sydney Cash, an expert in epilepsy and neurophysiologic signal processing, and the co-mentorship of Dr. Reisa Sperling, an expert in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and neuroimaging approaches, the candidate proposes to: 1) Delineate the spectrum of epileptiform activity in early stages of AD and develop computa- tional tools to identify this activity; 2) Establish the pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie epileptiform activity in AD; and 3) Determine how epileptiform abnormalities are associated with cognitive trajectories in patients with early stage AD. Visual and computational analysis of 24- hour scalp EEGs will be integrated with resting-state and task-based fMRI measurements, amy- loid PET imaging, and longitudinal cognitive testing from subjects with AD, to develop a com- prehensive understanding of the role of epileptiform abnormalities in early stages of AD. In addi- tion to the research proposed, the candidate’s career development plan entails rigorous coursework and seminars, practical hands-on experience, and close guidance from a board of academic advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow the candidate to establish a clinical and research niche at the boundary between epilepsy and the neurodegenerative diseases, and to develop a comprehensive toolbox with which to probe human brain function from the standpoint of neurophysiology, structure, connectivity, and tar- geted pathology. Collectively, these will form the foundation for a successful career as an inde- pendent investigator pursuing important clinical and translational research projects to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with epilepsy, neurodegenerative diseases, or both. Project Narrative People with Alzheimer’s disease are at increased risk of developing epilepsy, and people with epilepsy commonly suffer from impairments in memory and cognition. Our goals are to better understand the interplay between epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease, and to determine whether epileptiform activity may be a treatable contributor to cognitive decline in people with Alzheimer’s disease. This has important public health implications, as according to the Alzheimer’s Association, a treatment that slows the rate of progression of Alzheimer’s disease by five-fold would reduce the number of people with severe Alzheimer’s disease from 6.5 million to 1.2 million and reduce Medicare costs by 50% by the year 2050.",Exploring the role of epileptiform activity in Alzheimer's Disease,10130638,K23NS101037,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scalp structure', 'Scientist', 'Senile Plaques', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Technical Expertise', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Visual', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'falls', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,200880
"Thalamocortical Responsive Neurostimulation for the Treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome Project Summary / Abstract  Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a devastating form of childhood onset epilepsy with cognitive dysfunction and very frequent generalized onset seizures (GOS) often leading to injury. Driven by the lack of effective therapies and the demonstrated safety and efficacy of brain-responsive stimulation for medically intractable focal onset seizures (FOS), this study will test whether brain-responsive neurostimulation of thalamocortical networks (RNS-TCN) is a feasible strategy to treat LGS. Specifically, the project aims to: (1) acquire preliminary evidence for safety and efficacy in treating GOS of LGS with RNS-TCN; (2) create an interactive therapy-decision support system based on patient-specific computational network models and machine learning to identify optimal lead placement and stimulation parameters.  Using the RNS® System, which is FDA approved for FOS, an early feasibility IDE study will be conducted at 6 epilepsy centers in 20 patients with LGS and medically intractable GOS. The patients will be enrolled in two cohorts of 10, with safety and efficacy milestones in the first cohort governing the enrollment of the second cohort. Patients will have two depth leads placed bilaterally in the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus and two subdural strip leads placed bilaterally on the medial prefrontal cortex. These targets are selected because they are implicated in the onset and spread of GOS in LGS. Leads will be located within each target such that stimulation maximally engages the thalamocortical network, guided by finite-element biophysical models created from structural magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion weighted imaging. The finite-element biophysical models will also be used to identify the initial RNS-TCN stimulation pathway and current amplitude. During the blinded evaluation period patients will be randomized to receive either high-frequency short burst (HFSB) or low-frequency long burst (LFLB) RNS-TCN, then enter a washout period before crossing over to receive the other treatment condition. During the open label period stimulation parameters can be modified at the discretion of the physician. Parameter adjustments will be informed by using a Bayesian optimization model developed for specifically for each patient. All clinical and electrophysiological data collected during the study will be used to identify a biomarker of clinical response; if found, these will aid future epilepsy research and clinical practice. If safety is favorable and there is preliminary evidence for efficacy, then this early experience will inform the design of a future larger feasibility study.  In addition to treating a population in need, this project engages in fundamental discovery of biomarkers in generalized network epilepsies, and develops novel automated therapy selection policies that have the potential to improve the lives of patients with LGS and other seizure disorders. Project Narrative Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (LGS) is a devastating form of childhood onset epilepsy characterized by cognitive dysfunction and very frequent generalized onset seizures (GOS) that often lead to injury. Driven by the lack of effective therapies and the demonstrated safety and efficacy of brain-responsive stimulation for treating medically intractable focal onset seizures, this study will test whether brain-responsive neurostimulation can also be used to treat LGS. The intent of the proposed research is to test the safety and preliminary efficacy of responsive neurostimulation of thalamocortical networks (RNS-TCN) involved in GOS, to identify promising detection and stimulation approaches, and to characterize neurophysiological biomarkers of clinical efficacy that will aid future research and clinical practice.",Thalamocortical Responsive Neurostimulation for the Treatment of Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome,9958791,UH3NS109557,"['12 year old', 'Adverse effects', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Brain', 'Centromedian Thalamic Nucleus', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clonic Seizure', 'Computer Models', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'FDA approved', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gastaut syndrome', 'Generalized Epilepsy', 'Genetic Crossing Over', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Implant', 'Injury', 'Ipsilateral', 'Lead', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medial', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Single-Blind Study', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tonic Seizures', 'Update', 'addiction', 'atonic seizure', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biophysical model', 'blind', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computational network modeling', 'design', 'diaries', 'early experience', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'interactive therapy', 'lead optimization', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'open label', 'potential biomarker', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'response', 'safety testing', 'tool']",NINDS,"NEUROPACE, INC.",UH3,2021,831388
"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools PROJECT SUMMARY  Epilepsy is one of the world’s most prevalent diseases, yet the rate of uncontrolled seizures has not changed in decades. One of the reasons for this is our limited understanding of seizure mechanisms, and so one of the main goals of epilepsy research is to identify new biomarkers to help us understand the nature of the disease. Recent technological advancements now allow us to monitor brain activity with much higher resolution, which have led to the identification of promising potential biomarkers such as High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs). Unfortunately, clinicians still have not determined how to utilize this information under clinical conditions. There are three main obstacles to implementing HFOs in practice: 1) they are difficult to find; 2) it is unclear how to ascertain which HFOs are truly related to epilepsy; and 3) it is unclear how to use the HFO data in a prospective fashion to improve clinical care. The purpose of this project is overcome each of these obstacles. In the past funding period, we developed and validated an HFO detection algorithm that overcomes the first obstacle, and allowed us acquire a massive database of HFOs that have opened new avenues of research. In this proposal, we will leverage that algorithm to move HFOs towards clinical translation. In the first Aim, we apply advanced functional connectivity techniques to quantify the network properties of HFOs. Our data, which comprise HFOs from the entire hospitalization and fully curated metadata, are ideal for robust analyses of this new area of HFO research. The second Aim addresses a longstanding, and still unsolved problem in HFO research: how to discern when HFOs are due to epileptic processes versus normal physiology? Our past funding period identified some potential methods to identify pathological HFOs, but also crucial caveats that must be addressed prior to clinical implementation. This Aim will combine multiple classification methods with state-of-the-art machine learning tools to distinguish epileptic from normal HFOs. It will also conduct a large human expert classification of HFOs using clinical EEG software, to start involving epilepsy clinicians in the direct evaluation of HFOs. The third Aim will further develop the translational potential of HFOs, incorporating our unique longitudinal clinical data to characterize the effects of medications, sleep, and other time-varying effects on HFO rates. It will then incorporate these and all prior HFO data into a rigorous latent class model to predict how likely each channel is to be epileptic. These Aims together serve as the framework to establish HFOs as a clinically viable biomarker of seizures, allowing their translation into clinical epilepsy care and leading to future prospective clinical studies using HFOs to guide prospective clinical decisions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to characterize a novel biomarker of seizures using advanced computer algorithms that monitor brainwaves in real time. These biomarkers, known as High Frequency Oscillations, have been recognized for some time but their research has been restricted to very short datasets within a handful of centers worldwide. This project will use Big Data tools to help translate these biomarkers into widespread use while exploring several novel ways in which they will help clinicians identify seizures.",Characterizing High Frequency Oscillations as an epilepsy biomarker with Big Data tools,10117719,R01NS094399,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Seizures', 'Sleep', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'potential biomarker', 'prospective', 'spatiotemporal', 'specific biomarkers', 'technology/technique', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,512781
"Interictal High Frequency Oscillations of Epileptogenecity in Pediatric Patients Project Summary Crucial to the success of epilepsy surgery is the availability of a robust presurgical biomarker to identify the epileptogenic zone (EZ). Complete resection of the EZ may lead to medication and seizure freedom. Since the EZ cannot be measured directly, its location is estimated indirectly based on concordant data from a multitude of noninvasive tests. Yet, the results of these tests are often insufficiently concordant or inconclusive. Intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) serves as the gold standard for the delineation of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). However, the SOZ does not always predict the surgical outcome, and its delineation requires many days of recordings to capture clinical seizures. High-frequency oscillations (HFOs), recorded with iEEG are promising interictal biomarkers of the EZ. Yet, their clinical value for epilepsy surgery is still debated since the HFO-generating area is often relatively large and its complete resection may overlap with eloquent areas. This is often attributed to the presence of physiological HFOs in non-epileptogenic areas. In our recent iEEG study, we showed that interictal HFOs are initiated by an onset generator and spread to other brain areas over time. This generator constitutes a promising interictal biomarker of the EZ since its resection is associated with good surgical outcome. Despite the copious literature on HFOs, the clinical value of HFOs for surgery has been only investigated using iEEG, which presents serious limitations due to its invasiveness and its limited spatial sampling. This application aims to noninvasively localize interictal HFOs with high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) in children with medically refractory epilepsy (MRE), distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs, and assess the noninvasive localization of the HFO-onset generator with respect to the surgical resection and patients’ outcome. Our hypothesis is that HD-EEG and MEG can distinguish pathological from physiological HFOs non-invasively and can localize the HFO-onset generator whose removal leads to better surgical outcome than the removal of the area of secondary spread. To test our hypothesis, we specifically aim to: (i) assess the ability of HD-EEG and MEG to localize HFOs; (ii) differentiate physiological (nHFOs) from pathological (pHFOs) HFOs using unsupervised machine learning; (iii) localize noninvasively the HFO-onset generator and compare it with the clinical gold standard for resection tailoring, i.e. the iEEG-defined SOZ; and (iv) assess the predictive value of the HFO- onset generator in terms of surgical outcome. To pursue these aims, we will record HD-EEG and MEG data from 50 children (0-18 years old) with MRE and 50 typically developing (TD) children. This application combines the use of cutting-edge pediatric neuroimaging instruments, 3D printing technology, and innovative signal processing tools together with extensive neuroimaging experience with children. Our research will have a direct impact on the life of children with MRE since it will provide a new noninvasive biomarker of the EZ that would limit invasive long-term monitoring, augment presurgical planning, and improve the surgical outcome. Narrative To lessen the negative impact of medically refractory epilepsy in children, a new pre-surgical noninvasive biomarker that identifies reliably the area of the brain that generates the epileptic seizures is essential. The proposed experiments are relevant to public health because they may lead to a significant improvement of the presurgical evaluation procedure and postsurgical outcome of pediatric patients with refractory epilepsy. The project is relevant to NINDS’s mission because the resulting findings could significantly improve the quality of life in children with epilepsy, one of the most common pediatric neurological disorders, which has a major impact on children’s development and may significantly affect their adult life.",Interictal High Frequency Oscillations of Epileptogenecity in Pediatric Patients,9944685,R01NS104116,"['18 year old', '3D Print', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Gold', 'Head', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'base', 'blind', 'density', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'signal processing', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'visual motor']",NINDS,COOK CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,428636
"EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy Project Summary Dr. Jennifer A. Kim is a critical care neurologist and neuroscientist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded translational investigator with expertise in signal processing of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging data to identify early biomarkers of secondary brain injury in critically ill patients, particularly related to post-traumatic epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a disabling complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of post-traumatic epilepsy to identify patients at high risk for developing this complication. It is a population in which early biomarker identification could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post- traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Post-traumatic epilepsy, a seizure disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI), is among the most disabling and difficult-to-treat complications of TBI. Currently, there are no tools to identify patients a priori at highest risk for PTE. Dr. Kim's proposed career development plan has great potential to advance our knowledge of the acute biomarkers of PTE using EEG and MRI, to improve early identification and ultimately provide treatment options for this potentially preventable complication.",EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10192851,K23NS112596,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blinded', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Complication', 'Contusions', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Prevention trial', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Rodent Model', 'Sclerosis', 'Secondary to', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'care costs', 'career', 'career development', 'cost estimate', 'didactic education', 'disability', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'human imaging', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'preventable epilepsy', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,191054
"Algorithm for the Real-Time Detection of Absence Seizures from Oculometric Data Abstract Eysz, Inc. is developing an algorithm and software solutions to reliably and affordably detect seizures in an ambulatory setting using existing smart glass technologies. In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. Lessons learned from this study will be applied (with different training sets) to additional seizures types, such as focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial) seizures, the most prevalent seizure type in adults. This work is of critical importance to the field, as demonstrated by support from the Epilepsy Foundation and receipt of both the judges' and people's choice awards in the Epilepsy Foundation's 8th Annual Shark Tank Competition. Narrative More than 70 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition that results in significant disability and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection and characterization is critical to choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can decrease seizures by 50%.

In a proof-of-concept study, Eysz was able to detect >75% of all absence seizures longer than 10 s in duration using only oculometric variables (e.g., pupil size, pupil location, eccentricity, blink frequency) detected using off-the-shelf eye-tracking technology. Eysz seeks to build on this finding by developing and commercializing highly sensitive and specific seizure detection algorithms using eye-movement data as input, with eventual expansion to additional seizure types. This technology has the potential to transform the detection and treatment of seizures for those with epilepsy, one of the most common neurological disorders worldwide. Timely treatment can reduce the chance of additional seizures by half, making early detection and treatment critical. Unfortunately, detection and diagnosis can be difficult using current technologies, especially in types of epilepsy with few observable symptoms such as absence seizures. The gold standard for detecting and characterizing seizure activity is electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring with video and subsequent review by a trained clinician, but this does not translate well to the outpatient setting. While attempts to develop ambulatory EEGs have been made, these have significant drawbacks, including poor patient acceptability, poor detection capability, and continued reliance on asynchronous review. Additional non-EEG- based motion detection devices are limited to tonic-clonic seizures, which are responsible for a small fraction of all seizure activity. Thus, there is a critical need to reliably detect seizures outside of the clinic to provide physicians with necessary information to guide therapeutic decision making. To address this need, Eysz is developing a digital health platform that leverages existing eye tracking technology to meet this significant unmet gap in the market and is technically feasible, capital-efficient, robust, and innovative. Eysz plans to use existing smart glass technology to export the necessary oculometric data to be analyzed by our seizure detection algorithm. We will also build out databases, software systems, and user interfaces enabling the resulting data to be stored in the cloud and visualized/analyzed by physicians. In this Phase I SBIR, Eysz will advance the development of the seizure detection algorithms by: 1) obtaining oculometric video and EEG data on ≥100 absence seizures from multiple patients, and 2) using ML and statistical methods to optimize an algorithm for identifying absence seizures using eye-tracking data, with a target sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 90%. Lessons learned from this study will be applied (with different training sets) to additional seizures types, such as focal impaired awareness (formerly called complex partial) seizures, the most prevalent seizure type in adults. This work is of critical importance to the field, as demonstrated by support from the Epilepsy Foundation and receipt of both the judges' and people's choice awards in the Epilepsy Foundation's 8th Annual Shark Tank Competition. Narrative More than 70 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition that results in significant disability and increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Seizure detection and characterization is critical to choosing an appropriate treatment regimen, and appropriate anticonvulsants can decrease seizures by 50%.

"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled. PROJECT NARRATIVE The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques as well as automatic clustering approaches based on quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution.

"Targeting pathologic spike-ripples to isolate and disrupt epileptic dynamics Project Summary Epilepsy is the world’s most common, serious brain disorder, affecting nearly 50 million people worldwide. For one-third of patients, seizures remain poorly controlled despite maximal medical management. In these patients, seizures often arise from a localized brain region, and neurosurgical interventions are the most effective treatment option. When successful, surgical interventions provide cure from seizures, and also prevent or reverse the disabling consequences of uncontrolled seizures. Critical to successful intervention is accurate identification of the core tissue responsible for generating seizures (i.e., the epileptogenic zone). Traditionally, this tissue would be surgically resected, but modern approaches aim to focally disrupt this tissue with targeted electrical stimulation (i.e. neuromodulation). Improvements in epilepsy care are now limited by (i) the inability to accurately identify the epileptogenic zone; (ii) a limited understanding of the mechanisms underlying epileptiform activity; (iii) a lack of understanding of how to target these mechanisms with neurostimulation. The most common approach to identify the epileptogenic zone is through continuous recording of a patient’s cortical electrical activity to capture seizures. However, because seizures are infrequent, this approach is expensive, time consuming, and unpleasant for patients. Moreover, this approach often fails to identify the epileptogenic zone, resulting in unsuccessful neurosurgical intervention in 20-70% of cases. To address this, interictal biomarkers of the epileptogenic zone that manifest between seizures are required. Two such biomarkers have been proposed: (a) interictal discharges or spikes, and (b) high frequency oscillations or ripples. While both signals have been extensively studied, neither accurately delimits the epileptogenic zone. Spikes are specific for epilepsy, but too spatially diffuse to identify the epileptogenic zone. Ripples are spatially focal, but represent both pathologic and physiologic processes. We address these limitations by focusing on the simultaneous occurrence of a spike and ripple, “spike-ripple” discharges, as an improved biomarker for the epileptogenic zone. Spike-ripples commonly occur in patients with epilepsy, improve the spatial specificity of spikes for the epileptogenic zone, and disentangle physiologic from pathologic ripples. Our interdisciplinary team will apply expertise in epilepsy, neurophysiology, neurosurgery, animal experiments, modeling, and statistics to: (i) develop a fully automated spike-ripple detector and compare its clinical utility to predict surgical outcome to spikes and ripples alone, (ii) identify the biological mechanisms that generate spike-ripple discharges using novel voltage imaging techniques in animal models combined with computational models; and (iii) develop principled neurostimulation protocols to disrupt the mechanisms that generate spike-ripples. Completion of these Aims will represent significant progress towards resolving fundamental questions in modern epilepsy research, an understanding of mechanisms in the core epileptogenic network that generate spike-ripples, and a principled approach to neurostimulation to focally disrupt these pathologic dynamics. Project Narrative Neurosurgical treatment of epilepsy often fails, and neurostimulation to treat epilepsy remains suboptimal and ad hoc. Identification of an improved biomarker - to target epilepsy treatment and assess treatment efficacy - is required. This project combines clinical data from human patients, experiments in animal models, and computer simulations of brain activity to develop an improved biomarker for epilepsy treatment, and to develop a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving the pathological brain dynamics in epilepsy.",Targeting pathologic spike-ripples to isolate and disrupt epileptic dynamics,10096727,R01NS119483,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consumption', 'Diffuse', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Generations', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recurrence', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'clinical practice', 'detector', 'effective therapy', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'human data', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'large datasets', 'models and simulation', 'mouse model', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'prevent', 'statistics', 'successful intervention', 'surgery outcome', 'voltage']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,698329
"Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture Abstract Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is one of the most common forms of pharmacologically resistant epilepsy. The resection or ablation of medial temporal structures can be curative for many patients. Unfortunately, approximately one third of patients who undergo TLE surgery continue to have disabling seizures post- procedurally. The reasons for suboptimal outcomes are not well understood and therefore constitute a very important knowledge gap in epilepsy care. A better understanding of this difference in surgical response phenotype could be used to improve surgical planning, treatment, outcome prediction and counseling. Promising preliminary studies suggest that TLE surgical outcomes can be inferred by neuroimaging computational tools assessing the cumulative degree of abnormalities in the topological organization of structural networks involving limbic and extra-limbic regions. Nonetheless, network abnormalities are not routinely or systematically used and quantified in the pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsies, and their assessment requires refinement and further validation. The purpose of this proposal is to perform a prospective study to test the hypothesis that the degree of limbic and extra-limbic network abnormalities in TLE, systematically assessed using a connectome approach based on optimized diffusion MRI (dMRI), can be used to predict and better understand epilepsy surgery outcomes. This hypothesis builds on the well-defined basic science and neurobiological premises that epilepsy is associated with pathological alterations in networks that are related to seizure onset and seizure propagation. Importantly, network abnormalities are not visible on routine MRI, but their detection using connectomes constitutes a modern approach to quantifying the location and magnitude of “lesional epilepsy,” where broad computational network abnormalities imply worse outcomes. We will prospectively gather clinical and imaging data at six epilepsy centers using the NIH epilepsy common data elements. This project will be fundamentally based on standard of care data, thus minimizing the burden of extra data collection and ensuring feasibility. Furthermore, this project will be embedded in the ENIGMA-Epilepsy framework, which is a collaborative platform for clinical and neuromaging multi-center research. Specific Aim 1 will define the accuracy, reproducibility, and predictive values of the pre-surgical dMRI tractography connectome model towards surgical results in TLE. We will perform hypothesis-driven tests of specific limbic and extra-limbic networks in relationship with clinical data and surgical outcomes. Specific Aim 2 will test if the neuroimaging-clinical outcome model can be further improved with advanced diffusion methods (multi-shell diffusional kurtosis imaging), resting state functional MRI networks, or a multimodal approach. We believe that this research will have an important impact on our understanding of the mechanisms related to TLE treatment. NARRATIVE While some patients can become seizure free with epilepsy surgery, others persist with disabling seizures and the reasons for vastly dissimilar outcomes are not well understood. Increasing evidence suggests that epilepsy-related neuronal network reorganization is at the core of the mechanisms underlying epilepsy severity and seizure control. This project will use individualized mapping of white matter neural networks to better understand the pathophysiology of epilepsy, identify reasons for treatment success, and guide strategies to improve surgical treatment.",Predicting Epilepsy Surgery Outcomes Using Neural Network Architecture,10158551,R01NS110347,"['Ablation', 'Anterior Temporal Lobectomy', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Common Data Element', 'Contralateral', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrocoagulation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fiber', 'Freedom', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Publishing', 'Refractory', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'millimeter', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel strategies', 'organizational structure', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'surgery outcome', 'tractography', 'white matter']",NINDS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2021,638854
"Virtual Resection to Treat Epilepsy More than 1/3 of the world’s 65 million people with epilepsy (~3.3 million in the U.S.) have seizures that cannot be controlled by medications. Surgery and implanted devices are options for many, but their success depends upon manually mapping epileptic networks, which is only possible for some patients, and poorly standardized. When surgical targets are identified, there is currently no rigorous way to select the best surgical approach. The overall aim of this proposal is to develop rigorous, standardized, quantitative methods to: (1) map epileptic networks from imaging and Stereo EEG (SEEG), (2) pick the best region for resection, ablation or neuromodulation for individual patients from their data and clinical hypotheses, and (3) to determine when focal intervention is unlikely to succeed. These methods would have tremendous positive impact on clinical care. Over the first four years of this grant we have made substantial progress towards these goals. Our deliverables include: (1) robust measures derived from intracranial EEG (IEEG) that predict outcome from epilepsy surgery; (2) personalized methods that localize epileptic networks and predict the impact of different interventions on seizure control; (3) tools that predict the path of seizure spread from combined MRI and iEEG; and (4) a track record of openly sharing our methods, data, results and code on our platform http: //ieeg.org. In the next phase, we propose innovative solutions to 3 fundamental challenges in epilepsy surgery required to translate our work into practice: (1) Guiding SEEG: We must adapt our methods to the sparser sampling and different philosophy of stereo EEG, which maps a network of connected brain regions and tests clinical hypotheses about where seizures initiate and propagate; (2) Assessing sampling bias and missing information: We will develop methods to determine if electrodes sample all key regions of the epileptic network, to ensure we do not falsely localize due to missing information; (3) Validating in a larger population across centers: In parallel to refining the above methods, we will validate and optimize our analyses in a large number of patients to ready this work for a prospective clinical trial. In a novel model, we have engaged a group of major surgical epilepsy centers to openly collaborate, standardize methods, aggregate data, and share all algorithms, computer code, data and results on http: //ieeg.org. Our central hypothesis is that standardized, quantitative methods to guide epilepsy surgery can improve patient outcomes, lower morbidity, reduce cost and enable uniform, higher quality care across centers. This work is significant because it merges state of the art network neuroscience, engineering, neurology and neurosurgery to make practical tools to improve and standardize patient care. This project leverages a thriving collaboration between experts in neurology, computational neuroscience, neurosurgery, neuroimaging and bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania that has generated 58 publications related to this proposal. We now extend this collaboration to academic epilepsy centers across the United States and worldwide. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because developing new quantitative methods to target and test epilepsy surgery in computer models before doing these procedures in the operating room will improve patient outcomes and reduce surgery side effects and costs. In this research we are also working with 15 major epilepsy centers to standardize treatment. For these reasons the proposal is relevant to part of the NIH’s mission to foster fundamental, creative discoveries and innovative research strategies that will ultimately protect and improve human health for the United States’ 3.3 million people with epilepsy.",Virtual Resection to Treat Epilepsy,10355919,R56NS099348,"['Ablation', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Archives', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Diffuse', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Excision', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Intervention', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Philosophy', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality of Care', 'Research', 'Resected', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Sampling Errors', 'Seizures', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer code', 'cost', 'data standards', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'side effect', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R56,2021,551628
"Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Despite the widespread adoption of new drug classes to treat epilepsy, approximately one third of patients do not respond to anti-epileptic medication. Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) suffer permanent memory and cognitive impairment from uncontrolled seizures. Only 8-10% of patients with DRE obtain long-term seizure freedom. About half of patients with DRE are eligible for surgical treatment, which results in seizure freedom in 58-73% of patients. However, it is difficult to determine when patients with DRE need surgery. DRE has a complex disease course that fluctuates according to weekly and monthly patterns. Further, neurologists report that they lack the resources (i.e. time) needed to analyze and interpret large amounts of electronic health record (EHR) data to determine surgical candidacy. This results in substantial delays in treatment - 6 years in pediatrics and 20 years in adults, on average - and contributes to avoidable morbidity and mortality. Automated systems are capable of assisting clinicians in identifying candidates for epilepsy surgery two years earlier in the disease course. One such system uses natural language processing to analyze free-text neurology notes in a real-time clinical setting. This system was able to increase the rate of surgical candidate identification by 46%, but it could still be improved in two important ways. First, the system is not able to incorporate results from EEG and MRIs - the most influential factors on surgical candidacy - into its recommendations. Second, it does not utilize rich information hidden in structured EHR data that captures epilepsy disease burden. A system that fuses information from all three data sources (neurology notes, EEG and MRI reports, and structured data) would drastically improve the accuracy and impact of the model. In the proposed research, I will first develop a deep learning (DL) approach for fusing multi-modal EHR data. Specifically, I will use recent advances in deep representation learning to produce richer features from both free- text and structured data. I will represent free-text in neurology notes and EEG and MRI reports with word embedding vectors, and medication, procedure, and visit codes with medical concept vectors. I will combine disparate data sources with a deep neural network to produce high-level representations of surgical candidacy. This will enable me to estimate patients' risk of future epilepsy surgery. Second, I will establish the generalizability of this approach using a neighboring hospital's EHR data and validate the system in a clinical setting. This contribution will be significant because it will increase the number of surgical candidates identified earlier in the disease course, thereby reducing epilepsy disease sequelae. This proposal will lay the groundwork for nationwide expansion of the DL system and generate the only automated DL system designed to improve the timeliness of surgical referral rates in the adult population. Project Narrative Automating the identification of patients with epilepsy who would benefit from surgical treatment is imperative to reducing morbidity and mortality from uncontrolled seizures. This research proposal will develop and clinically validate a generalizable deep learning framework for analyzing multi-modal electronic health record data to predict epilepsy surgery candidacy. Implementing this system into clinical care is expected to reduce the time to surgery by 45%, which would prevent one epilepsy-related death for every 58 patients who receive surgery.",Machine Learning Approach to Identify Candidates for Epilepsy Surgery,10224663,F31NS115447,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Memory impairment', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Schedule', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'candidate identification', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'electronic structure', 'improved', 'learning classifier', 'magnetic resonance imaging/electroencephalography', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'novel drug class', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'structured data', 'tool', 'vector']",NINDS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,F31,2021,40133
"SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy The research objective of this proposal, Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy Prediction, with Pl Dominique Duncan from the University of Southern California, is to predict the onset of epileptic seizures following traumatic brain injury (TBI), using innovative analytic tools from machine learning and applied mathematics to identify features of epileptiform activity, from a multimodal dataset collected from both an animal model and human patients. The proposed research will accelerate the discovery of salient and robust features of epileptogenesis following TBI from a rich dataset, collected from the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx), as it is being acquired by investigating state-of-the-art models, methods, and algorithms from contemporary machine learning theory. This secondary use of data to support automated discovery of reliable knowledge from aggregated records of animal model and human patient data will lead to innovative models to predict post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). This machine learning based investigation of a rich dataset complements ongoing data acquisition and classical biostatistics-based analyses ongoing in the study and can lead to rigorous outcomes for the development of antiepileptogenic therapies, which can prevent this disease. Identifying salient features in time series and images to help design a predictor of PTE using data from two species and multiple individuals with heterogeneous TBI conditions presents significant theoretical challenges that need to be tackled. In this project, it is proposed to adopt transfer learning and domain adaptation perspectives to accomplish these goals in multimodal biomedical datasets across two populations. Specifically, techniques emerging from d,eep learning literature will be exploited to augment data, share parameters across model components to reduce the number of parameters that need to be optimized, and use state-of-the-art architectures to develop models for feature extraction. These will be compared against established pipelines of hand-crafted feature extraction in rigorous cross-validation analyses. Developed techniques for transfer learning will be able to extract features that generalize across animal and human data. Moreover, these theoretical techniques with associated models and optimization methods will be applicable to other multi-species transfer learning challenges that may arise in the context of health and medicine. Multimodal feature extraction and discriminative model learning for disease onset prediction using novel classifiers also offer insights into biomarker discovery using advanced machine learning techniques through joint multimodal data analysis. A significant percentage of people develop epilepsy after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury. If we can identify who will develop post-traumatic epilepsy and at what time point after the injury, those patients can be treated with antiepileptogenic therapies and medications to stop or prevent the seizures from occurring. It is likely that biomarkers of epileptogenesis after TBI can only be found by analyzing multimodal data from a large population, which requires advanced mathematical tools and models.",SCH: INT: Collaborative Research: Multimodal Signal Analysis and Data Fusion for Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10093160,R01NS111744,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Chemicals', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hand', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Limbic System', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Psychological Techniques', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Rattus', 'Records', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Voting', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'animal data', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'data acquisition', 'data fusion', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'human data', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neural network classifier', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'post-trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'random forest', 'support vector machine', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,243545

Epilog EEG is analyzed for seizures and a daily digital seizure diary is shared with epileptologists (F) and pushed back to the Aura app (G). Epilog is recharged daily, and reusable for a year. Epilog is designed to be discreet, allowing for continuous use in all facets of daily life. Data are a 10 s snippet of the beginning of a focal seizure with motor impairment and intact awareness (ILAE 1A1) recorded from Epitel’s single-channel Epilog sensor placed on the left forehead. The patient was admitted for video-EEG monitoring as standard-of-care. This seizure was verified independently by three epileptologists. In Phase I, automated, machine learning-based seizure detection algorithms will be designed to first work in the Aura cloud to detect seizures in Epilog EEG, including seizures a person may not consciously know they are having (>50% of all seizures), such as while sleeping. Aura will run these algorithms developed exclusively for Epilog’s single-channel of EEG to provide a daily digital seizure diary. In Phase II, the Aura system will enter clinical validation trials for FDA clearance as an EEG-based automated home seizure detection and alerting system. Early in Phase II Aura will be commercialized as a medical device-enabled-service business model. Out-of-pocket costs for a person living with epilepsy is an average of $380/year. Armed with long-term, reproducible EEG, epileptologists will now have a more precise, quantitative record of seizure counts, enabling them to adapt patient treatment more rapidly and successfully to improve quality of life. Aura will give people living with epilepsy their lives back. Aura provides certainty where you are and when you need it. Throughout Phase II, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors will be combined in the Aura app to collect 27,000 days of multi-modal data from 300 patients to create an unprecedented dataset of features known to precipitate seizures. These data will be used in Phase III to create a robust, wearable seizure forecasting system using artificial intelligence that combines multi-modal seizure precipitating factors, creating an hourly seizure probability. Aura will profoundly disrupt how epilepsy is managed and improve the quality of life of people living with epilepsy. This grant proposal aims to create a digital health platform that includes a wearable medical device worn on the scalp below the hairline. The system detects and counts seizures, and alerts to seizures in real time. The goal is to empower people with epilepsy to take control of their seizure monitoring and help improve the treatment of epilepsy.",Automated Seizure Detection for Home Seizure Monitoring with Epilog Sensors,10200346,U44NS121562,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auras', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavioral', 'Bluetooth', 'Businesses', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Community Hospitals', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Family', 'Financial Hardship', 'Focal Seizure', 'Forehead', 'Freedom', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Left', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurologic', 'Paper', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposition', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Screening procedure', 'Secure', 'Seizures', 'Services', 'Sleep', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'System', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud platform', 'cost', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'digital health', 'effective therapy', 'encryption', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor impairment', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'remote monitoring', 'sensor', 'social', 'standard of care']",NINDS,"EPITEL, INC.",U44,2021,999853
"Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY Neurosurgical therapy of refractory epilepsy requires accurate localization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). In clinical practice, intracranial EEG (iEEG) is recorded in the epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over many days where multiple seizures are recorded to provide information to localize the SOZ. The prolonged monitoring in the EMU adds to the risk of complications and can include intracranial bleeding and potentially death. Recently, high frequency oscillations (HFO) of iEEG between 80 to 500 Hz are highly valued as a promising clinical biomarker for epilepsy. HFOs are believed to be clinically significant, and thus could be used for SOZ localization. However, HFOs can also be recorded from normal and non-epileptic cerebral structures. When defined only by rate or frequency, pathological HFOs are indistinguishable from physiological ones, which limit their application in epilepsy pre-surgical planning. In this proposal, to the best of our knowledge, we show of a recurrent waveform pattern that distinguishes pathological HFOs from physiological ones. In particular, we observed that the SOZ generates repeatedly a set of stereotyped HFO waveforms whereas the HFOs from nonepileptic regions were irregular in their waveform morphology. Based on these observations, using computational tools built on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques, we propose to detect these stereotyped recurrent HFO waveform patterns directly from the continuous iEEG data of adult and pediatric patients and test their prognostic value by correlating the spatial distribution of detected events to clinical findings such as SOZ, resection zone and seizure freedom. We hypothesize that accurate detection of pathologic HFOs in brief iEEG recordings can identify the SOZ and eliminate the necessity of prolonged EMU monitoring and reduce the associated risks. With these motivations, in this project an interdisciplinary team composed of biomedical engineers, epileptologists and neurosurgeons will work together to develop and test novel computational tools to detect stereotyped HFOs and its subtypes in large iEEG datasets recorded with clinical electrodes. Developed algorithms and iEEG data will be shared with the research community to contribute to the reproducible research and help other research groups to develop novel methods. The results of this study will be essential for achieving our group's long term goal of developing an online neural signal processing system for the rapid and accurate identification of SOZ with brief invasive recording. PROJECT NARRATIVE Prolonged iEEG monitoring for SOZ localization does add to the risk of complications and may include serious issues, such as intracranial bleeding, meningoencephalitis, and eventually death. The intellectual merit of this project is to develop computational intelligence tools based on recent advances in sparse coding and unsupervised machine learning techniques to investigate stereotyped high frequency oscillations (HFOs) in long-term iEEG and test the hypothesis whether the automated detection of HFOs will yield accurate and fast identification of SOZ.",Investigation of Stereotyped High-Frequency Oscillations with Computational Intelligence for the Prediction of Seizure Onset Zone in Epilepsy,10131881,R01NS112497,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Freedom', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Meningoencephalitis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Motor Cortex', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neocortex', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Seizures', 'Site', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Visual', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'computational intelligence', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R01,2021,459231
"CounterAct Administrative Supplement to NS114020 Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy Acute intoxication with organophosphorus (OP) pesticides is a significant public health concern and long-term neurological effects are not well understood. A major obstacle to progress towards reproducible, rigorous preclinical research in the long-term effects of OP- induced status epilepticus is that current experimental approaches often require prohibitively time and labor-intensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring and inherently subjective scoring of seizures by human observers (like the widely used Racine scale). While algorithms for automated seizure detection in EEG are improving, the critically important behavioral manifestations of acquired epilepsy and assessment of its cognitive comorbidities remain poorly quantified. Our parent grant focuses on developing an objective, high-throughput technique to characterize epileptic phenotypes using a new method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) and apply it to automated anti-epileptic drugs (AED) screening. The central idea of MoSeq rests on the discovery that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales that are arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”) that can be detected without observer bias by artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted 3D video analysis. In this administrative supplement project, we propose to employ and refine MoSeq to address key challenges in research into the development of new medical countermeasures (MCM) against nerve agents and OP pesticides. This includes testing if it is possible to objectively study the long-term effects of OP intoxication and evaluate MCMs at scale by determine epilepsy-specific behavioral modules and associated transition probabilities in mice after acute OP exposure. In addition, given that neuroinflammation is likely to play a key role in OP-induced persistent neuronal circuit disturbance, we will test if microglial depletion can rescue the OP-induced chronic changes in behavioral syllables and transition probabilities. Together, the aims in this administrative supplement will both benefit from and contribute to our parent grant’s goal to develop a reliable, sharable tool for the research community to study seizures and cognitive comorbidities of epilepsy. There is an urgent need for medical countermeasures (MCMs) against nerve agents and organophosphorus (OP) pesticides. The project will leverage from our recent technical breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to test if it is possible to objectively study the long-term effects of OP intoxication and evaluate MCMs at scale. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on preclinical research by enabling objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epileptic phenotypes in experimental animals after acute OP intoxication to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",CounterAct Administrative Supplement to NS114020 Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10227611,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cannabidiol', 'Chronic', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Intoxication', 'Isoflurophate', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Neurologic Effect', 'Observer Variation', 'Pesticides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Status Epilepticus', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'acquired epilepsy', 'automated algorithm', 'comorbidity', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical countermeasure', 'nerve agent', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuronal circuitry', 'novel therapeutics', 'parent grant', 'pre-clinical research', 'screening', 'tool', 'valproate']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,123798
"Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy There are 65 million people worldwide with epilepsy and 150,000 new cases of epilepsy are diagnosed in the US annually. However, treatment options for epilepsy remain inadequate, with many patients suffering from treatment-resistant seizures, cognitive comorbidities and the negative side effects of treatment. A major obstacle to progress towards the development of new therapies is the fact that preclinical epilepsy research typically requires labor-intensive and expensive 24/7 video-EEG monitoring of seizures that rests on the subjective scoring of seizure phenotypes by human observers (as exemplified by the widely used Racine scale of behavioral seizures). Recently, the Datta lab showed that complex animal behaviors are structured in stereotyped modules (“syllables”) at sub-second timescales and arranged according to specific rules (“grammar”). These syllables can be detected without observer bias using a method called motion sequencing (MoSeq) that employs video imaging with a 3D camera combined with artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted video analysis to characterize behavior. Through collaboration between the Soltesz and Datta labs, exciting data were obtained that demonstrated that MoSeq can be adapted for epilepsy research to perform objective, inexpensive and automated phenotyping of mice in a mouse model of chronic temporal lobe epilepsy. Here we propose to test and improve MoSeq further to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in epilepsy research. This includes the development of an objective alternative to the Racine scale, testing of MoSeq as an automated anti-epileptic drug (AED) screening method, and the development of human observer- independent behavioral biomarkers for seizures, epileptogenesis, and cognitive comorbidities. In addition, we plan to dramatically extend the epilepsy-related capabilities of MoSeq to include the automated tracking of finer-scale body parts (e.g., forelimb and facial clonus) that are not possible with the current approach. Finally, we propose to develop the analysis pipeline for MoSeq into a form that is intuitive, inexpensive, user-friendly and thus easily sharable with the research community. We anticipate that these results will have a potentially transformative effect on the field by demonstrating the feasibility and power of automated, objective, user- independent, inexpensive analysis of both acquired and genetic epilepsy phenotypes. There is an urgent need for new therapies for patients with uncontrolled epilepsy. The project will develop breakthrough technologies involving artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis of 3-dimensional video data of mouse behavior to address long-standing, fundamental challenges in preclinical epilepsy research. If successful, this innovative approach is expected to have a significant and sustained impact on epilepsy research by enabling investigators to perform objective, automated, inexpensive, reproducible assessment of epilepsy in experimental animals to aid the testing of anti-seizure drugs and other novel therapies.",Automated Phenotyping in Epilepsy,10178133,R01NS114020,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Body part', 'Cannabidiol', 'Carbamazepine', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clonazepam', 'Clonus', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Screening', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Face', 'Forelimb', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Observer Variation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phenytoin', 'Pilocarpine', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Seizures', 'Specificity', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'Tail', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Valproic Acid', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'comorbidity', 'drug use screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kainate', 'method development', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'selective expression', 'user-friendly']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,422740
"Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures Epileptic seizures are unpredictable events that significantly reduce quality of life. Predicting when the next seizure would occur could both prepare persons with epilepsy and their caregivers, and potentially aid in the treatment of seizures. Animal models of epilepsy provide an opportunity to explore the nature of brain activity in the period leading up to seizures. Using both mouse and rat models of generalized absence epilepsy, we have found a specific build up of thalamic neural spiking activity for several seconds before each seizure. This novel electrophysiological signature occurs in the absence of any overt epileptiform EEG activity. We propose to identify the neural circuits that are responsible for pre-seizure activity using high-density multi-channel silicon probes to record broadly across seizure-generating networks in the mouse. We will also measure calcium ion levels, a readout of neural activity, in neuronal cell bodies and their output axons using fluorescent calcium indicators (GCaMPs) and multiphoton microscopy to capture a highly complementary component of pre-seizure activity with high spatial resolution. Neural activity data will be collected together with EEG, locomotion signals, sensory-evoked responses, and pupil diameter to create a comprehensive multimodal stream of pre-seizure activity. This information will be fed into unbiased machine learning approaches to develop predictive algorithms. We will directly test coupling strength within thalamocortical pre-seizure networks by conducting network-level and targeted single-cell recordings in acute brain slices. To determine a specific role of pre- seizure networks in generating seizures, we will test whether chemogenetic or optogenetic silencing of key pre-seizure network elements reduces seizure incidence or severity. Finally, we will test whether we can use seizure-predictive signals to intervene in real-time and prevent seizures before they take hold. Together, these experiments will provide proof of concept for a novel therapeutic approach: targeting the pre-seizure state to improve seizure control. The unpredictable nature of seizures is a burden on persons with epilepsy and their caregivers. Using animal models of absence epilepsy, we propose to test new methods for a) predicting when the next seizure will occur and b) using this information to prevent seizures from occurring.",Tracking pre-seizure dynamics to predict and control seizures,10269920,R01NS117150,"['Absence Epilepsy', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Calcium ion', 'Caliber', 'Caregivers', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clozapine', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Dissection', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Activity', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Output', 'Oxides', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmacology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Pupil', 'Quality of life', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'SCN8A gene', 'Seizures', 'Sensory', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Slice', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Virus', 'awake', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'density', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo two-photon imaging', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,424577
