"Building a reinforcement learning tool for individually tailoring just-in-time adaptive interventions: Extending the reach of mHealth technology for improved weight loss outcomes Project Summary Excess weight is associated with 13 types of cancer. These cancers disproportionately affect Black and Latinx individuals, as well as those with lower socioeconomic status, because overweight and obesity incidence is higher in these groups. Behavioral weight loss interventions are effective, but in-person interventions tend to have low reach. As mobile phone ownership is increasing in the United States, mHealth technology holds promise for reaching a larger population than in-person behavioral interventions. Furthermore, because they travel with individuals and can collect digital information in real-time, mHealth tools make it possible to intervene with individuals at the precise point when the interventions are needed with just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs). As currently implemented, mHealth JITAIs are adaptive in the sense that interventionists can specify decision rules a priori that result in intervention messages that are triggered or tailored by certain events. These experimenter-specified decision rules are generally based upon results of prior studies, specifically micro-randomized trials that provide sequential tests of mHealth intervention messages in order to determine causal effects of messages conditional on user context. However, JITAIs that are developed in this manner cannot be truly individually tailored because the same decision rules are equally applied to everybody without regard to information about how individuals actually respond to intervention messages. Rapidly evolving machine learning methods, specifically reinforcement learning (RL), makes it possible to improve upon the current approach to JITAIs by learning each person's unique response patterns and integrating this information into subsequent, person-specific, adaptive decision rules. However, the few behavioral interventionists who have created mHealth JITAIs for weight loss using RL have noted high practical barriers to doing so because implementation of RL requires specialized expertise and can be labor intensive. The field needs a user-friendly tool to reduce these barriers in order for RL methodology to become widely adopted. Aim 1 is to develop Adapt, a tool that iteratively integrates real-time data, applies RL algorithms, and performs micro-randomized trials to optimize JITAI decision rules for weight loss. Adapt will pull in digital health data in real-time and conduct micro-randomized trials using behavioral patterns and outcomes to arrive at the most efficacious intervention message, delivered at the right time, for promoting weight loss in each participant. Aim 2 is to conduct a 12-week pilot feasibility study testing usability of Adapt in a weight loss intervention (NudgeRL). NudgeRL will build upon the team's existing JITAI, Nudge, which did not incorporate RL. The sample will consist of 20 adults with overweight or obesity, at least 50% of whom are Black or Latinx. Although Adapt will be developed to improve weight loss interventions, its widespread use will result in more efficient and efficacious JITAIs across a broad range of health outcomes, resulting in a lower burden of cancer and other disease due to a wide spectrum of improved health behaviors. Project Narrative The objective of this project is to develop a tool that will make it easier for behavioral interventionists to implement reinforcement learning, a type of machine learning, into adaptive mobile (mHealth) interventions, specifically those intended to promote weight control. Widespread use of this tool will result in more efficient and effective adaptive mHealth interventions, ultimately leading to a lower burden of obesity-linked disease, including cancer.",Building a reinforcement learning tool for individually tailoring just-in-time adaptive interventions: Extending the reach of mHealth technology for improved weight loss outcomes,10195835,R21CA260092,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cancer Burden', 'Cancer Control', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Obesity associated disease', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Positive Reinforcements', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Randomized', 'Rewards', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Update', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Work', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer type', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'digital', 'digital health', 'effective intervention', 'efficacious intervention', 'fitbit', 'follow-up', 'health data', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'low socioeconomic status', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'obesity risk', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'web-based tool', 'weight loss intervention']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,410893
"The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate for this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award aims to become an international leader in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel health care interventions and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis that is diagnosed in utero but that persists after birth, or postnatally persistent hydronephrosis (PNH). The proposed mentored research and career development plan lays the foundation for this career and the eventual development of a standardized management strategy for PNH by generating the evidence needed to support its development and creating an ultrasound (U/S) grading tool needed to implement it in routine clinical practice. Kidney U/Ss are the main test to monitor PNH, but U/S reports are heterogeneously formatted and contain synonymous and ambiguous terms that complicate their interpretation. Another major obstacle in the field is a need to predict those at risk for worsening disease and to better understand the natural history of PNH. Aim 1 will develop a Natural Language Processing algorithm to automatically translate free-text U/S reports into structured data providing the PNH grade. Aim 2 will use baseline U/S and renal scan data to predict the PNH grade at 2 years. Aim 3 will use growth curves to simulate PNH’s natural history and provide the time and frequency of disease resolution/improvement, stability, and progression. The candidate brings to this proposal experience as a pediatric urological surgeon at a large tertiary care children’s hospital and core research skills in epidemiology and biostatistics. An integral part of his career development will be a continued relationship with an outstanding multidisciplinary mentoring team with complementary strengths. The candidate’s primary mentor is Rachel Hess, MD, MS. Dr. Hess is a world renown expert in implementing interventions in routine clinical care and has an exemplary track record of mentorship. Flory Nkoy, MD, MS, MPH, the candidate’s co-mentor, is an expert in bioinformatics and internationally recognized for developing, disseminating, and implementing pioneering approaches to treat chronic disease in children. Advisors include Jeffrey Ferraro, PhD, and Wendy Chapman, PhD (bioinformatics), Angela Presson, PhD (biostatistics), Patrick Cartwright, MD (pediatric urology), and Mark Ebert, MD (pediatric radiology). The proposed research and training plan will establish the candidate’s solid foundation in bioinformatics, augment his prior epidemiology and biostatistics training, and provide extraordinary training in dissemination and implementation science. This will provide him with the skills and experience necessary for a career as a successful independent researcher focused on developing, implementing, and disseminating novel management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Hydronephrosis diagnosed in utero but persisting after birth (PNH) affects tens of thousands of infants each year in the United States, but its management is complicated by ambiguous reporting of hydronephrosis severity and a relatively limited understanding of predictors of disease outcome and knowledge of the disease’s natural history. The proposed research uses the largest known pediatric hydronephrosis cohort to develop a tool to translates free-text ultrasound reports into coded PNH grades, predict the 2-year outcome using 3-month baseline data, and apply sophisticated modeling techniques to simulate the disease’s natural history. Taken together, results from this proposal will lead to the development of a standardized management strategy for PNH and facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent research career in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel treatment and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, beginning with pediatric hydronephrosis.",The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH),10086087,K08DK119535,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Infant', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Radiology', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Pregnancy', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Selection Bias', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologic Surgeon', 'Urology', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'in utero diagnosis', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatrician', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prognostic', 'research and development', 'skills', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urinary', 'urologic']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2021,166997
"Biomechanical and Biological Predictors of Cartilage Health Following Meniscus Injury Abstract  Injury of the meniscus is frequently associated with early onset osteoarthritis (OA). Partial meniscectomy to remove the damaged meniscal tissue is the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedure. While this procedure can provide symptomatic relief in the short term, nearly 35% of patients develop radiographic evidence of OA within 5-7 years following surgery. However, the causes for this early onset OA are unknown. One potential pathway for the progression of knee OA following meniscectomy is through altered loading of the articular cartilage. However, other studies suggest that biological factors, such as joint inflammation may play an important role. Recently, through a combination of MR imaging, 3D modeling, and biplanar radiography, our team has shown that medial meniscal injury alters the cartilage-to-cartilage contact strains in both the medial and lateral compartments. In addition, we found that increased strain was correlated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in the synovial fluid, a biomarker which may be indicative of joint degradation. Together, these results suggest that biomechanical and biological factors play an important role in the development of OA after meniscal injury. However, the role of partial meniscectomy on these changes is unclear. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the biomechanical and biological environment of the joint before and after partial meniscectomy will elucidate the factors that contribute to early onset OA. Our overall hypothesis is that following partial meniscectomy, both biomechanical and biological changes in the joint will predict cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, when biomechanical and biological predictors are combined together with patient demographics and clinical characteristics, we will identify well-defined clinical phenotypes of patients at high risk of cartilage degeneration.  Cartilage degeneration will be assessed through MR-based measures of cartilage thickness and composition. Using high speed biplanar x-ray and MR imaging, in vivo cartilage strains in both knees of patients with unilateral medial meniscus injury will be measured in response to treadmill walking prior to surgery and after surgery. Synovial fluid and serum will also be collected and a panel of pro-inflammatory mediators and tissue metabolic biomarkers will be measured. Synovial fluid immune cell analyses will be performed by flow cytometry. Using these biomechanical and biological factors, we will identify participants at increased risk for cartilage degeneration at two years after surgery. Then, using predictive models combining biomechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics, we will develop well-defined clinical phenotypes of cartilage degeneration risk. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focused on surgery, pharmaceutical targets, and non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical rehabilitation strategies or weight loss, to prevent cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Meniscus injuries are very common and frequently lead to early onset osteoarthritis, a leading cause of disability. This project will identify biomechanical and biological predictors of cartilage degeneration after meniscus injury and partial meniscectomy. Our findings will be utilized to improve care and outcomes for patients suffering from meniscus injuries.",Biomechanical and Biological Predictors of Cartilage Health Following Meniscus Injury,10230722,R01AR079184,"['Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cadaver', 'Cartilage', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dinoprostone', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Medial meniscus structure', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Orthopedic Procedures', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Speed', 'Subgroup', 'Suggestion', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'articular cartilage', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'cartilage degradation', 'clinical phenotype', 'demographics', 'disability', 'early onset', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'joint destruction', 'joint inflammation', 'joint injury', 'macrophage', 'meniscus injury', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'random forest', 'rehabilitation strategy', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'treadmill']",NIAMS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,696513
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 “Center of Excellence”. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices.

"A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Allen Lee, MD is a gastroenterologist with advanced training in gastrointestinal motility whose research focuses on identifying abnormalities in host-microbial interactions to improve care in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals are to identify novel subgroups of IBS patients which inform biological responses to therapies and guide management. The proposed K23 mentored career development award includes a 3-year plan for training, didactics, and research activities that will provide Dr. Lee with the necessary skills and experience to become a successful independent investigator. Career Development: Dr. Lee will develop skills in the following four areas: 1) culture-independent approaches to study host-microbial interactions in IBS; 2) advanced biostatistical methods to study longitudinal datasets, including mixed models or generalized additive models; 3) laboratory-based translational techniques; 4) predictive analytics, such as machine learning algorithms. These training goals will directly contribute to Dr. Lee’s long-term career goals and prepare him to submit a successful R01 application. Research Context: Common treatments in diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D) are effective in ≤50% patients. Additionally, there are currently no methods to identify patients more likely to respond to different treatments. The current paradigm for managing IBS patients revolves around identifying and treating the predominant symptom complexes. However, this is a hugely inefficient model and leads to frustration for both patients and health care providers. This proposal seeks to determine whether a systems biology approach, which incorporates microbiome and metabolomics data along with detailed clinical phenotype information, may identify novel subgroups that inform treatment decisions in IBS-D. Research Plan: This career development award leverages an on-going clinical trial comparing the effects of a nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin with a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) in IBS-D patients to identify differences in microbial community structure and function in responders vs. non-responders to therapy. Specific Aim 1 will identify fecal microbial features by 16S rRNA sequence analysis characteristic of treatment response to rifaximin or a low FODMAP diet. Specific Aim 2 will determine how treatments with rifaximin or low FODMAP diet affect the fecal metabolome, including short chain fatty acids and bile acids, in IBS-D patients. Specific Aim 3 will develop predictive models to identify subsets of IBS-D patients responsive to treatment. We will also identify risk factors for non-response to either rifaximin or low FODMAP diet. Results from this proposal will inform two future R01 proposals to validate these findings as well as to understand the mechanisms by which host-microbial interactions may mediate response to different therapies in IBS. Project Narrative Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) is a common but difficult condition to manage likely because it is a heterogeneous disorder. This research proposal seeks to determine whether patients with IBS- D can be better stratified by their fecal microbiome and microbiome-derived metabolites. Results from this proposal may lead to a paradigm change in the way that we manage and treat IBS and potentially lead to an era of precision medicine in IBS.",A Systems Biology Approach Using Fecal Microbiota and Metabolomics to Identify Novel Subtypes in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.,10125589,K23DK124567,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Bile Acids', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Butyrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Culture-independent methods', 'Data', 'Diarrhea', 'Diet', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Foundations', 'Frustration', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monosaccharides', 'Multiomic Data', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Randomized', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Virulence Factors', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'common treatment', 'dietary', 'experience', 'fecal metabolome', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal microbiota', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient response', 'polyol', 'potential biomarker', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'resilience', 'response', 'rifaximin', 'skills', 'stem', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2021,194608

"A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases ABSTRACT  Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health epidemic and patients with CKD suffer from increased mortality and cardiovascular disease. Despite the severity of the disease, there are limited treatment options to hinder its progression. Tubular injury (TI) is a common finding on many kidney biopsies from patients with CKD, and there is mechanistic data supporting that TI can lead to interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. While interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are the strongest known pathologic predictor of progression of CKD, we have limited understand of how TI contributes to this progression. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) has been shown in animal studies to impact the severity of TI and is also known to trigger a fibrotic cascade, but there is limited data regarding its overall activity in kidney tissue, its cell type specific activity, its association with pathologic features or patient outcomes. It is of utmost importance to better understand this pathway as several Prolyl Hydroxylase inhibitors, which are novel therapeutic agents that increase the expression of HIF- 1α, are currently in clinical trial testing to treat anemia of CKD. The first aim of this proposal is to develop a measure of HIF-1α pathway activity that enables evaluation of clinical and morphologic features and cell-type specificity. Specifically, the candidate will a) Identify clinical and pathologic descriptors associated with increased HIF-1α pathway activity score and b) Determine the cell-type specific expression level of HIF-1α and its downstream components in tubular cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing. The second aim of this proposal is to determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity with outcomes and identify patients with increased HIF-1α activity non-invasively using biomarkers. Specifically, the candidate will a) Determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity score with patient outcomes and b) Identify serum or urine biomarkers that detect increased HIF-1α pathway activity in patients. The candidate will analyze data from 3 cohorts to accomplish these aims: Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), Clinical Phenotyping Resource and Biobank Core (C-PROBE) and the Native Americans with Type 2 Diabetes cohort (formerly known as the Pima Indian cohort). These investigations will allow us to monitor HIF-1α activity non-invasively in trials where patients receive novel drug agents, such as Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors.  The candidate will obtain formal training in analysis of gene expression data, single cell RNA- sequencing and machine learning techniques during the course of the award period to successfully integrate gene expression data, pathology data and clinical data. She will be mentored by an expert team with complementary experience in nephrology, tubular injury biology, systems biology and bioinformatics. The long-term goal of these investigations is to ultimately be able to better sub-type patients with tubular injury based on mechanistic terms. NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease is a global health epidemic and is associated with increased mortality, but we do not have a detailed understanding of why this disease progresses. Identifying sub-types of patients who progress by the same molecular mechanism is important to identify patients for future clinical trials. This project aims to use gene expression data from kidney biopsies to identify patients who will respond differently to medications that increase the expression of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 alpha.",A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases,10126847,K08DK124449,"['Address', 'Anemia', 'Animals', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemic', 'Erythropoietin', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Hypoxia', 'Hypoxia Inducible Factor', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Native Americans', 'Nephrology', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pima Indian', 'Process', 'Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'experience', 'global health', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'phase III trial', 'predictive marker', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2021,168955
"Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury Project Summary Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as the leading cause of death and disability in all parts of the world and costs the international economy approximately US$400 billion annually, which, given an estimated standardized gross world product of US $73.7 trillion, is a striking 0.5% of the entire annual global output. To address the profound issues related to a drastic increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations for TBI over the past decades, the United States Congress highlighted injury surveillance as a federal priority. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines surveillance as “use of health-related data that precede diagnosis and signal a sufficient probability of a case or an outbreak to warrant further public health response”. To prevent TBI, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns, in addition to having strong knowledge of clinical disorders, characteristic, or other definable entity, that differentiates TBI from other clinical populations. A critical barrier to the progress of the NIH-funded program “Comorbidity in traumatic brain injury and risk of all-cause mortality, functional and financial burden: a decade-long population based cohort study” was the presence of complex and multifaceted comorbidities in a patient with TBI before and at the time of the injury, and their links to patients’ frailty, injury circumstances, severity, and outcomes. This resulted in a shift in the research paradigm, and development of a novel data mining approach used in genomics to sequence more than 70,000 clinical diagnosis codes in a TBI population, and compare them to a matched population. The developed data mining approach allowed not only the validation of previously known risk factors of TBI, but also the identification of associations previously unknown, without any preconceived human biases. This project will continue advancement of a non-hypothesis driven scientific approach, which will: (1) Characterize patients with TBI at three different time periods in relation to the TBI event – before, at the time of, and after the injury; (2) Develop individual and population level models to study the transitions between the different time states; and (3) Construct and validate predictive models of susceptibility to TBI events, adverse outcomes, and high healthcare resource use at the individual and population level. Decades- long population-based health administrative data from the publicly-funded healthcare system in Ontario, Canada is ready to be further analysed for clinical and technological advancement, to support human thinking in categorizing personal, clinical, and environmental exposure data preceding TBI. Project Narrative To detect, manage, and prevent traumatic brain injury (TBI), a complex and often lifelong disabling injury, it is essential to understand its distribution and patterns and have a comprehensive knowledge of the clinical disorder, characteristic, or other definable entity that differentiates between and within persons at risk of TBI of varying mechanisms, injury presentation, and its course. This research proposal expands an ongoing NIH-funded project that started to categorize clinical comorbidities and personal and environmental exposure data into clinically meaningful factors that increase the risk of injury and its severity at the population and individual levels. With the support of data mining and big data, this proposed program will advance research methods with a goal-directed learning process and the fields of injury surveillance and precision medicine, covering a variety of interests in public health, brain injury medicine, and behavioural and social sciences.",Machine learning to inform health services and policy for traumatic brain injury,10223453,R01NS117921,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Ambulances', 'Americas', 'Amnesia', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Pathology', 'Canada', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Elements', 'Emergency department visit', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Injury', 'International', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural regeneration', 'Ontario', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Province', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Secondary to', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TBI Patients', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Unconscious State', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'assault', 'behavioral/social science', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data mining', 'disability', 'expectation', 'falls', 'frailty', 'functional outcomes', 'gender disparity', 'improved', 'informatics tool', 'injury recovery', 'injury surveillance', 'interest', 'medically necessary care', 'men', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'sex', 'social', 'survivorship', 'vehicular accident', 'virtual']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO,R01,2021,188548
"Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches Project Summary  Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, affecting every 200-1000 people, depending on the population and diagnostic criteria. FH leads to lifetime raised low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a high risk for premature atherosclerosis and downstream coronary heart disease. FH is designated as Tier 1 disease by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, notably one of only three such diseases, because it is common, is associated with a high risk of premature illness, and is treatable with lifestyle or medications. Great uncertainty exists about the optimal approach to FH screening, which is reflected in conflicting recommendations in national screening guidelines.  We propose to synthesize high quality data from national surveys and population-based cohort studies in a health policy computer simulation model comparing the health and economic value of different FH screening strategies. This study will prioritize the optimal approaches to FH screening in the U.S. population, identifying optimal initial screening age and defining the role of genetic testing in screening.  We have assembled a team of experts in pediatric preventive cardiology, decision analysis, cardiovascular disease epidemiology, population genetics, biostatistics, health economic evaluation, and computer simulation modeling in order to evaluate and compare different FH screening strategies in children and adults. We aim to use this expertise and these methods in order to:   Quantify diagnostic yield, clinical effectiveness, and economic value of universal FH phenotype  screening in childhood or adulthood, and the added value of FH genotype screening   Compare universal FH screening to the alternatives of using family history or a Big Data-based  algorithm to direct targeted screening limited to children and adults with possible FH diagnosis   Quantify the health and economic value of cascade screening families of FH cases  We hypothesize that FH screening in childhood will be the highest value screening strategy in the U.S. population, and that genetic testing will improve diagnosis and treatment decisions most in cases of diagnostic uncertainty (e.g., borderline high cholesterol or absent family history). We hypothesize that a machine-learning algorithm will avoid the costs and complexity of universal screening, while yielding a similar case yield, as long as cholesterol testing is sufficiently common in children.  This study will identify the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population and the most influential data based on current knowledge and set the stage for efficiently designed clinical trials of FH screening. This study will be a test case for the concept of a “precision” population health approach to screening for genetically-determined diseases in the general population. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder characterized by lifetime elevated cholesterol, which, if uncontrolled, is associated with premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Conflicting current national guidelines highlight that the optimal approach to FH screening in the U.S. population is controversial: it is unclear if screening should start in childhood or adulthood, or if it should include genetic testing. We propose to synthesize data from national surveys, high quality cohort studies, and clinical trials of cholesterol lowering interventions in a lifetime cardiovascular disease risk computer simulation model to project the life time health impact of different FH screening approaches and identify optimal screening strategies in children and adults.","Familial hypercholesterolemia screening in children: population impact of phenotype, genotype, and cascade approaches",10152666,R01HL141823,"['Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coronary heart disease', 'County', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Familial Hypercholesterolemia', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Family member', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genotype', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Policy', 'Hepatocyte', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Low Prevalence', 'Low-Density Lipoproteins', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive', 'Preventive service', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proxy', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'economic evaluation', 'economic value', 'genetic testing', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifestyle intervention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'models and simulation', 'pediatric patients', 'population based', 'population health', 'premature', 'premature atherosclerosis', 'prevent', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'screening program', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,788885
"A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients Summary – Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began, the emergence of an associated novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been reported. Interestingly, patients with MIS-C follow a presentation, management and clinical course that are somewhat similar to that of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD). Currently, the reason for such an overlap in clinical features and management is unclear and whether this overlap is the result of a partially shared etiology or pathophysiology is the subject of fierce debates. The degree of overlap implies that some of the clinical prediction tools that we have developed in the past for KD could be repurposed to accelerate the development of clinical support decision tools for MIS-C. In this study, we will first (R61 component) systematically address the overlap between KD and MIS-C and create salient machine-learning based prediction models for diagnosis/identification (Aim #1), management (Aim #2), and short- and long-term outcomes (Aim #3) of MIS-C based on our previously developed predictive models for KD in a process akin to transfer learning. Secondly (R33 component), we will validate and evaluate the performance and clinical utility of these models in a predictive clinical decision support system for the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients presenting with features indicative of either MIS-C or KD. In this study we will include 3 groups of patients: 1) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with MIS-C (CDC criteria) regardless of whether they have overlapping signs of KD, 2) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection investigated for but eventually not diagnosed with MIS-C, and 3) patients with KD but without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted data will be collected from enrolled patients (900 for training and 450 for validation) for deep phenotyping and biomarker measurements. Physician feedback on the predictions generated by the algorithm will be used to establish clinical utility. Data required for model training will be accrued in the first two years of activity (R61 period of the grant); the development of algorithms and their internal validation will occur concurrently. In the following 2 years (R33 period of the grant), we will perform external validation, establish clinical utility, add real- time epidemiological surveillance data to the models and finally package, and certify the algorithms for future deployment and for the integration in electronic health records. This project will be a collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) Consortium. The IKDR Consortium has an active KD and pediatric COVID registry in 35 sites across the world and the number of sites is currently expanding to 60+ sites. More than 600 MIS-C patients have already been identified at IKDR centers, making this project clearly feasible and perfectly positioning IKDR to perform this study. We strongly believe that the use of emerging data science methods and of our previously developed algorithms in the context of KD, as opposed to focusing on MIS-C patients alone, will boost our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of both MIS-C and KD and will more rapidly lead to the emergence of data-driven management protocols for patients with MIS-C. Project narrative - The primary objective of this study is to design and validate a predictive decision support system for the identification, treatment and management of SARS-CoV-2 associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). To develop this system, we will adapt and retrain machine learning algorithms which we have previously trained in patients with Kawasaki Disease, a pediatric inflammatory vasculopathy with multiple similarities to MIS-C. This study, performed in collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) consortium, will consist of two phases, first a large-scale data collection and algorithm development effort and second, the prospective evaluation of the performance and clinical utility of the algorithm ahead of large-scale deployment.",A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients,10272448,R61HD105591,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Decision Support Systems', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical predictors', 'coronavirus disease', 'design', 'disease registry', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'interoperability', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pediatric patients', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R61,2021,917957
"Data-Driven Identification of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This K01 proposal will complete Michael Sjoding, MD, MSc's training towards his long-term career goal of improving care of patients with acute respiratory disease. Dr. Sjoding is a Pulmonary and Critical Physician at the University of Michigan with master's level training in clinical study design and biostatistics. This proposal builds on Dr. Sjoding's prior expertise, providing protected time for additional training in data science, the technical methods for deriving new knowledge about human disease from “Big Biomedical Data” in the rich training environment at the University of Michigan. The project's research goal is to develop real-time systems to improve accuracy and timeliness of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) diagnosis using electronic health record data. ARDS is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year with high mortality. Under-recognition of this syndrome is the key barrier to providing evidence-based care to patients with ARDS. The research will be completed under the guidance of primary mentor Theodore J. Iwashyna, MD, PhD and co-mentors Timothy P. Hofer, MD, MSc, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD, and a scientific advisory board with additional expertise in data science and applied clinical informatics. The 5-year plan includes didactic coursework, mentored research, and professional development activities, with defined milestones to ensure successful transition to independence. The mentored research has 2 specific Aims: Aim 1. Develop a novel system for identifying ARDS digital signatures in electronic health data to accurately identify patients meeting ARDS criteria. Aim 2. Define the early natural history of developing ARDS, to more accurately predict patients' future ARDS risk. Both Aims will utilize rigorous 2-part designs, with the ARDS diagnostic and prediction models developed in the same retrospective cohort and validated in temporally distinct cohorts. In completing these high-level aims, the research will leverage high-resolution electronic health record and beside-monitoring device data to study ARDS with unprecedented detail, providing new insights into ARDS epidemiology and early natural history. This work will build to at least two R01 proposals: (1) testing the impact of a real-time electronic health record- based ARDS diagnostic system to improve evidence-based care practice, (2) defining ARDS subtypes using deep clinical phenotypic data. The work will build toward a programmatic line of research using high-resolution electronic health data to improve understanding of critical illness and respiratory disease. In completing this proposal, Dr. Sjoding will acquire unique computational expertise in data science methods, complementing his previous training, which he can then readily apply to address other research challenges in respiratory health. The ambitious but feasible training and mentored research proposed during this K01 award will allow him to achieve his goal of becoming an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a critical illness syndrome affecting 200,000 people each year in intensive care units with a 30% mortality rate. To improve ARDS care, new approaches are urgently needed to improve ARDS identification—the critical first step to ensuring patients receive life-saving treatments.

"Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors Project Summary / Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung injury usually requiring mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). While the number of ICU patients requiring mechanical ventilation is steadily increasing, in-hospital mortality is declining, creating a growing population of ARDS survivors. Such survivorship comes at a high “cost,” with ARDS patients frequently experiencing new or worsening physical, cognitive, and/or mental health impairments that last for years after ARDS. NHLBI and professional societies identify improving quality of life for ARDS survivors as a key research priority. Some ARDS survivors may adapt to new impairments over time and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. This adaptation phenomenon is known as “response shift.” We hypothesize that ARDS survivors demonstrate widely varying degrees of response shift, and that patients' baseline characteristics prior to ARDS have important associations with the magnitude of response shift after ICU discharge. We also investigate how psychosocial factors, including trait anxiety, social support, resilience, and survivor expectations for functional recovery, impact quality of life during recovery as a first step toward designing and evaluating new interventions for ARDS survivors.  This proposal will exploit a unique, pre-existing cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors from the NHLBI ARDS Network Long Term Outcome Study (ALTOS) containing hundreds of data elements per patient. Using modern data science methods, I will empirically evaluate the association between baseline patient characteristics and response shift between 6 and 12 months after ARDS [Aim 1], and identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health, from among ~165 candidate measures, that best predict changes in quality of life [Aim 2]. To investigate how psychosocial factors impact quality of life, I will conduct a new, prospective, ICU cohort study of ARDS survivors to collect data for these novel analyses [Aim 3]. The results from these three Aims will generate new knowledge regarding empirically-derived, testable hypotheses about important determinants of quality of life, and provide essential data for designing future studies of interventions aimed at improving the quality of life of ARDS survivors.  This career development award provides training in data science, patient outcomes-oriented clinical research, and machine learning statistical techniques for the applicant who is a PhD-trained epidemiologist without these skills. Immediate, short-term, and long-term career goals include: (1) publishing results of the proposed research, (2) successfully competing for R-level funding to explore whether addressing psychosocial issues, including setting appropriate patient expectations for recovery, is a potentially modifiable, low-cost intervention to improve ARDS survivor's quality of life, and (3) becoming an NHLBI-funded independent research scientist who conducts innovative and methodologically rigorous data science research on ARDS outcomes. Project Narrative A large and growing number of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) survivors frequently experience new and long-lasting physical, cognitive, and mental health impairments. ARDS survivors may exhibit a phenomenon known as “response shift” in which survivors adapt to new impairments and report improving quality of life not explained by improvements in objective measures of their physical, cognitive, and mental health. Using a cohort of very well-characterized ARDS survivors, this project will evaluate the association between individual-level response shift and patient characteristics, identify the changes in specific aspects of physical, cognitive, and mental health that best predict changes in quality of life between 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge, and evaluate the association between psychosocial factors including patient expectations for functional recovery and quality of life during recovery from ARDS.",Understanding Response Shift in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) survivors,10131844,K01HL141637,"['Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiological trend', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perceived quality of life', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Professional Organizations', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Psychosocial Influences', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'analytical tool', 'career', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'health data', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intervention cost', 'lung injury', 'novel', 'patient expectation', 'patient subsets', 'prospective', 'resilience', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'survivorship', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'working group']",NHLBI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,174917
"Antibody isotyping for discrimination of disease stage and diagnosis of early Lyme disease. ABSTRACT More than 3 million tests are performed each year to support the laboratory diagnosis of human Lyme disease (LD). While the CDC conventional standard two-tier (CSTT) approach for serodiagnosis of LD has worked relatively well when used as recommended, there is plenty of room for improvement. Of a number of weaknesses associated with the supplemental immunoblot of the CSTT the most significant is low reproducibility due to the subjective visual interpretation of results. To overcome these weaknesses the CDC recently updated its recommendations based on a modified STT (MSTT) in that a second EIA can replace the immunoblot. The major goal of this project is to develop an objective, quantitative, multiplex EIA that can detect four antibody isotypes (IgM/D/G/A) and all four IgG subclasses (IgG1/2/3/4) to leverage acquisition of simultaneous antibody profile information on multiple B. burgdorferi antigens to build an assay that can discriminate Lyme disease stage with increased overall sensitivity without incurring in loss of specificity. The novelty of this study relies on: 1) evaluation of B. burgdorferi antigen-specific antibody isotypes and IgG subclasses that can be correlated with Lyme disease stage; and 2) development of new diagnostic tools using machine learning techniques to train and integrate all data and produce an objective result to discriminate early Lyme from early disseminated/late Lyme disease. We expect this Phase I SBIR to allow us to develop a new EIA for serodiagnosis of Lyme disease (isoEIAplex-Ld) and to further an ongoing collaboration with DCN diagnostics for the adaptation of our biomarkers to a new rapid Lateral Flow Assay (see Letter of Support) for a follow up Phase II SBIR .

"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment.",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,10310774,UH3NS103550,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'antidepressant effect', 'base', 'clinical implementation', 'connectome', 'control trial', 'evidence base', 'live stream', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'response', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'white matter']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,UH3,2021,109980
"Muscle Control Mechanism of Voice Production in Vocal Fold Paralysis Project Summary After nearly five decades of human voice research, much remains unknown regarding muscle control mechanism of voice production. Studies confirmed that vocal fold pre-phonatory posture (geometry, position, tension and stiffness) is among the primary factors controlling vocal fold vibratory dynamics and voice type. However, very limited data is available on muscle control of these properties, primarily due to experimental difficulties. Muscle control of glottic geometry and dynamics has been studied in in vivo human and animal models, but these studies were limited to an endoscopic superior view, thus cannot to provide 3D deformation/movement of the vocal folds. Moreover, tension and stiffness of the vocal fold tissues are very difficult to obtain in vivo due to a lack of reliable techniques. A significant knowledge gap remains regarding how intrinsic laryngeal muscles (ILMs) control voice production through vocal fold posturing as well as how ILM dysfunctions, such as vocal fold paralysis/paresis (VFP), affect voice production by altering vocal fold posturing. In this project, we propose to use an innovative approach that integrates experimental data and state-of-the-art computer modeling techniques to produce a complete dataset of 3D vocal fold postures (geometry, position, tension, stiffness), 3D vocal fold vibratory dynamics, and voice outcomes in the full muscle control space including symmetric, asymmetric and compensative muscle activations. The PI’s group recently developed a state-of-the-art, physics based, 3D computer model that integrates realistic laryngeal anatomy, physiologically quantifiable inputs, inverse material parameterization and machine learning for simulating vocal fold posturing and flow-structure-acoustics interaction (FSAI) during voice production. For this project, we propose to combine this embodied model with experimental data to generate a holistic view of vocal fold posturing and FSAI with great temporal and spatial details in the full muscle control space. In particular, the model will reveal the 3D complexity of vocal fold postures and vibrations and provide measures of tension and stiffness with muscle activations, which have not been available. We propose to use the dataset to elucidate causal links among muscle activity, vocal fold posturing, vocal fold vibration and voice outcome. Muscle combinations with distinct posturing, vibration and acoustic patterns will be identified. The new knowledge is expected to elucidate the muscle control mechanism of voice production through vocal fold posturing. The proposed work has the potential to improve insight into the function and dysfunction of the ILMs and to serve as a foundation for novel, targeted therapeutic approaches. We hope to develop possible biomechanical metrics for the diagnosis and optimal methodology for treatment of VFP. Project Narrative Vocal fold paralysis/paresis (VFP) is the most common etiology of voice disorders which affects 9% of the U.S. population. Diagnosis and optimal treatment of VFP remain challenging because of incomplete understanding of muscle control mechanism of vocal fold posturing and vibration. This project will build causal links among muscle activation, vocal fold posturing, vocal fold vibration and voice acoustics, allowing for the development of possible biomechanical metrics for diagnosis and optimal treatment of VFP.",Muscle Control Mechanism of Voice Production in Vocal Fold Paralysis,10299679,R15DC019229,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Biomechanics', 'Canis familiaris', 'Computer Models', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Etiology', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Laryngeal muscle structure', 'Larynx', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Otolaryngology', 'Outcome', 'Paralysed', 'Paresis', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Production', 'Property', 'Research', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Voice', 'Voice Disorders', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'professor', 'simulation', 'targeted treatment', 'vibration', 'vocal cord']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MAINE ORONO,R15,2021,431951
"Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor Each year in the US, there are thousands of children who are born with a severe congenital deformation, where one of the two ventricles in the heart is severely underdeveloped. If they survive infancy, these children can go on to live full and normal lives. The mortality rate for this condition is 15%, and 63% of these deaths are due to cardio-respiratory arrests. This alarming rate of arrest events persists despite vigilant ICU care with the best available intensive monitoring equipment. Our overall goal is to improve current patient monitoring systems by developing machine learning algorithms that can predict the onset of an arrest event, hours before it occurs. This early warning indication can be provided to nurses and doctors who can intervene to prevent these life-threatening events from occurring, improving outcomes for these critically ill children. Preliminary studies at Texas Children's Hospital have resulted in a computer algorithm that can estimate the odds of arrest in single ventricle children, 1-2 hours prior to overt symptoms. The algorithm is based on a logistic regression risk model, and was developed using over 55,000 hours of vital sign observations. The specific aims of the proposed research are: (1) To test the hypothesis that this computer algorithm can provide an early warning of arrest, with sufficient accuracy for clinical use across different clinical centers; (2) To understand the relationship between the risk score provided by this algorithm and other post- surgical complications that commonly occur in these children during the their hospitalization. Aim 1 is a multi-center study of this algorithm on a large, prospective, and independent cohort, in order to measure its true predictive performance. Performance metrics to be measured will be the ROC area and positive and negative likelihood ratios. This will help us determine the optimal threshold for the detection of an arrest event. Aims 2 focus on relating the risk of arrest to outcomes such as mechanical circulatory support, re-operation, arrhythmia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Successful completion of these aims will result in the first clinically validated, real- time early warning system for anticipating acute arrest events in children with single ventricle physiology. The techniques and technologies developed in this work are immediately translatable to other diseases and conditions for both adults and children. Thousands of children each year are born in the US with only a single functional ventricle, putting them at substantial risk of acute cardiac arrest and ultimately death. This project will validate a new monitoring technology, developed at Texas Children's Hospital, which can predict the onset of arrest 1-2 hours before it occurs in this population. This technology will provide nurses and doctors the valuable time that they need to mitigate problems leading up to arrest before these problems become life threatening, improving the chance of survival for these critically ill children.",Multi-Site Validation Study of the HLHS Arrest Predictor,10171413,R01HL142994,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Behavior', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Common Ventricle', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Ventricle', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infant', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Nurses', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Surgery', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Surgical complication', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical center', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'news', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'repaired', 'respiratory', 'validation studies']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,575613
"Molecular and metabolic signaling in necrotizing enterocolitis The goal of the current R35 proposal is to understand the underlying pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants, and to develop novel treatments for this devastating disease. The typical patient with NEC is a premature infant who rapidly progresses from mild feeding intolerance to systemic sepsis and then death within 24 hours. NEC disproportionately affects communities of color, and half of all patients will require laparotomy, which reveals patchy intestinal inflammation and necrosis. There is no specific treatment for NEC, which increases the urgency to develop novel therapies for this devastating disease.  The journey which has led me to write this proposal includes over two decades of research into NEC, including the advancement of a unifying theorem to explain NEC development, the discovery of several classes of anti-NEC agents which have been patented, and most recently, the completion as sole Editor-in- Chief of the first textbook devoted to NEC. This track record gives me a unique vantage point in which to identify the most important unanswered questions in the field, and the experience to create a plan to answer them. Prevailing thinking suggests that NEC arises from an exuberant inflammatory response to bacterial colonization in the premature intestine. In mice and human studies, I discovered that the receptor for gram negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide, namely toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), on the intestinal epithelium, is required for NEC development. TLR4 activity is higher in the premature human and mouse intestinal lining compared to the full-term intestine, which reflects TLR4's role in governing gut development. The subsequent activation of TLR4 by colonizing bacteria leads to inflammation and NEC. These observations formed the basis for my discovery of a novel class of anti-TLR4 molecules that prevent and treat NEC in mice, piglet and human tissue ex vivo. In the current proposal, we will now address four critical knowledge gaps in the field of NEC research: 1. What causes NEC and its hallmark patchy intestinal necrosis? To answer this, we will employ ssRNA-seq in mouse and human NEC tissue and human organoids to discover and then modify TLR4- dependent genetic pathways causing NEC; 2. How can we prevent NEC? We will assess the role of diet (breast milk vs. formula) and immunometabolism on the induction of inflammation in the preterm gut and then manipulate diet-induced inflammatory pathways to reduce NEC; 3. Can we predict NEC earlier? We will assess cellular and molecular maternal factors that contribute to NEC, image blood flow in the premature gut non-invasively, and develop machine learning algorithms for prediction; 4. What causes the long term complications of NEC on the lung, brain and gut? We will perform discovery arrays in humanized organoid platforms as well as mouse and piglet NEC models to identify the link between the inflamed gut and end organ injury. These studies promise to significantly advance the field of NEC, and to offer specific therapies for it. Project Narrative Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the leading cause of death from gastrointestinal disease in premature infants, and for which there exists no effective cure. The current proposal has identified four major questions in the field of NEC which we now seek to answer, through a novel focus on identifying what causes NEC, how we can prevent NEC, how we can predict NEC, and how we can reduce the impact of NEC on causing long term complications on the brain, the gut and the lung.",Molecular and metabolic signaling in necrotizing enterocolitis,10206378,R35GM141956,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bacteria', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Milk', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intestines', 'Knowledge', 'Laparotomy', 'Legal patent', 'Link', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Lung', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Necrosis', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Organoids', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Premature Infant', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'TLR4 gene', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Writing', 'experience', 'feeding', 'human tissue', 'inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'intestinal epithelium', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'organ injury', 'prediction algorithm', 'premature', 'prevent', 'receptor']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,409375
"The role of the lung microbiome in oxygen-induced lung injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Background and long-term objectives: This proposed research will advance our understanding of how the lung microbiome contributes to the pathogenesis and perpetuation of oxygen-induced lung injury. Inhaled oxygen is among our most commonly administered therapies. Yet hyperoxia - elevated inspired oxygen - causes lethal lung injury in animals, and in humans is associated with increased mortality and development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome. We have recently discovered that hyperoxia acutely alters lung microbiota. This oxygen-induced dysbiosis is strongly and temporally correlated with alveolar inflammation. We have discovered that germ-free mice - experimental mice devoid of microbiota - are protected from oxygen- induced lung injury, an observation that cannot be explained via our conventional model of oxygen-induced lung injury. Conversely, lung injury alters lung microbiota by changing bacterial growth conditions within the lung microenvironment. We have discovered that germ-free mice are protected from non-resolving lung injury (bleomycin), indicating that the microbiome is necessary for perpetuation of lung injury. The discovery of the lung microbiome has thus broadened our model of pathogenesis. The mechanisms by which lung microbiota mediate oxygen-induced lung injury, and are in turn altered by lung injury, are undetermined. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that specific bacteria within the lung ecosystem propel alveolar inflammation in oxygen-induced lung injury, and these bacteria are enriched within the lung microbiome both by hyperoxia itself and by the altered ecology of injured lungs. The rationale is that these discoveries will facilitate the development of therapies for the prevention and treatment of oxygen-related human lung disease. Specific Aim 1: To determine the microbial and molecular pathways by which oxygen therapy alters lung microbiota, mediating host inflammation and injury. We will accomplish this Aim by integrating complementary experimental approaches: in vivo heterogeneity analysis of host-microbiome interactions in mice; in vivo germ-free, gnotobiotic, and antibiotic-treated hyperoxia modeling in mice; data science interrogation of observational human data using a validated machine-learning algorithm. Specific Aim 2: To determine the molecular pathways by which oxygen-induced host inflammation and injury alter lung microbiota, perpetuating respiratory dysbiosis and lung injury. We will accomplish this Aim by integrating complementary experimental approaches: a novel ex vivo culture assay that identifies host- derived mediators of bacterial growth; in vivo augmentation and inhibition of the host response in hyperoxia. This translational research approach will determine 1) the key members of the lung microbiome that mediate oxygen-induced lung injury, 2) the pathways by which these bacteria promote alveolar inflammation, and 3) the ecologic factors within the injured lung environment that promote their growth. PROJECT NARRATIVE Inhaled oxygen is among our most commonly administered therapies, yet hyperoxia - elevated inspired oxygen - causes lethal lung injury in animals, and in humans is associated with increased mortality and severe lung disease. We have recently discovered that the lung microbiome - the communities of microbes living in the respiratory tract - are altered by inhaled oxygen and necessary for the development of oxygen-induced lung injury. This proposed research plan will reveal how the lung microbiome contributes to oxygen-induced lung injury, and provide us with new ways to prevent and treat this common clinical problem.",The role of the lung microbiome in oxygen-induced lung injury,10202718,R01HL144599,"['Acute', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Assay', 'Bleomycin', 'Clinical', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Ecosystem', 'Environment', 'Experimental Models', 'Feedback', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hyperoxia', 'Immune response', 'Inflammation', 'Inhalation', 'Injury', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Oxygen', 'Oxygen Therapy Care', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prevention', 'Prevention therapy', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Respiratory System', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Sterility', 'Translational Research', 'dysbiosis', 'host microbiome', 'host microbiota', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'lung injury', 'lung microbiome', 'lung microbiota', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,430284
"Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis One out of every two of the 2.3 million persons with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS) report a fall in any given three- month period. The onset of MS is often during early or middle adulthood, making MS-induced falls a significant, long-term problem in need of new preventative interventions. Here we propose to advance several components of Just-In-Time Fall Prevention – a novel mHealth (mobile health) approach for preventing falls and to demonstrate each component in a sample of PwMS. The proposed mHealth system will be composed of wireless, wearable sensors and a mobile phone application. The wearable sensors will capture patient biomechanics and a network of statistical models, created using machine learning and deployed on the mobile phone, will predict fall risk based upon these measurements. Fall risk predictions will inform personalized interventions, delivered through the mobile application, that leverage strategies from social psychology designed to induce biomechanical and behavioral changes to immediately reduce fall risk. This approach enables real- time assessment and intervention to prevent future falls. Data to develop and pilot each component of this mHealth system will be collected in a study of N=50 PwMS that will a) capture concurrent measurements from wearable sensors, optical motion capture, force platforms, and an instrumented treadmill during functional assessments and simulated daily activities, b) track falls and objective biomechanical and behavioral measures during a 3-month in-home study, and c) assess the efficacy of point-of-choice prompts for altering fall-related biomechanics during balance-challenging daily activities. These data will be used to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) Validate wearable sensor algorithms for capturing biomechanics and behavior of PwMS, 2) Identify digital biomarkers for quantifying fall risk in real time during daily life in PwMS, and 3) Pilot point-of- choice prompts for inducing biomechanical changes in PwMS under realistic cognitive load. These aims are the first step toward our goal of developing a paradigm-shifting mHealth system for fall prevention and lead naturally to future R01 support for a randomized, controlled clinical trial testing the efficacy of this approach. This project will advance several components of a novel mobile health intervention for preventing falls. If successful, this approach has the potential to shift fall preventions efforts from reactive and physician centered to preventative and patient centered improving long-term health outcomes and quality of life for those with balance and mobility impairment.",Just-In-Time Fall Prevention: Development of an mHealth Intervention for Persons with Multiple Sclerosis,10251154,R21EB027852,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Car Phone', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Fall prevention', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Impairment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Social Psychology', 'Statistical Models', 'Study Subject', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Walking', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive load', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy testing', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'medical attention', 'mobile application', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'personalized intervention', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction', 'standard measure', 'treadmill', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,R21,2021,190266
"Predicting Relapse at the Time of Diagnosis in Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia PROJECT SUMMARY  Relapse is the major cause of cancer related mortality in children with leukemia. Despite improvements in overall survival for children with B-cell progenitor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), for the 600 patients who will relapse each year, half will die of their disease. The high mortality of patients who relapse underscores the need for improved risk prediction and treatment strategies to prevent recurrent leukemia. Current approaches to relapse prediction are limited by insufficient accuracy, delayed prediction and the inability to make actionable treatment adjustments based on prediction information. To address these limitations, we applied a single-cell, high-parameter proteomic approach to ALL patient samples at the time of diagnosis, accurately predicting future relapse based on the presence of pre-B cells with activated signaling. This approach was 38% more accurate than standard of care relapse prediction methods. We propose that identifying relapse-predictive cells in ALL at the time of diagnosis using their distinguishing proteomic and genetic features will result in a clinical risk prediction model that is accurate, immediate, and actionable. This approach to relapse prediction will change the clinical paradigm of relapse risk in ALL to reduce the incidence of relapse itself.  Using large multi-institutional, multimodal cohorts of molecularly and clinically annotated diagnostic patient samples, we will apply deep proteomic approaches to identify surface proteins uniquely expressed on relapse predictive pre-B cells enabling direct identification in a diagnosis sample. We will determine how genomic mutations associate with the presence of relapse predictive cells and examine their genomic mutational burden using single-cell exome sequencing. Finally, building on our data-driven, machine learning approaches, we will construct a diagnostic relapse predictor that is more accurate than standard of care models while informing on leukemia biology and targeted therapeutic options for patients at risk. This will enable a more precise approach to patient classification and treatment, reducing the number of children facing relapse and moving closer to precision medicine for children with ALL. PROJECT NARRATIVE Relapse remains a leading cause of death for patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Using single- cell studies of primary diagnosis samples from patients, we can identify cells responsible for future relapse at the time of diagnosis.

"Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality. Project Summary/Abstract  While exposure to high ambient temperature (i.e., heat) has long been recognized as a threat to public health, the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat- related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecasted extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and government officials. However, it is largely unknown: (1) what are the optimal metrics of heat stress to inform when to issue heat alerts, (2) how effective are heat alerts in protecting the public’s health and (3) what factors make heat alerts comparatively more or less effective in some places or in some people versus others. In the absence of such information, we will fail to maximize the public health benefits of heat alerts.  The goals of this proposal are to identify the optimal health-based and location-specific metrics for issuing heat alerts, to estimate the causal benefits of heat alerts, and to identify characteristics of individuals or communities associated with the greatest reductions in morbidity or mortality following heat alerts. Specifically, using national claims data on deaths and hospital admissions among the large, geographically diverse population of >60 million US Medicare beneficiaries age ≥65 years enrolled between 2001 and 2015, and on emergency department visits among >130 million participants of all ages from one of the nation’s largest health insurers, we propose to: (Aim 1) Use novel machine learning methods to identify the heat metric(s) (e.g., heat index, ambient temperature, spatial synoptic classification, wet bulb globe temperature, absolute humidity) that best predict excess heat-related deaths, emergency hospitalizations, and emergency departments visits in each location, (Aim 2) estimate the causal effects of NWS heat alerts on rates of mortality, hospitalizations, and emergency department visits across the country and within groups stratified by health outcome, sex, and age group, and (Aim 3) assess how the benefits of heat alerts vary across characteristics of communities.  Key innovations of this proposal include a very large sample size, geographic diversity encompassing the entire US, the assessment across multiple health endpoints and age groups, and the use of sophisticated methods in statistical learning and causal inference. Collectively, the findings from this proposal will provide meteorologists, public health and emergency management officials, and local policy-makers with critical information to better protect public health during extreme heat events and guide more targeted future research on strategies to mitigate the adverse health effects of heat. Project Narrative Extreme heat is recognized as an important threat to public health, and the burden of illness and death attributable to heat in the US remains high. In an effort to reduce heat-related mortality and morbidity, the US National Weather Service (NWS) issues heat alerts in advance of forecast extreme heat events to communicate these risks to the public and local government officials, although it remains largely unknown whether such alerts are effective in protecting people. We propose to provide forecasters and public health officials across the country with location-specific, health-based evidence as to the effectiveness of heat alerts and insights into how to improve them to better protect the public’s health.",Evidence to improve heat warning effectiveness in reducing morbidity and mortality.,10051418,R01ES029950,"['Age', 'Air Conditioning', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Government Officials', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Heat Stress Disorders', 'Hospitalization', 'Humidity', 'Individual', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Knowledge', 'Local Government', 'Location', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Policy Maker', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Seasons', 'Services', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Structure', 'Temperature', 'United States', 'Weather', 'age group', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'burden of illness', 'comparative', 'evidence base', 'extreme heat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'prevent', 'public health emergency', 'response', 'sex', 'statistical learning']",NIEHS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,627397
"Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices Project Summary/Abstract This is a project to develop new statistical methods for comparing groups of subjects in terms of health outcomes that are assessed using data from wearable devices. Inexpensive wearable sensors for health monitoring are now capable of generating massive amounts of data collected longitudinally, up to months at a time. The project will develop inferential methods that can deal with the complexity of such data. A serious challenge is the presence of unmeasured time-dependent confounders (e.g., circadian and dietary patterns), making direct comparisons or borrowing strength across subjects untenable unless the studies are carried out in controlled experimental con- ditions. Generic data mining and machine learning tools have been widely used to provide predictions of health status from such data. However, such tools cannot be used for signiﬁcance testing of covariate effects, which is necessary for designing precision medicine interventions, for example, without taking the inherent model selection or the presence of the unmeasured confounders into account. To overcome these difﬁculties, a systematic de- velopment of inferential methods for functional outcome data obtained from wearable devices will be carried out. There are three speciﬁc aims: 1) Develop metrics for functional outcome data from wearable devices, 2) Develop nonparametric estimation and testing methods for activity proﬁles and a screening method for predictors of activity proﬁles, 3) Implement the methods in an R package and carry out two case studies using accelerometer data. For Aim 1, the approach is to reduce the sensor data to occupation time proﬁles (e.g., as a function of activity level), and formulate the statistical modeling in terms of these proﬁles using survival and functional data analytic meth- ods. This will have a number of advantages, the principal one being that time-dependent confounders become less problematic because the effect of differences in temporal alignment across subjects is mitigated. In addition, survival analysis methods can be applied by viewing the occupation time as a time-to-event outcome indexed by activity level. For Aim 2, nonparametric methods will be used to compare and order occupation time distributions between groups of subjects that are speciﬁed in terms of baseline covariate levels or treatment groups. Further, a new method of post-selection inference based on marginal screening for function-on-scalar regression will be developed to identify and formally test whether covariates are signiﬁcantly associated with activity proﬁles. Aim 3 will develop an R-package implementation, and as a test-bed for the proposed methods they will be applied to two Columbia-based clinical studies: to the study of physical activity in children enrolled in New York City Head Start, and to the study of experimental drugs for the treatment of mitochondrial depletion syndrome. Project Narrative The relevance of the project to public health is that it will develop statistical methods for the physiological eval- uation of patients on the basis of data collected by inexpensive wearable sensors (e.g., accelerometers). By introducing methods for the rigorous comparison of healthcare status among groups of patients observed longi- tudinally over time using such devices, treatment decisions that can beneﬁt targeted populations of patients in terms of continuously-assessed health outcomes will become possible.",Inferential methods for functional data from wearable devices,10135813,R01AG062401,"['Acceleration', 'Accelerometer', 'Beds', 'Bypass', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Practices', 'Drug Combinations', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Head Start Program', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'New York City', 'Obesity', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Preschool Child', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Survival Analysis', 'Syndrome', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'circadian', 'data mining', 'design', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'indexing', 'interest', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'patient population', 'precision medicine', 'screening', 'sensor', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment group', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,298890
"Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations Randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for measuring the effect of a treatment or intervention. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test all research questions, whether due to cost, achieving sufficient subject sizes or when administering an arm of the trial would be unethical. To understand the effects of therapeutics, policy changes, and other interventions where it is not possible to administer a clinical trial, researchers have developed approaches that attempt to simulate clinical trials in observational data. Despite sophisticated statistical methodologies, it is not clear whether it is possible to reliably simulate a randomized controlled in observational data. We aim to quantify one potential driver of these different results, differences between the clinical trial and real-world populations. In Aim 1, we compare trials that have individual level data available to three real- world data sources. In Aim 2, we develop methodologies to infer most likely individual-level statistics from aggregate trial statistics using real world data. Finally, in Aim 3 we compare neurological trials that do not release individual level data to real world data. We then estimate the transportability of treatment estimates across different populations including: the population eligible for the trial in RWD and the population ineligible for the trial but receiving the treatment in RWD. This allows for the study of indication drift and treatment heterogeneity. By uncovering differences between these groups, we may be able to identify groups that are underrepresented in clinical trials to help reduce healthcare disparities. The K99/R00 award will allow me to gain expertise in using regulatory sciences (with mentor Dr. Florence Bourgeois and advisor Dr. Deborah Schrag) for biologic discovery (with mentors Dr. Tianxi Cai and Dr. Isaac Kohane) within neurology (with mentors Dr. Page Pennell and Dr. Clemens Scherzer). My background in statistics, informatics, genetics, and machine learning with clinical data sources ideally positions me for the proposed project. The proposed training plan, mentoring and project will provide a strong foundation for a successful transition to independent research. Clinical trial populations are a subset of the overall population and may be biased through several factors. To better understand disease, reduce healthcare disparities for underrepresented groups, assess drug approvals, and ensure safety as the indications for a drug expand it is critical to quantify how representative clinical trials are of the real-world population. Identifying enriched and underrepresented groups offers the opportunity to identify subpopulations who may have heterogeneous treatment effects and/or underlying physiologies.",Characterizing Population Differences between Clinical Trial and Real World Populations,10127341,K99NS114850,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age of Onset', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Approval', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Estrogens', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hormonal', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Insurance', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Menarche', 'Menopause', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Neurologic', 'Neurology', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perimenopause', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiology', 'Placebos', 'Policies', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Price', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Seizures', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tremor', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'arm', 'base', 'birth control', 'cost', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder subtype', 'disparity reduction', 'effectiveness analysis', 'efficacy clinical trial', 'glucosylceramidase', 'health care disparity', 'inclusion criteria', 'interest', 'member', 'multiple data sources', 'oncology trial', 'patient population', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'socioeconomics', 'standard measure', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'unethical']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,118759
"Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health) PROJECT SUMMARY  To expand the kidney-related biomedical workforce and counter the increasing disparity between the growing prevalence of renal disease and the disproportionate level of trainees, researchers and practitioners in nephrology and kidney health, we developed the Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health). ADVANCE Kidney Health is an education- based, hands-on research, education and clinical experience that applies pillars of 1) science, medical and engineering education; 2) training in innovation, entrepreneurialism and scientific translation; 3) experiential learning, mentorship and clinical immersion; and 4) needs-based application and practical translation – all aimed at producing motivated, trained and committed biomedical trainees interested in renal health and science to advance the workforce and develop the new health-related therapies of the future. The program recruits undergraduate students from across 15 departments within the College of Engineering at the University of Arizona (UArizona) that include: Biomedical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. ADVANCE Kidney Health is structured to provide trainees a medical school experience for early-stage undergraduate learners geared to instill an understanding of renal anatomy and kidney function. The core structure accesses a clinical experience to instill a motivation to pursue kidney- related patient care and/or translational research and progresses to an already established innovation bootcamp that culminates in an interdisciplinary capstone that has doubled in size over 10 years and accesses by more than 450 captive engineering students. The program leverages new infrastructure in medical and engineering education along with transdisciplinary programs aimed at innovation, technology development and entrepreneurialism with 15 physician navigators in kidney health and 23 engineering and scientific mentors spanning renal physiology, biomedical engineering, optical sciences and machine learning. The result is an interrelated program that bridges renal medicine, engineering and product development to develop new pipelines and on-ramps to impact career decisions and grow the future kidney-related workforce. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The prevalence of end-stage renal failure (ESRD) has increased ~40% over 20 years, but the kidney-related biomedical workforce has been unable to keep pace. New pathways to a career in nephrology and kidney-related medicine and research are vitally needed that combine early and frequent experiential opportunities to engage in patient-oriented kidney care and contribute to innovative technologies that will one-day change how renal dysfunction is diagnosed and treated. ADVANCE Kidney Health responds to this need by assembling diverse mentors, interdisciplinary infrastructure and novel engineering technologies to impact career trajectories and develop the new technological cures of tomorrow.",Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health),10230895,R25DK128859,"['Active Learning', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Arizona', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'Career Mobility', 'Caring', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Thinking', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Hypertension', 'Immersion', 'Infrastructure', 'Internal Medicine', 'Internships', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laws', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Motivation', 'Nephrology', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Problem Solving', 'Ramp', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Solid', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Universities', 'base', 'bridge program', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'career preparation', 'cohort', 'college', 'design', 'early experience', 'education research', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'graduate student', 'hands on research', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'kidney dysfunction', 'medical schools', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'product development', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'summer research', 'technology development', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R25,2021,140400
"Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is characterized by a vaginal microbiota with a low abundance of Lactobacillus spp. and higher abundances of anaerobic bacteria and affects nearly 30% of reproductive-age North American women and closer to 50% of sub-Saharan African women. BV is diagnosed by clinical observation of Amsel’s criteria (Amsel-BV), but treatment is only recommended when symptoms are reported, leaving a significant proportion of women untreated. Even with treatment, BV recurrence rates range from 50-70% within 6 months, increasing a woman’s risk of negative sequelae. Regardless of symptoms, BV is associated with serious adverse health outcomes, including preterm birth and HIV, and can seriously impact a woman’s quality of life. Ideal BV treatment would eliminate recurrence. The vaginal microbiome and microenvironment together provide a detailed evaluation of BV states, and hold key functional insights to predict and understand Amsel-BV recurrence. The goal of this proposal is to integrate and operationalize microbiome (metagenomes) and microenvironment (metabolomes and immune markers) data to develop a prognostic indicator of recurrent BV, and identify candidate biomarkers and causal mechanisms which reduce recurrence. Recent work by the PI functionally categorized the vaginal microbiome for use in large clinical research studies (vaginal metagenomic community state types, mgCSTs). The broad hypothesis in this proposal is that not all microbiomes associated with bacterial vaginosis have the same potential for recurrence. Preliminary data suggest that BV recurrence is more frequently observed in only two of the nine mgCSTs containing BV-associated bacteria. This study proposes to utilize archived cervicovaginal samples from the NIH 1999 Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora in which participants were followed quarterly for one year. Multi-omic analyses of baseline samples will be assessed to identify microbial (metagenomic and metabolomic) and host (metabolomic and targeted immune markers) signatures of susceptibility to recurrent BV. Specific aims of this proposal are to: (1) conduct an epidemiological analysis to evaluate the demographic and lifestyle correlates of mgCSTs, and (2) employ supervised machine learning and causal inference modeling to identify prognostic factors and drivers of the vaginal microbiome and microenvironment which lead to recurrent BV. Cases are defined as women with Amsel-BV at baseline, then clearance 3 months later, followed by recurrence at six months. Controls are women with Amsel-BV that do not experience recurrence within 9 months. This grant will support the PI’s training in epidemiology and biostatistics with the completion of a Certificate Program in Clinical Research. The PI’s long- term goal is to create an independent research program translating the basic science of the vaginal microbiome to improve women’s reproductive health outcomes. The Institute for Genome Sciences and the University of Maryland School of Medicine uniquely provide the resources and support required for successful completion of this proposal and the PI’s transition to an independent investigator. Emerging data suggest that a woman’s vaginal microbiome can protect her from acquisition of sexually transmitted infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and risk of pre-term delivery. This project will reveal how certain bacterial strains and concomitant host immune responses are associated with the recurrence bacterial vaginosis. This proposal will provide career development for the PI in clinical research, biostatistics, and epidemiology, and is relevant to the NIH’s mission to reduce infections and promote women’s health.",Integrating multi-omics data: Modeling biomarkers and mechanisms to reduce bacterial vaginosis recurrence,10282850,K01AI163413,"['Affect', 'African', 'Age', 'American', 'Anaerobic Bacteria', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Archives', 'Atopobium vaginae', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Vaginosis', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecology', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Hygiene', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Irrigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lactobacillus', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Maryland', 'Mentors', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pelvic Inflammatory Disease', 'Pelvis', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sex Behavior', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vagina', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'aged', 'candidate marker', 'career development', 'certificate program', 'cervicovaginal', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical translation', 'complex data', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data reduction', 'disorder risk', 'epidemiology study', 'genome sciences', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'model development', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'reproductive', 'research study', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vaginal microbiome', 'vaginal microbiota']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K01,2021,92865
"Functional Lung Imaging Using a Single kV CT Acquisition ABSTRACT Venous thromboembolism is a major global health and economic burden with about 10 million cases occurring every year, and a high lifetime risk of 8% after age 45 years. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a venous thromboembolic event associated with high morbidity and mortality, with about 20% incidence of death before diagnosis or shortly thereafter. Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a marked increase in patients presenting with acute pulmonary thromboembolic disease, most likely created when the infectious vasculitis involving the endothelium creates local arterial thrombosis and subsequent lung infarction, with a superimpose hypercoagulable state that promotes clot formation. In these patients, it is increasingly being recognized that pulmonary perfusion abnormalities associated with the lung consolidations and ground-glass opacities are important predictors of poor prognosis. Currently, pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) has become the preferred method for diagnosing PE and planar lung ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy is used in cases when pulmonary CTA is contraindicated. A compelling unmet clinical need is to develop a method for simultaneous pulmonary CTA and parenchymal perfusion assessment without the use of two modalities like CTA and SPECT perfusion in the same patient. In this project, an imaging physics-based deep learning method will be developed to extract the previously overlooked spectral information inherently encoded in the acquired contrast enhanced CT projection data. As a result of this breakthrough, this new spectral CT imaging method, referred to as Deep-En-Chroma, will be developed and validated for perfusion defect quantification in lung parenchyma from the currently available pulmonary CTA. This will be accomplished without the need for any expensive dual energy CT (DECT) hardware upgrades that have been commercialized by major CT manufacturers. In summary, upon the completion of this project, a new functional CT imaging method will have been developed, that in addition to providing the currently available pulmonary CTA images, will also detect perfusion defects in lung parenchyma without the requirement of high-end DECT hardware. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a venous thromboembolic event associated with high morbidity and mortality, with about 20% incidence of death.

"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior. Real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for individually tailored just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) based on empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for healthy eating and weight control.

"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction Project Summary Substance use disorders (SUDs) are increasing in prevalence and are already a leading cause of disability, due in part to the fact that our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is incomplete. Like most neuropsychiatric syndromes, SUDs are highly heterogeneous, and distinct mechanisms may be operative in some individuals but not in others, even within a single diagnostic category. Furthermore, SUDs frequently co- occur with depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric syndromes, complicating efforts to identify molecular and circuit-level mechanisms, and disentangle them from those involved in mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnostic heterogeneity is thus a fundamental obstacle to developing better treatments, identifying biomarkers for quantifying risk for different forms of addiction, and predicting treatment response and relapse. Recently, we developed and validated an approach to discovering and diagnosing subtypes of depression using fMRI measures of functional connectivity, which in turn predicted subtype-specific clinical symptom profiles and treatment outcomes. Here, in response to PAR-18-062, we propose a secondary data analysis that would extend this approach to SUDs, leveraging multiple deeply characterized and large-scale neuroimaging datasets. Our central hypothesis is that individual differences in mechanisms underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution (iRISA) are mediated by distinct forms of dysfunctional connectivity in addiction-related circuits, which in turn interact and give rise to distinct neurophysiological addiction subtypes. In Aim 1, we will use statistical clustering and machine learning methods to delineate these subtypes and optimize classifiers (fMRI biomarkers) for diagnosing them in individual patients, focusing initially on cocaine addiction. In Aim 2, we will validate these subtype-specific biomarkers by first replicating them in a new dataset and then evaluating their longitudinal stability and predictive utility. In Aim 3, we will test whether subtype-specific circuit mechanisms generalize to mediate iRISA functions in other forms of addiction, and define their interactions with distinct mechanisms mediating anhedonia and anxious arousal in patients with comorbid depression and anxiety. Project Narrative Biomarkers have transformed how physicians care for patients with cancer, cardiovascular disease, and a host of other medical conditions by providing quantitative tools for diagnosing disease processes and individualizing treatment decisions. In contrast, biomarkers for addictions remain relatively elusive. This project will test a new strategy for developing neuroimaging (brain scan) biomarkers for diagnosing novel subtypes of addiction in individual patients and then investigate how dysfunction in specific circuits gives rise to specific addiction- related behaviors and clinical symptoms.",Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for subtypes of addiction-related circuit dysfunction,10177987,R01DA047851,"['Abstinence', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Model', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Habits', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Motivation', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Transcend', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'addiction', 'animal data', 'anxious', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cocaine use', 'comorbid depression', 'comorbidity', 'craving', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'diagnostic platform', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug seeking behavior', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'negative affect', 'negative emotional state', 'network dysfunction', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'reinforcer', 'response', 'specific biomarkers', 'substance misuse', 'tool']",NIDA,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,603973
"Sensor-based Just-in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) Targeting Eating Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Long-term weight control is difficult to achieve and requires permanent changes in eating behavior. Emerging wearable sensor technology enables accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior, and real-time analysis of the sensor data paves the way for development of individually tailored and immediately delivered intervention (just-in-time adaptive Intervention; JITAI) to change eating behavior. Grounded in empirically and theoretically supported behavior change strategies for weight control, the proposed project relies on the synergy of wearable sensor technology, machine learning, behavioral science, personalized medicine, and nutrition to deliver and test such JITAIs. We previously developed a wearable sensor, the Automatic Ingestion Monitor (AIM), that automatically and accurately detects eating and characterizes meal microstructure (e.g., eating duration, rate of ingestion). These data can also be used to accurately estimate energy intake. The goals of this project are to: 1) use the AIM to study two common behavioral patterns observed among individuals with overweight/obesity, namely, excessive total daily energy intake (EI) and fast eating rate; 2) define the optimal personalized triggering metrics for two JITAIs targeting these behaviors; and 3) evaluate JITAIs’ effects on daily energy intake and targeted behaviors. In fulfillment of these goals, we will first conduct a study to characterize the target eating behaviors, then simulate and define triggering metrics for personalized JITAIs to change targeted eating behaviors and decrease EI. The JITAIs are rooted in self-regulation theory (SRT): setting a behavioral goal and monitoring progress toward that goal, with feedback to reinforce success. To enable the SRT-informed JITAIs, we will first use the AIM to collect data about ingestive behaviors quantified by objective, sensor-measured metrics from 90 adults with overweight/obesity who will wear the device for one week in free living conditions. Second, using the collected dataset, we will: a) analyze individual curves of cumulative daily EI and rate of eating within eating episodes to define triggering parameters for personalized JITAI delivery, and b) numerically simulate JITAI delivery and effects. We will then conduct a second study to evaluate the immediate effect of JITAIs on EI and ingestive behavior in free living participants. We will conduct a within-subjects trial with 128 adults wearing the AIM for 7 weeks. To personalize JITAIs, the AIM will learn individual eating patterns over a 1-week run-in period. Each JITAI will be delivered for two weeks (weeks 2-3 and 5-6) in a randomized crossover design with the resulting daily EI and ingestive behavior compared to baseline and the acceptability of the JITAIs assessed via questionnaire. On washout weeks 4 and 7, participants will continue to wear the AIM (no JITAIs) to assess persistence of intervention effects. The proposed project is the first step in demonstrating that AIM-based JITAIs can alter a variety of eating behaviors associated with excess EI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Achievement of changes in eating behaviors that facilitate long-term weight loss and maintenance is elusive. Emerging wearable sensor technology allows for accurate and objective measurement of ingestive behavior.

"Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data Abstract Poor cancers, lengthy, achieve diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors, the most prevalent risk factors for cardiometabolic diseases and can be treated to prevent disease. However, most diet, PA, and weight loss interventions are costly, and burdensome. Theseinterventions could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people a sustainable pattern of health behavior change so that treatment could be tapered and then stopped without behavioral relapse. Theories of habit formation might be assumed to address this problem, but they have not proved actionable to guide treatment decisions because they do not specify measurable criteria to reliably detect acquisition of a durable behavior pattern. Hence, we propose to identify behavior patterns that precede and predict maintenance of target-level behavioral improvement that persist after an intervention ends. The measurements needed to tell whether an intervention has durably entrained behavioral improvement are collected as part of diet, PA, and weight loss interventions. Specifically, participants continuously self-monitor their behavior digitally while assessments are relayed back to inform them about progress toward goals. We will analyze self-monitoring measures collected in 6 mHealth trials, conducted over 14 years among over 1,600 participants and more than 147,000 daily observations, to assess when an intervention has durably entrained targeted behaviors, as validated by their reliable persistence post- intervention. We will use location scale modeling to quantify change not only in the absolute level (location) of a behavior but also in its within-person variability (scale). We posit that the induction of durable behavior change requires both improvement in location (increases for healthy behaviors; decreases for unhealthy ones) and decrease in scale (i.e., increased behavioral consistency). Aim 1 will apply existing location scale methods to test the hypothesis that effective interventions will improve the location and reduce the scale of targeted behaviors across all trials. Because existing methods only measure scale at the group level and cannot measure the change in an individual's behavioral consistency that we need to personalize treatment adaptation, Aim 2 will extend location scale methods to enable individual estimation of the rate of change in behavioral consistency. Estimates derived from the new method will be analyzed to learn which parameters of behavior change during intervention are most associated with maintenance post-treatment. Finally, Aim 3 will apply machine learning to estimates from the extended location-scale mixed models to establish ranges and behavioral patterns that predict behavioral maintenance post-treatment. These resultswill inform behaviorinterventionscience and improve treatment efficiency by guiding real-timedecisions about the needed dosage and duration of behavioral treatments. Project Narrative Health promotion could be more cost-efficient if we could tell when people have established a durable behavioral change so that their treatment could be tapered with low risk of relapse. The project introduces a new method of quantifying improvement in both the absolute level and the day-to-day consistency of targeted behaviors to learn when healthy changes are likely to persist.",Methodological and data-driven approach to infer durable behavior change from mHealth data,10218158,R01DK125414,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diet', 'Diet Monitoring', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Promotion Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Individual', 'Intercept', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Psychological Theory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Science', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vegetables', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cancer risk', 'cardiometabolism', 'control theory', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'digital', 'dosage', 'effective intervention', 'exercise intervention', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'intervention cost', 'mHealth', 'personalized medicine', 'post intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'rate of change', 'relapse risk', 'theories', 'treatment duration', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,510240
"Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis ABSTRACT  Early detection of multiple sclerosis is key to limiting neurological damage but monitoring patient progression and response to therapy is of arguably similar if not greater importance due to the chronic nature of disease. Moreover, rates of non-adherence to therapy has been reported to be as high as 25% to 40% in the patient population suggesting the need to provide continuous monitoring and selection of optimal therapy. Identification of novel actionable biomarkers would provide clinicians with additional information for the purposes of diagnosis, prognosis, clinical subtyping as well as for the selection and monitoring of therapy. Initiation of sub-optimal therapy can be both detrimental to the patient’s health and financial well-being.  To date, the general approach to selecting a disease modifying treatment (DMT) is to weigh the risks and benefits while considering the aggressiveness of disease, efficacy of the drug and the potential side effects of treatment in a “trial and error” fashion. This approach is quite unsettling when understanding that treatment failure or inadequacy can cause irreversible neurological damage. Furthermore, many of these drugs are associated with serious adverse drug reactions such as cardiac events, opportunistic infections and secondary autoimmunity. Selection of the best therapy for a particular patient as well as the ability to identify if/when efficacy of a particular DMT dwindles is highly desirable and would be of great benefit throughout the healthcare spectrum. The course of MS disease does not manifest identically in all patients nor do all patients respond to treatment the same way. Identification of actionable biomarkers to serve as a surrogate for the efficacy of a particular therapy would allow clinicians to identify nonresponsive patients as early as possible and potentially evaluate dosing or administration to optimize patient outcomes.  Our previous work has explored lncRNAs as candidate biomarkers that can be measured in peripheral whole blood to accurately classify MS. The preliminary data provided in support of our fast track application highlights the potential for lncRNA expression levels analyzed with machine learning to not only classify MS but also indicate treatment responses. The emerging view by specialists that take care of patients with autoimmune diseases is that early diagnosis and early, aggressive and effective therapy is critical to produce the best long-term outcomes. This is very evident for multiple sclerosis with the goal of reducing damage to the central nervous system, producing longer and better disease remission, and mitigating long-term disability. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are newly discovered classes of RNAs with an array of regulatory functions. Our hypothesis to test is that classifiers can be built based upon differential expression of novel lncRNAs in blood. These classifiers will possess high levels of accuracy to monitor treatment responses in multiple sclerosis.",Long non-coding RNA signatures to track treatment responses in multiple sclerosis,10124273,R44AI145505,"['Adopted', 'Advocate', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Europe', 'Event', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Inflammatory', 'Invertebrates', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurologist', 'Oligoclonal Bands', 'Opportunistic Infections', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Site', 'Specialist', 'Spinal Cord', 'Suggestion', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Vertebrates', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adverse drug reaction', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'brain health', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'cost', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'drug efficacy', 'effective therapy', 'experimental group', 'health organization', 'human disease', 'learning classifier', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'phase 2 study', 'preservation', 'response', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"IQUITY LABS, INC",R44,2021,499995
"Data-Driven Learning Framework for Fast Quantitative Knee Joint Mapping PROJECT SUMMARY Osteoarthritis (OA), a leading cause of chronic disability in the elderly population, occurs with the degradation of the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage, mainly composed of proteoglycan, collagen fibers, and water. Early diagnosis of cartilage degeneration requires the detection of changes in proteoglycan concentration and collagen integrity, preferably non-invasively and before any morphological changes occur. Spin-spin relaxation time (T2) and spin-lattice relaxation time in the rotating frame (T1ρ) can provide quantitative information about the structure and biochemical composition of the cartilage before morphological changes occur. Mono-exponential (ME) models can characterize the T2 and T1ρ relaxation processes and map it for articular cartilage in the knee joint. A recent meta-analysis showed that T1ρ provides more discrimination than T2 for OA. However, the ME model alone cannot provide distinct information from different compartments of the cartilage. Recent studies have shown that T1ρ relaxation might have bi-exponential (BE) components, following the hypothesis of the multi- compartmental structure of the cartilage. BE T2 relaxation has shown better diagnostic performance than ME for OA and can show the dispersion of the relaxation times, reflecting the heterogeneity in the macromolecular environment of water in the cartilage. BE analysis of cartilage typically requires a larger number of acquisitions with different spin-lock times (TSLs) or echo times (TEs), resulting in long scan time. High spatial resolution is also needed to visualize the thin and curved cartilage and fine structures in the knee joint. As a result, in vivo application of BE three-dimensional (3D) T1ρ and T2 mapping techniques is still very limited. Compressed sensing (CS) combined with parallel imaging (PI) can accelerate acquisition and reduce the scan time required for ME 3D T1ρ and T2 mappings. T1ρ scans can be reduced from 30 min to ~3 min with an error smaller than 6.5%. However, the error is two to three times larger for BE mapping. This problem can be potentially solved by optimizing the sampling times (TSLs for T1ρ and TEs for T2) and the free parameters of the CS approach (k- space sampling pattern, regularization function, regularization parameter, and minimization algorithm parameters) using fully sampled 3D knee joint datasets, supported by machine learning tools. The overarching goal of this proposal is to develop, optimize, and translate a high-spatial-resolution, rapid 3D magnetic resonance imaging sequence using data-driven learning-based CS for assessment of the human knee joint and using ME and BE 3D T1ρ (T2) mapping for improved biochemical characterization of cartilage and menisci on a standard clinical 3T scanner. PROJECT NARRATIVE Osteoarthritis of the knee is a leading cause of disability in elderly people, and no curative treatments exist. Early detection of osteoarthritis might help delay or prevent the onset of disability later in life. We propose a rapid and robust approach for the quantitative multi-compartment assessment of knee cartilage without using either exogenous contrast agent or hardware modifications as an early screening tool for osteoarthritis.",Data-Driven Learning Framework for Fast Quantitative Knee Joint Mapping,10296235,R01AR078308,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Models', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Fiber', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Degradation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteoglycan', 'Protocols documentation', 'Relaxation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening procedure', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Water', 'articular cartilage', 'base', 'cartilage degradation', 'curative treatments', 'design', 'disability', 'early screening', 'efficacy evaluation', 'healing', 'human data', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'learning algorithm', 'macromolecule', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'repaired', 'tool', 'water environment']",NIAMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,531779
"Monitoring Lower Limb Movement to Predict Ambulatory Ability after Spinal Cord Injury After a spinal cord injury (SCI), clinicians must quickly decide where to focus therapy time to maximize an individual's functional mobility by discharge: either towards gait training or wheeled mobility interventions. Clinical prediction rules (CPRs) can assist clinicians in making those difficult decisions, but literature has shown that for individuals with moderate impairments, current CPRs that use age, strength, and sensation are not sufficient in predicting independent ambulation. Further, existing CPRs do not provide insight into clinically important descriptive measures of gait quality, efficiency, and endurance that contribute to functional ambulation. Our recent work demonstrated individuals who received gait training, but primarily used a wheelchair one year after SCI received less transfer and wheeled mobility training and had lower measures of participation than non-ambulatory individuals who never received gait training. In the context of decreasing inpatient rehabilitation length of stays, it is crucial that time in therapy be used efficiently to maximize function at discharge and avoid those long-term consequences.  Lower limb movement (LLM) captured using activity monitors may provide a more sensitive measure of strength and sensation than traditional methods such as manual muscle and light touch sensation testing. This technique is novel in that LLM has not yet been reported in literature for individuals with SCI. Our preliminary analysis has shown promise for the association between LLM, strength, and ambulatory ability (as defined by measures of gait quality, efficiency, and endurance). Using machine learning techniques, we are able to determine which factors have the strongest association with ambulatory ability, among LLM, subject demographics, clinical characteristics, and other covariates.  Our long-term goal is to improve CPRs that predict ambulation after SCI, thus enabling appropriately targeted functional mobility training. As a first step towards this goal, we will build a foundational knowledge of LLM and its relationship as a potential biomarker for ambulatory ability cross-sectionally among individuals with chronic SCI and known, diverse functional abilities (Aim 1). We will also explore longitudinal LLM data and ambulatory ability for a population with acute SCI (Aim 2) to evaluate changes in LLM over time and create a preliminary prediction model.  Achieving the proposed aims will provide new insights into factors that predict mobility in individuals with SCI and provide understanding as to how these factors change acutely following injury. Further, we will gain insight to guide a future multisite longitudinal study that will assess a new, more effective CPR. This CPR will aid clinical decision-making for individuals with SCI by allowing for optimally targeted therapies to be employed throughout the rehabilitation continuum, thus improving long-term functional outcomes. Project Narrative Current rules are not sufficient in predicting ambulation among individuals with moderate strength and sensory deficits after a spinal cord injury, and this can lead to an inefficient use of therapy time. By measuring actual lower limb movement using activity monitors, we believe we can capture an unexplained variance missing from current prediction models that use traditional clinical measures to more accurately predict ambulatory ability. Accomplishing the goals outlined in this proposal will provide clinicians with a better understanding of ambulatory prognosis after spinal cord injury and will allow for optimal target therapies to be employed throughout the rehabilitation continuum to maximize functional outcomes and quality of life.",Monitoring Lower Limb Movement to Predict Ambulatory Ability after Spinal Cord Injury,10049966,F30HD096828,"['Accounting', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Acute', 'Admission activity', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Caffeine', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Community Participation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Esthesia', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Occupations', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Probability', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sensory', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Wheelchairs', 'Work', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'demographics', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'functional outcomes', 'gait rehabilitation', 'improved', 'independent ambulation', 'indexing', 'insight', 'limb movement', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'spasticity', 'targeted treatment']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F30,2021,39636
"Development of personalized ex vivo predictive technology for rapidly matching patient tumors with chemotherapy regimens before treatment. Project Summary/Abstract Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is among the deadliest cancers with <9% five-year survival rate and an estimated 60,000 deaths/year by 2030. PDAC is often diagnosed at an advanced stage thereby precluding surgical resection for most patients. While new systemic therapy regimens have improved survival, availability of multiple options, without tools to select an optimal regimen from these (on an individualized basis), has created a frustrating paradox in clinical decision-making. Due to a lack of personalized predictive tools, current standard of care treatment strategy is based on prognostic factors such as age, stage, performance status, serum albumin, etc. There is a critical, urgent and unmet need to develop predictive tools that can identify optimal systemic therapy regimens and eliminate from consideration ineffective options, on an individualized basis, to improve quality of life and reduce overtreatment. CerFlux, Inc. is developing such predictive technology with its low-cost and rapid Personalized Oncology Efficacy Test (POET) to match each patient with the right treatment – before treatment – to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a difference in the lives of patients and providers around the world. Our personalized medicine approach is unique and further enhanced by a commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the James Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University. The proposed project will build on recent work by our team including a patented (US 10,114,010B1) biomimetic in vitro platform for pharmacological transport and pancreatic microtissue tumor models. The commercial goal of this proposal is to identify best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. Our hypothesis is that response to treatment observed in POET will approximate the response in the corresponding patient. Our objective is to predict both effective and ineffective treatments for each patient prior to initiating treatment. We propose the following aims to achieve our objective: Aim 1: Calibrate and optimize POET for evaluating therapeutics using human PDAC cell-line xenografts for subsequent testing with patient tissue. Aim 2: Evaluate efficacy of various systemic therapy agents in POET on an individualized basis to establish protocols and best practices for using POET in personalized therapy. We envision substantial continuing commercial-academic collaboration between CerFlux, Inc. and the James Comprehensive Cancer Center at the Ohio State University including the integration of machine learning to derive a “POET Score” – a personalized quantitative efficacy score – based on a combination of factors. Data from POET and the POET Score will help clinical teams rank treatments for individual patients before the first drug infusion. If successful, this SBIR-driven study has the potential to transform pancreatic cancer treatment in the near-term and make a positive impact around the world.

"TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS ABSTRACT There is a growing interest in dietary patterns that capture the overall quality of diet as well as its constituent foods and nutrients.

Numerous studies have shown that those dietary patterns were related to the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. However, none of these dietary patterns incorporates eating behavior such as when we eat (i.e., eating time) and how often we eat (i.e. eating frequency) during a day. Since the amount of foods and nutrients consumed at one eating occasion influences the food consumption at the subsequent eating occasion and overall intake of the day, eating time and frequency are integral parts of dietary patterns. Furthermore, several lines of evidence consistently suggest that eating time and frequency as well as a meal composition play roles in body weight regulation and metabolic health and also regulate circadian rhythms, all of which may lead to metabolic dysfunctions and ultimately chronic diseases. Given a clear need to expand the dietary patterns framework and close a gap in dietary patterns methodological work, we propose to 1) develop a “temporal” dietary patterns based on temporal distribution of eating time and frequency during a day; and 2) evaluate if the identified temporal dietary patterns are associated with i) overall diet quality and nutrient intakes, ii) adiposity (e.g., BMI, waist circumference), and iii) metabolic biomarkers (e.g., insulin, HOMA-IR, LDL-cholesterol, c-reactive protein). To overcome a limitation that a conventional statistical method cannot capture multidimensional aspects of temporal dietary patterns (e.g., 24-dimensional feature vectors, multivariate dietary intake time-series data), we will use a novel approach combining nutrition and systems science—machine learning method. The Interactive Diet and Activity Tracking in AARP (IDATA) study that repeatedly collected diet, anthropometry, and blood samples from 1,021 men and women, 50-74 years old will be used. During one year, the IDATA study collected 24-hour recalls with clock time for each eating occasion, every other month (total six 24-hour recalls); measured anthropometry three times (baseline and at month 6 and 12); and collected blood twice, 6-month apart. Successful completion of our proposed study will identify temporal dietary patterns that are related to diet quality and metabolic health and validate the utility of temporal dietary patterns as a new tool for future research on diet-health relations and prevention of chronic diseases. NARRATIVE Eating behaviors and its impact on health are complex and multidimensional. The proposed study provides an excellent opportunity to develop new dietary patterns that capture eating behaviors such as when we eat and how often we eat during a day. The findings of the study about healthy eating patterns will also improve dietary recommendations by adding messages on when and how often to eat during a day.",TEMPORAL DIETARY PATTERNS: DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION AGAINST ADIPOSITY AND METABOLIC BIOMARKERS,10053329,R01CA226937,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anthropometry', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Body Weight', 'Body mass index', 'C-reactive protein', 'Calories', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Evaluation', 'Fasting', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Health', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Intake', 'LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins', 'Lead', 'Macronutrients Nutrition', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediterranean Diet', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Nutrient', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'dietary', 'dietary guidelines', 'doubly-labeled water', 'epidemiology study', 'food consumption', 'good diet', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'obesity risk', 'prudent diet', 'tool', 'vector', 'waist circumference', 'western diet']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,224806
"Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression PROJECT SUMMARY Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate (SCC) white matter is an emerging new treatment strategy for treatment resistant depression (TRD) with published studies demonstrating sustained long-term antidepressant effects in 40-60% of implanted patients. Converging evidence from positron emission tomography (PET), electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion tractography (DTI) strongly suggests that DBS mediates its clinical benefits by direct modulation of the SCC--a key hub in an aberrant neural circuit. Despite encouraging sustained long-term effects in this notoriously difficult to treat patient population, randomized controls trials of SCC DBS and other DBS targets for TRD are now on hold as initial results failed to meet predefined clinical endpoints. While this proposal cannot address those failures directly, a clear necessary next step for effective future testing and eventual dissemination of this treatment is the need to develop brain-based biomarkers to guide lead placement and to titrate stimulation parameters during ongoing care. In the absence of such biomarkers to guide DBS use, there will continue to be variability in the implementation of clinical procedures during testing, leading to ambiguous and possibly misleading trial outcomes, and subsequent abandonment of a potentially useful treatment. To overcome these limitations, we propose to develop and test objective methods for reliable device configuration in individuals by optimizing DBS-SCC treatment with respect to human functional anatomy and key electrophysiological variables. We will leverage the capabilities of a novel bi-directional neuromodulation system (Medtronic RC+S) that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation to define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery. Ongoing measurements of SCC local field potentials (LFPs) will be combined with electroencephalography (EEG) and event related potential studies (ERP) performed as part of an experimental clinical trial of subcallosal cingulate DBS for TRD to identify an oscillatory signal that (1) is sensitive to changes in frequency and current parameters at the tractography defined optimal target and (2) tracks with depression state over time. Connectome-based and machine learning approaches will be used to define the most robust network biomarker and its response characteristics. Once defined, the control policy will be tested in a second phase feasibility study where parameters for initial stimulation will be selected based on the depression brain state biomarker and adjustments made to correct drift from the predefined target signal. If successful, the data- driven model and control strategy will enable objective, rational clinical programming of DBS stimulation for depression and provide a new model and approach for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment. . NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to refine and optimize deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subcallosal cingulate white matter for patients with treatment resistant depression. Using a newly available bi- directional neuromodulation system that allows live streaming of oscillatory activity at the site of stimulation, this study will define novel control strategies to guide programming decisions for DBS delivery providing a new evidence-based strategy for target identification, stimulation initiation and long-term monitoring and management of patients receiving this treatment.",Electrophysiological Biomarkers to Optimize DBS for Depression,9869948,UH3NS103550,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Devices', 'Diffusion', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Failure', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Resistance', 'Scalp structure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'algorithm development', 'antidepressant effect', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical implementation', 'connectome', 'control trial', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'implantation', 'improved', 'indexing', 'live stream', 'neural circuit', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'patient population', 'response', 'support tools', 'targeted biomarker', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'white matter']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,UH3,2021,1367977
"Predicting Short- and Long-term Future Occurrence of Atrial Fibrillation from Single-Lead ECG in Normal Sinus Rhythm with an Explainable Deep Learning Model. Project Summary/Abstract More than 30 million individuals worldwide are diagnosed with atrial fibrillation (AF), however, another 13% of individuals with AF are left undiagnosed. People with AF have a five-fold increased risk of stroke with up to one-third of all strokes shown to be related to AF. Timely administration of appropriate preventative therapies, especially anticoagulants, can significantly decrease the complications of AF, including strokes, by 65% and mortality by 30%. Digital health technologies offer new approaches to identify individuals with undiagnosed AF, in particular paroxysmal AF (PAF), characterized by occasional episodes of limited duration, for whom a 10-second 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG) performed in the clinical setting is unlikely to overlap with an AF event. Continuous monitoring is promising, but still costly and burdensome for elderly individuals, who are at higher risk. To maximize the diagnostic yield of these technologies, we propose novel methods to predict the future occurrence of AF from a single-lead ECG during normal sinus rhythm. Only recently it was shown that it is possible to predict the future occurrence of AF from 12-lead ECGs in normal sinus rhythm collected in a clinical setting. Here, we propose to predict the occurrence of AF with commercially available single- lead ECG devices, which will enable a scalable alternative for early detection in a non-clinical setting. To achieve this goal, we will analyze retrospectively the raw single-lead ECG data of 10,000+ individuals with PAF over 14 days of monitoring. Validation work will then be carried out in a unique set of 1,718 asymptomatic individuals who participated in the prospective mSToPS clinical trial of AF screening (mean age 73), with full clinical information and co-morbidities. The three aims of this project are:  1. Compute the probability of a future AF event in the short-term for an individual in normal sinus rhythm using classic single-lead ECG features and representation learning based features.  2. Develop a method for long-term prediction of AF onset by evaluating individuals with AF detected in 1, 3, 6 and 12 months from the initial monitored period of normal sinus rhythm and by validating the algorithms using the mSToPS dataset with 3 years of clinical follow-up and annotated co-morbidities.  3. Develop a technique to provide a preliminary interpretation of representation learning features for time-series data applied to the short- and long-term prediction. This retrospective study will develop and optimize new predictive techniques from single-lead ECGs, available through consumer devices, with the goal of identifying individuals at high risk of developing AF. A future direction to build on from this study's results would include a prospective study of AF prediction using consumer single-lead ECG to improve clinical outcomes. Project Narrative In this project we propose novel methods to predict the future occurrence of AF from single-lead ECGs during normal sinus rhythm, collected from commercially available single-lead ECG devices, which will enable a scalable alternative for early detection in a non-clinical setting.

"Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support PROJECT SUMMARY Treatments for mental health conditions such as unipolar depression provide modest average benefit but have wide variation between individuals and within individuals over time. Evidence-based customized treatment protocols would improve the mental health care of many people by providing treatment recommendations for individuals that take into account potential variation because of personal characteristics such as current health status, symptoms, and response to earlier treatment. Generating customized treatment protocols requires large amounts of data, such as from networks of health systems that can link electronic health records from millions of individuals. Current statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols are limited in three important ways.  First, current approaches rely on scientists to select the patient characteristics to use to customize treatments instead of using data to find the patient characteristics that will lead to improved, customized care. Second, customized treatment protocols discovered with current statistical methods assume no unobserved differences between individuals who receive various treatment options. Third, investigators do not have ways to know if the available data contain enough information to discover and compare customized treatment protocols precisely enough to make clinical decisions. We will address these three limitations by developing new statistical tools for discovering customized treatment protocols using electronic health records data. Our research team has expertise and experience in statistics, epidemiology, and mental health care. We will integrate methods that have been successfully used in other settings to improve statistical approaches for discovering customized treatment protocols and address these three important limitations.  We will extend machine learning tools for selecting important pieces of information to the time-varying data structure required for discovering customized treatment protocols. We will build approaches that use available knowledge about the size of unobserved differences between groups of people who received different treatments to assess how those differences change study results. By building on the math used to estimate the sample sizes needed for precision in randomized trials with complex designs, we will develop new formulas for determining how many people with a particular condition and who took a particular drug are needed in a health system to provide enough accurate information to discover customized treatment protocols.  Using data from the electronic health records of more than 15,000 patients, we will discover customized treatment protocols for depression. By improving statistical tools and addressing current limitations, our customized treatment protocols will have immediate impact for people living with unipolar depression. The statistical tools we develop will also be useful for discovering customized treatment protocols for people with a wide variety of mental health conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE People living with mental health conditions and their health care providers often lack evidence for making choices about numerous treatment options and they do not have evidence-based, customized treatment plans. This project will develop customized treatment plans for unipolar depression and methods to generate these plans using data from electronic health care records. This work will address current limitations in statistical methods for selecting patient characteristics for customizing treatment, assessing bias from differences between people who take different medications, and calculating how many people are needed to accurately compare customized treatment plans using data from electronic health records.",Improved tailoring of depression care using customized clinical decision support,10164627,R01MH114873,"['13 year old', 'Address', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Psychotherapy', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Sequential Treatment', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'data resource', 'data structure', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'practice setting', 'precision medicine', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,373803
"Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous, life-threatening condition defined by poor oxygenation and bilateral pulmonary edema that carries a mortality rate >40% in most studies. Every ARDS drug trial to date has failed, perhaps because the clinical criteria defining ARDS include a substantial subset of low-risk patients. Clinical scoring systems poorly predict which ARDS patients will develop prolonged respiratory failure and are at increased risk of death.  Molecular profiling of pulmonary edema fluid could serve as a window on the alveolar microenvironment, enabling identification of high-risk patients. Pulmonary edema directly reflects lung pathobiology including loss of barrier integrity, inflammation, and epithelial damage. Unfortunately, free-flowing pulmonary edema has limited clinical utility because it can only be captured in a minority of patients. Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema is now possible in every patient with ARDS because of two critical innovations. First, we discovered that edema fluid condensing in the HME (heat and moisture exchanger) filter of the ventilator circuit, usually discarded as trash, closely reflects free-flowing edema. Second, we developed a non-targeted metabolomic fingerprinting method using mass spectroscopy that characterizes molecular components in trace quantities of fluid. Together, these innovations make it possible to test the central hypothesis that molecular features of edema fluid reflect pathobiology and enable ARDS risk stratification.  To address the prognostic enrichment potential of HME edema fluid, 300 early ARDS patients will be recruited at 3 US centers, with protocolized HME edema fluid collection. Aim 1 is to study whether high HME edema fluid total protein and lung-injury specific proteins predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. Aim 2 is to test whether hypermetabolic edema fluid and inflammatory lipids predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. In Aim 3, LASSO machine learning will be used to integrate all proteomic and metabolomic edema features into a prolonged mechanical ventilation classifier. The robustness of the classifier will be assessed by measuring whether it adds prognostic value to clinical ARDS severity scores, identifying how well key molecular features are reflected in plasma, and testing for replication in an independent cohort.  The goal of these studies is to examine to what extent a novel and readily available lung-specific sample, obtained early in the course of ARDS, reflects biology and can predict ARDS outcomes, thus offering prognostic enrichment for future clinical trials. Successful completion of the Specific Aims offers the potential for a much-needed classification scheme to better refine, understand, and therapeutically-target ARDS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a common, life-threatening condition with no approved drug treatments. Pulmonary edema is a cardinal feature of ARDS and is mirrored closely by edema fluid collected passively in the Heat Moisture Exchanger (HME) filter; thus HME filter edema provides a novel and completely non-invasive window to the alveolar microenvironment. This proposal seeks to understand whether molecular characteristics of HME filter edema predict prolonged respiratory failure and could facilitate enrollment of high-risk patients into ARDS clinical trials.",Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung,10231005,R01HL152083,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bilateral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Electrons', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Ventilator', 'alveolar epithelium', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'epithelial injury', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'ionization', 'lung injury', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'receptor for advanced glycation endproducts', 'recruit', 'risk stratification', 'secondary outcome', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,539888
"Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation Dissociative symptoms in traumatized individuals are common, debilitating, and costly; however, little is known about how its biological mechanisms interact with PTSD treatment. Traumatic dissociation broadly encompasses a range of distinct, yet clinically interrelated symptoms: depersonalization, derealization, amnesia, numbing, flashbacks, passive influence phenomena, and identity disturbances. Either alone or in various combinations, these symptoms serve as diagnostic criteria and commonly associated features across multiple psychiatric disorders. Traumatic dissociation is also associated with significant personal and societal burden. Traumatized individuals with dissociative symptoms typically have co-occurring psychiatric conditions, high rates of self-destructive behaviors and suicidality, and are disproportionate treatment utilizers. In addition, they are at increased risk for attrition, non-response and relapse following treatment interventions. Despite the significant and disabling nature of traumatic dissociative symptoms, little is known about the neurobiology of these processes and targeted interventions do not exist.  PTSD treatment studies have neither looked at neural intermediate phenotypes of dissociation, nor how these are associated with psychophysiological and digital phenotypes. Compared to clinical symptom measures, these biological and in-the-moment digital markers of dissociation may more robustly map onto the underlying core aspects of the disorder differentiating dissociation subtypes following childhood and adult trauma. We propose to build upon our prior Exploratory R21 to now capture longitudinal multimodal phenotype data related to dissociation, pre-, post- and during PTSD treatment modalities that include empirically-derived, exposure-based components.  The goals of this study will be 1) to understand the differential biomarkers that map onto dissociative symptoms, and 2) to understand how these biomarkers may best predict trajectory of response to empirically based standard-of-care treatments. For each of these Aims, we will collect Neuroimaging, Physiology, and Digital Phenotyping data, applying computational modeling with multimodal data to provide machine-learning based, unbiased predictive models of dissociative intermediate phenotypes at baseline and longitudinally. This naturalistic study will allow us to map the biology of dissociation, and importantly, the change in dissociative symptoms and underlying biomarkers over time, using naturalistic evidenced-based treatment for PTSD in 130 treatment-seeking patients with PTSD, and a range of dissociative symptoms.  Successful completion of these Aims will provide a novel and powerful understanding of the biological markers of dissociation subtypes following trauma exposure, and will identify biological mechanisms for understanding and treating PTSD with dissociation. Pathological trauma-related dissociation is a significant personal and societal burden. This proposal will examine behavioral and biological correlates of dissociation across imaging, physiology, and digital assessments. Results from this proposal will inform how to identify those at risk for these debilitating symptoms, potential brain regions to target for treatment, and may support a new standard of clinical care for PTSD with dissociation. ",Multimodal Approaches to Neurobiology of Traumatic Dissociation,10129433,R01MH119227,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Amnesia', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Depersonalization', 'Derealizations', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dissociation', 'Dorsal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Exhibits', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Numbness', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychophysiology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reflex action', 'Refractory', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Self Destructive Behavior', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'digital', 'disabling symptom', 'emotion regulation', 'heart rate variability', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pediatric trauma', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'targeted biomarker', 'targeted therapy trials', 'time use', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,723138
"Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection Project Summary One of every 20 Americans develops colorectal cancer (CRC) and, once diagnosed, more than one-third will not survive 5 years. Although screening is available, stool assays such as fecal immunochemical test (FIT) have true positive rates ranging between 64-68% and false positive rate ranging between 5-10%. Moreover, other approaches such as colonoscopy are invasive and expensive and have low rates of patient adherence. There is clearly a need for improved non-invasive methods to screen individuals or subsequent colonoscopy. The current proposal describes using an innovative source of CRC-related biomarkers: the gut microbiome. This collection of bacteria inhabits the gastrointestinal tract and has largely been ignored in previous studies of the etiology and detection of CRC in humans. The long-term goal of this research is to develop biomarkers that improve the detection of CRC and to understand the mechanisms behind the biological changes that increase the risk of developing CRC. The objective of this proposal is to assess the use of microbiome-based fecal biomarkers of CRC. The central hypothesis is that development of colonic adenomas and carcinomas is in part mediated by the gut microbiome and that changes to the microbiome can be used to identify changes in health. Animal studies from have demonstrated that changes in the microbiome can lead to chronic local and systemic inflammation, which promotes the development of CRC. Through a recent collaboration with the University of Michigan members of the Early Detection Research Network Great Lakes New England Clinical Validation Center it was shown that the abundance of bacterial populations within intact feces could significantly improve the ability to detect CRC. The current proposal seeks to demonstrate that combining microbiome-based analyses with standard stool-based analyses will improve CRC detection. Three specific aims are proposed: (i) quantify the sensitivity and specificity of a combined FIT and microbiome model to improve the sensitivity and specificity of detecting SRN, (ii) assess the ability of residual FIT material to serve as a proxy for a whole fecal sample in detecting SRN, and (iii) measure the association between patient characteristics and model performance. The proposed research will yield a significant contribution because for the first time there will be a validated set of biomarkers for CRC that are based on the microbiome that approach the predictive value of colonoscopies for a fraction of the cost. The proposed research is innovative because of its scope, target population and ability to link microbiome composition with a physical sample, access to patient clinical data, and potential opportunities to incorporate data from parallel biomarker validation studies that have used the same samples. Successful completion of these aims will yield a significant translational step in the detection of colonic adenoma with a very real opportunity to develop a robust panel of microbial biomarkers that complement existing technologies. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will yield a significant translational step in the early detection of colon cancers leading to reduced mortality. We seek to improve detection by developing microbiome-based biomarkers that can be screened using a non-invasive approach. Thus the research is relevant to the part of NCI’s mission to support research into the diagnosis of cancer.",Identification of Microbiome Based Markers to Improve Colorectal Cancer Detection,10082437,R01CA215574,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'American', 'Animals', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Body mass index', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon Carcinoma', 'Colonic Adenoma', 'Colonic Diseases', 'Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'High grade dysplasia', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Large Intestine Carcinoma', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Materials Testing', 'Measures', 'Meat', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasms', 'New England', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Participant', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proxy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resected', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Somatic Cell', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Work', 'adenoma', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker validation', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cohort', 'colon cancer screening', 'colon carcinogenesis', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'fecal microbiome', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'screening', 'stool sample', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'validation studies']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,319318
"Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT Keratoconus is a degenerative disease of the cornea that is a major cause of reduced vision-related quality of life in the United States, often leading to corneal transplantation. Ectasia after refractive surgery is a vision-threatening complication that can occur in apparently low-risk patients despite current screening technology. The biomechanical properties of the cornea play a central role in these diseases, but diagnostics are still rooted in shape measures because doctors lack direct measures of biomechanical change. While several methods have shown early promise for addressing this gap, most require contact with or perturbation of the cornea, cannot spatially resolve biomechanical properties, or involve expensive optical systems.  To address the need for direct biomechanical measurement of the cornea and the limitations of other approaches, we introduce phase-decorrelation OCT (phd-OCT). Phd-OCT makes use optical coherence tomography (OCT) to quantify random nanoscale mobility that is related to the strength and cohesion of the cornea. Preliminary results strongly support the rationale, feasibility and potential advantages of the approach. Our objectives are: (1) to refine our method to optimize detection sensitivity and speed, and (2) to determine if the technique is clinically useful. We will achieve these objectives through the following aims: 1. To develop and validate mobility-sensitive phd-OCT for corneal imaging. Spectral-domain OCT will be used for anterior segment phase-decorrelation imaging and the analysis algorithm will be optimized. The system will be validated using phantoms and torsional rheometry. 2. To investigate the potential influence of physiological factors (intraocular pressure (IOP), hydration, and temperature). Factorial design experiments in porcine and human donor globes will establish the sensitivity of phd-OCT measurements to potential confounders. 3. To develop and validate data acquisition and processing methods to enable clinical testing. GPU processing and machine learning will be configured to minimize processing time. Scan patterns will be optimized to minimize scan time and return clinically useful data. 4. To assess feasibility and preliminary diagnostic performance of clinical mobility-sensitive OCT imaging of the cornea. A first-in-human study will characterize repeatability and test the hypotheses that phd-OCT mobility measurements are increased in the region of a LASIK flap and decreased in CXL.  Expected Outcomes: The proposed studies will establish a new, non-contact method for imaging corneal biomechanical properties with the potential to address many shortcomings of current and emerging methods. Success could lead to earlier detection of of ectasia risk and allow more appropriate timing and customization of corneal treatments. Future integration of data into computational models has the potential to greatly impact the field by driving a shift from empirical planning and risk analysis to patient-specific strategies. The mechanical properties of the cornea, the transparent front of the eye, are important for diseases that affect vision as well as for corrective treatments like crosslinking therapy and LASIK. We have developed a new optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based method to detect and map corneal mechanical properties that has advantages that may make it readily translatable to clinical use. The objective of this proposal is to determine whether this technique is clinically feasible and useful by refining the technology, testing it in animal and human donor corneas, and performing studies in patients with corneal conditions of interest.",Noninvasive assessment of the cornea by diffusion OCT,10171859,R01EY028667,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biomechanics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complication', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Models', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Image', 'Keratoconus', 'Keratoplasty', 'Laser In Situ Keratomileusis', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathological Dilatation', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Surgical incisions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Torsion', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visual impairment', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohesion', 'computerized data processing', 'crosslink', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'design', 'detection sensitivity', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'mechanical properties', 'nanoscale', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NEI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,381543
"Development of quantitative tools to predict patients with difficult intubation to minimize treatment related complications ABSTRACT Endotracheal mouth/nose breathing need 10% this to performing subjective poorly standard Unfortunately, these airway examination systems in clinical practice perform only modestly, with sensitivities of 20-62%, specificities of 82-97%, and very low positive predictive values, generally less than 30%, unless very liberal definitions of difficulty are used. There are likely a number of reasons for this poor performance, including the relative rarity of difficult intubation, the multifactorial etiology and varying definition of difficult intubation, inter-observer variability in test results, failure to validate potential systems in patients independent of those used to derive the test, and the inadequacy of the tests themselves. intubation (EI) is a common medical procedure in which a plastic tube is introduced via the into the trachea, to provide respiratory support during general anesthesia or to ameliorate difficulty in cases of respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or other forms of critical illness. The global for EI is likely at least 150 million based on the WHO estimate of surgical need worldwide. Approximately  of EI attempts are difficult, and approximately 1/2000 are deemed impossible. The clinica l significance of “can't intubate, can't ventilate” scenario is extremely important: 25% of anesthetic related deaths are due airway mishaps. Patients are typically assessed for anatomic features that might predict difficulty in EI prior to the procedure. In practice, anesthesiologists and other airway experts likely weigh other factors in anticipating a difficult airway, including habitus, facial appearance, and perhaps other understood hunches.

"Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease Project Summary Diarrheal diseases lead to an estimated 2.4 billion episodes of illness and 1.3 million deaths each year, with the majority of those deaths occurring in adults, adolescents, and children over five years. As the severity of diarrheal diseases can vary widely, accurately assessing dehydration status remains the most crucial step in preventing morbidity and mortality. While patients with severe dehydration require hospital admission and immediate resuscitation with intravenous fluids to prevent hemodynamic compromise, organ ischemia, and death, those with mild to moderate dehydration can be treated in outpatient settings with relatively inexpensive oral rehydration solution. Yet, while several tools have been validated for use in children under five years of age, no clinical diagnostic tool has ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Differences in both adult physiology and diarrhea etiology may compromise the accuracy of clinical diagnostic models developed for use in young children. The proposed research will derive the very first age-specific clinical diagnostic models created for the assessment of dehydration status in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea, incorporate those models into a new mobile health (mHealth) tool, and validate the performance of this tool in a new population of patients with acute diarrhea. To accomplish this task, we will enroll a prospective cohort of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea presenting to the rehydration unit of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b) in Dhaka, Bangladesh and collect data on presenting clinical signs and symptoms shown to correlate with dehydration severity in prior studies. We will then employ machine learning techniques to derive age-specific clinical diagnostic models for assessing dehydration in patients over five years of age with acute diarrhea. We will conduct formative research among clinicians working at icddr,b to develop an innovative mobile phone based platform which will incorporate these new age-specific diagnostic models for rapid use by frontline health workers. Finally, we will validate both the accuracy and reliability of the newly developed mHealth tool in a new population of adults and children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. Once developed and properly validated, this novel mHealth tool has the potential to help physicians, nurses, and other healthcare providers more accurately diagnose dehydration severity and better determine the optimal management strategy for patients with acute diarrhea. Improved diagnostic approaches may in turn be shown to reduce both the morbidity and mortality that occurs as a result of missed diagnoses of dehydration, as well as the adverse events and inappropriate utilization of limited healthcare resources that can result from inaccurate diagnoses of dehydration. Project Narrative Dehydration due to diarrheal diseases remains a leading cause of death in both children and adults worldwide, yet no clinical tools have ever been validated for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults or children over five years of age with acute diarrhea. The proposed research will both develop and validate an innovative new mobile phone based platform for the assessment of dehydration severity in adults, adolescents, and older children with acute diarrhea. This new mobile health tool will help physicians, nurses, and other providers worldwide to determine the best management strategies for patients with acute diarrhea, potentially improving and rationalizing care for the hundreds of millions of patients each year presenting to healthcare facilities around the world with acute diarrhea.",Development of a novel mobile health tool for age-specific dehydration assessment and management in patients with diarrheal disease,10202572,R01DK116163,"['5 year old', 'Acute Diarrhea', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Bangladesh', 'Beds', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diarrhea', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'IV Fluid', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'International Unit', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nurses', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort', 'Provider', 'Rehydration Solutions', 'Rehydrations', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical examination', 'clinical predictors', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diarrheal disease', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'international center', 'low and middle-income countries', 'mHealth', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,R01,2021,546783
"A study of antibiotics usage on early gut microbiome colonization and establishment in young children PROJECT SUMMARY The emergence and transmission of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is currently one of the most critical public health threats. As such there is an urgent need to identify new ways to reduce AMR transmission. In recent years, several studies have started to reveal the complex relations and interactions between antibiotics, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) and the human microbiome. The human microbiome plays profound roles in responding to antibiotic treatment and the transmission of ARGs. The altered microbiome, especially in children, may have a distinct resistome (the entire ARGs in the microbiome community). Infants and young children receive frequent antimicrobial courses for common respiratory infections and are thought to spread ARGs effectively in the community. Otitis media is the most common reason for antimicrobial treatment in children. The antibiotic treatment that is selected for use in young children may significantly influence AMR spread in the communities. To date, there are a limited number of prospective, controlled comparative studies on how selected antibiotics affect the development of antibiotic resistance in the microbiome in young children. It is not possible to investigate children in an experimental way and expose them to antibiotics without an indication for the treatment. Non-severe acute otitis media, however, is an excellent clinical model to investigate the impact of different antimicrobial agents, since clinical guidelines suggest several alternative approaches to treat children, including watchful waiting without antibiotics. In this study, we will investigate the impact of the most commonly used antibiotics on the intestinal microbiome, and in particular the resistome in children with otitis media. The Oulu University study is IRB approved and has started enrolling infants and young children with non-severe otitis media in a study cohort and plan to finish the enrollment within the first few months of this project. Children are randomly allocated in four antibiotic treatment groups to compare the impact of amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, azithromycin, or no treatment on the intestinal microbiome and ARGs. We will solicit the antibiotic exposure during lifetime and collect stool samples before (day 0) and three days after the antibiotic course (day 10). We will apply quantitative PCR, 16S rDNA and metagenomic sequencing on different platforms to characterize the microbiome and resistome over time. De novo genome assembly based on Oxford Nanopore long reads technology, combined with high depth Illumina sequencing will reveal the details of ARGs and gene variants between species, and between microbiome communities, and show us novel mobile elements containing ARGs, which may be potentially transferred horizontally between species. We will apply machine learning approaches to quantitatively study how each bacterial species responds to and survives under antibiotic exposure, by analyzing genomic variants in ARGs, changes in three dimensional structure of the key ARGs, ARG network and pathways. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant bacteria are a growing threat for public health. This proposal involves a randomized, controlled study of how the human microbiome in young children responds to different antimicrobial agents and will reveal possible genomic mechanisms by which this occurs thereby providing insight into potential new approaches to address the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria.",A study of antibiotics usage on early gut microbiome colonization and establishment in young children,10113538,R21AI151730,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Amoxicillin', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Azithromycin', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Child', 'Clavulanate', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Infant', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intestines', 'Invaded', 'Machine Learning', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Otitis Media', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient observation', 'Pattern', 'Plasmids', 'Play', 'Preventive measure', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recombinant DNA', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Universities', 'antimicrobial', 'antimicrobial drug', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'clinical care', 'colonization resistance', 'design', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'fecal microbiome', 'genetic variant', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'insight', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiome research', 'nanopore', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'randomized controlled study', 'recruit', 'resistance gene', 'stool sample', 'three dimensional structure', 'transmission process', 'treatment arm', 'treatment choice', 'treatment group']",NIAID,"J.

"Monitoring mosquito eco-systems and vector-control strategies using a stand-off optical sensor. Monitoring mosquito ecosystems and vector-control strategies using a stand-off optical sensor.  PI: B. Thomas – NIH R21 Project Summary:  Vector control strategies remain one of the most effective ways to protect human populations from the large number of mosquito borne diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, zika virus, or West Nile virus. Mosquito populations are generally monitored using physical traps, however this method suffers from many disadvantages. It requires long and expensive laboratory analysis by qualified personnel which drastically reduces the number of observed insects as well as time of trap deployment. Traps also provide a poor estimate of the actual population size or population density because the attractive range of traps is generally unknown and may change with weather conditions. These limitations are strong drawbacks in our ability to evaluate the effectiveness of various types of vector-control strategies (chemicals, biological, environmental modifications etc.). Inferior methods are not necessarily identified which ultimately contributes to the spread of infectious diseases. In this context, we argue that new methodologies to monitor insect population dynamics is key in the necessary effort to improve control program performance.  A team from the New Jersey Institute of Technology in collaboration with the Hudson Mosquito Program seeks support to carry out a series of field experiments using a new optical sensor capable of identifying in real-time the family, species, and gender of mosquitoes in its field of view. The laser-based instrument is a dual-wavelength polarization-sensitive stand-off sensor. For each flying insect transiting through the infrared laser beams, the sensor can retrieve the optical properties of the wings and body of the insect as well as its wing beat frequency. Preliminary data from a laboratory prototype and numerical simulations indicate that the instrument, using a supervised machine learning classifier, can identify the species, gender, and gravidity of mosquitoes up to 300 m away. The instrument will be deployed in a high mosquito density area in New Jersey to continuously monitor the mosquito population over the whole season from April to October 2021. Continuous measurements will allow to identify a number of insects that is orders a magnitude higher than physical traps. As the probed volume of air is known, data analysis will provide the population density for each class of insects from which the population dynamics will be derived. In addition, the time and date of each insect transit allow to study the circadian rhythm, peak activities, and behavior as a function of atmospheric conditions measured by a weather station. In 2022, a similar experiment will be conducted at the same location while the Hudson Mosquito Program will conduct a vector control campaign targeting Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, both responsible for the spread of various infectious diseases. The impact of multiple applications of airborne pyrethroid insecticide on targeted and non-targeted insects will be evaluated by studying the mortality rates and population dynamics for each species. Both years, the data will be compared to physical traps on site, the current gold standard method, for further analysis and validation. Project Narrative  Mosquito-borne diseases are a major challenge for Human health as they affect nearly 700 million people every year and result in close to one million deaths; however, lack of reliable data on mosquito populations has become a serious obstacle to evaluate the effectiveness of vector control programs. The proposed study will make use of a new methodology based on applied optics to remotely count and identify in real-time the species and sex group of flying mosquitoes in their natural habitat. This novel methodology will be used to evaluate the impact of insecticide applications on the population dynamics of key vector of infectious diseases.",Monitoring mosquito eco-systems and vector-control strategies using a stand-off optical sensor.,10215105,R21AI153732,"['Aedes', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Controlled Environment', 'Culex (Genus)', 'Culicidae', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dengue Fever', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Family', 'Female', 'Flying body movement', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Gold', 'Gravidity', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Inferior', 'Insecta', 'Insecticides', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Location', 'Malaria', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mosquito-borne infectious disease', 'New Jersey', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Population Dynamics', 'Population Sizes', 'Price', 'Property', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Seasons', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Weather', 'West Nile virus', 'Wing', 'Zika Virus', 'atmospheric conditions', 'base', 'density', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy evaluation', 'egg', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning classifier', 'mortality', 'novel', 'optical sensor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'pyrethroid', 'rate of change', 'sensor', 'sex', 'simulation', 'supervised learning', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,NEW JERSEY INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2021,187106
"Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors PROJECT SUMMARY In this Industry-Academic partnership R01 research plan, we propose the development, optimization, and pilot first-in-human evaluation of a bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation (MWA) system for rapid and conformal thermal ablation of early stage pulmonary tumors. Minimally-invasive, image- guided MWA is a cost-effective treatment for thermal destruction of unresectable tumors in the liver, lung, kidney, and other organs. Current MWA technology for pulmonary tumors is limited to a percutaneous approach, which precludes treatment of central tumors and has a high associated risk of pneumothorax. Furthermore, limited intra-procedural feedback and lack of guidance and treatment planning tools places a substantial burden on the physician to precisely position applicators and ensure adequate ablation of the target, while limiting damage to non-targets. Virtual bronchoscopy and navigation, pioneered by Broncus Medical (industrial partner), affords accurate, minimally-invasive access to early-stage pulmonary tumors, with minimal risk of pneumothorax, compared to a percutaneous approach. The team at Kansas State University (academic partner) will develop optimized flexible microwave applicators for delivering localized thermal ablation to pulmonary tumors via a bronchoscopic approach. The proposed MWA devices include antennas with directional control of microwave power deposition for precise ablation of small targets, and will be extensively evaluated with computational models and experimentally, on the benchtop, and in an in vivo animal model. Transient changes in antenna impedance matching will be exploited as a feedback parameter for assessing ablation progress. A machine-learning based treatment planning and guidance platform will be developed and integrated with Broncus’ Archimedes planning and virtual bronchoscopy platform to guide the selection of optimal treatment parameters. The integrated system will be translated for first-in- human studies to evaluate the feasibility and safety of bronchoscopically delivering MWA for targeting pulmonary tumors (subaward with University of British Columbia, through Broncus Medical). The central hypothesis of this research is that a bronchoscopic MWA system integrating: (1) applicators with directional control of ablation profiles; (2) impedance-based intra-procedural feedback; and (3) bronchoscopic guidance and treatment planning tools, will afford the safe and effective treatment of localized early-stage pulmonary tumors. The proposed research will lead to the development of an integrated system for bronchoscopic ablation of pulmonary tumors, and its pilot feasibility assessment in human patients. If successful, this work will considerably expand the range of patients with lung tumors that can be treated with a cost-effective, minimally-invasive approach. PROJECT NARRATIVE Microwave ablation (MWA) is a minimally invasive treatment option for thermal destruction of tumors, that is in clinical use for treating tumors in the lung with a percutaneous approach. If successful, this research will lead to the development and first-in-human evaluation of MWA devices that can be delivered through a bronchoscope, and integrated with an image-guidance and treatment planning platform.",Bronchoscope-guided microwave ablation of early-stage lung tumors,10065497,R01CA218357,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'British Columbia', 'Bronchoscopes', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heating', 'Human', 'Incineration', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Kansas', 'Kidney', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Nodule', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Nonionizing Radiation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumothorax', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Unresectable', 'Work', 'animal data', 'base', 'computerized', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effective treatment', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'efficacious treatment', 'efficacy outcomes', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'image guided', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung preservation', 'microwave ablation', 'microwave electromagnetic radiation', 'minimal risk', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pre-clinical', 'pulmonary function', 'real time monitoring', 'safety and feasibility', 'simulation', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor ablation', 'virtual']",NCI,KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,236163
"Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Efforts to include behavioral measures in large-scale studies as envisioned by precision medicine are hampered by the time and expertise required. Paper-and-pencil tests currently dominating clinical assessment and neuropsychological testing are plainly unfeasible. The NIH Toolbox contains many computerized tests and clinical assessment tools varying in feasibility. Unique in the Toolbox is the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB), which contains 14 tests that take one hour to administer. CNB has been validated with functional neuroimaging and in multiple normative and clinical populations across the lifespan worldwide, and is freely available for research. Clinical assessment tools are usually devoted to specific disorders, and scales vary in their concentration on symptoms that are disorder specific. We have developed a broad assessment tool (GOASSESS), which currently takes about one hour to administer. These instruments were constructed, optimized and validated with classical psychometric test theory (CTT), and are efficient as CTT allows. However, genomic studies require even more time-efficient tools that can be applied massively.  Novel approaches, based on item response theory (IRT) can vastly enhance efficiency of testing and clinical assessment. IRT shifts the emphasis from the test to the items composing it by estimating item parameters such as “difficulty” and “discrimination” within ranges of general trait levels. IRT helps shorten the length of administration without compromising data quality, and for many domains leads to computer adaptive testing (CAT) that further optimizes tests to individual abilities. We propose to develop and validate adaptive versions of the CNB and GOASSESS, resulting in a neurocognitive and clinical screener that, using machine learning tools, will be continually optimized, becoming shorter and more precise as it is deployed. The tool will be in the Toolbox available in the public domain. We have item-level information to perform IRT analyses on existing data and use this information to develop CAT implementations and generate item pools for adaptive testing. Our Specific Aims are: 1. Use available itemwise data on the Penn CNB and the GOASSESS and add new tests and items to generate item pools for extending scope while abbreviating tests using IRT-CAT and other methods. The current item pool will be augmented to allow large selection of items during CAT administration and add clinical items to GOASSESS. New items will be calibrated through crowdsourcing. 2. Produce a modular CAT version of a neurocognitive and clinical assessment battery that covers major RDoC domains and a full range of psychiatric symptoms. We have implemented this procedure on some CNB tests and clinical scales and will apply similar procedures to remaining and new tests as appropriate. 3. Validate the CAT version in 100 individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders (PS), 100 with depression/anxiety disorders (DA), and 100 healthy controls (HC). We will use this dataset to implement and test data mining algorithms that optimize prediction of specific outcomes. All tests, algorithms and normative data will be in the toolbox. Creating an adaptive screening tool for detecting neurocognitive deficits and psychopathology across the lifespan Narrative Large scale genomic studies are done in the context of precision medicine, and for this effort to benefit neuropsychiatric disorders such studies should include behavioral measures of clinical symptoms and neurocognitive performance. Current tools are based on classical psychometric theory, and we propose to apply novel approaches of item response theory to develop a time-efficient adaptive tool for assessing broad neurocognitive functioning and psychopathology.

"Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm PROJECT SUMMARY The development of large observational health databases (OHD) has expanded the data available for analysis by pharmacoepidemiology research. The efficiency of these studies may be improved by simultaneously studying the association of multiple medications with a disease of interest. Unfortunately, prior research has demonstrated that it is difficult to distinguish true-positive from false-positive results when studying multiple exposures simultaneously, thus limiting the conclusions drawn from these types of studies and representing a major gap in the field. The objective of this proposal, which is the first step in achieving the applicant's long- term goal of improving the diagnosis and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases using insights derived from OHD, is to evaluate and validate medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA), a novel set-based signal-to- noise enrichment algorithm developed by the applicant to analyze multiple exposures from OHD with high sensitivity and specificity. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that MCEA has equal sensitivity and greater specificity compared to logistic regression, the most widely used analytic method for OHD, for identifying true associations between medications and clinical outcomes. The applicant will complete the following two interrelated specific aims to test the hypothesis: Aim 1 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of medication class enrichment analysis (MCEA) and logistic regression (LR) for identifying medication associations with Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and Aim 2 – to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of MCEA and LR for identifying medication associations with gastrointestinal hemorrhage (GIH). The rationale for these aims is that by reproducing known medication-disease associations without false positives, MCEA can be used to identify novel pharmacologic associations with gastrointestinal diseases in future studies. The expected outcome for the proposed research is that it will demonstrate MCEA as a valid method for pharmacoepidemiology research, opening new research opportunities for the study of multi-exposure OHD. These new research opportunities may lead to more rapid identification of potential pharmacologic causes of emerging diseases and discovery of unanticipated beneficial medication effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications. To attain the expected outcome, the applicant will complete additional coursework that builds on his Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology to learn computational biology, machine learning, and econometrics techniques. With the support of this grant and his institution, he will also directly apply these techniques to pharmacoepidemiology applications under the close mentorship of a carefully selected team of faculty with extensive experience in gastroenterology, pharmacoepidemiology, medical informatics, and mentoring prior K-award grant recipients. Through these activities, the applicant will develop the skills necessary to obtain NIH R01-level funding and become a leader in developing novel techniques for application to the epidemiologic study of gastrointestinal diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traditionally, research studying medications associated with diseases are limited to analyzing one medication at a time. This novel proposal will validate medication class enrichment analysis, a recently developed algorithm to study multiple medications simultaneously for association with a disease of interest. Validation of this method will allow researchers to use existing medical databases to more rapidly identify potential medication causes of emerging diseases and identify medications with unanticipated beneficial effects, allowing such medications to be repurposed for new indications.",Evaluation of multiple medication exposures concurrently using a novel algorithm,10128442,K08DK119475,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Aminoglycosides', 'Antibiotics', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Carbapenems', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cephalosporins', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clostridium difficile', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Fluoroquinolones', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Noise', 'Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Outcome', 'Penicillins', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'beta-Lactams', 'career development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'econometrics', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'research study', 'simulation', 'skills', 'usability']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K08,2021,167900
"Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis Abstract Our overarching goal is to develop minimally invasive approaches to better predict outcome and novel mechanisms in alcoholic hepatitis (AH). AH is characterized by acute hepatic decompensation and multiple organ failure. Although supportive care for AH has improved, short-term mortality has largely remained unchanged (30-40%) for decades. Effective approaches to predict risk hamper the treatment of AH. The hepatic extracellular matrix (ECM) responds dynamically to organ injury and ECM turnover increases; we propose to take advantage of this to develop new biomarkers for AH. The peptidome, low molecular weight peptides in biologic fluids, includes not only synthesized peptides, but fragments of degraded proteins (i.e., ‘degradome’). We hypothesize that the ECM degradome in plasma will yield new biomarkers to predict outcome and mechanisms in AH. We will test this hypothesis via the following Specific Aims: 1). To identify key changes in the peptidome as predictive biomarkers of outcome in AH. Unbiased peptidomics and multivariate analyses will identify degradomic features independently linked to prognosis. Protease activity that could produce significantly changed peptides will be predicted using Proteasix. We will also determine the mechanistic role of ECM turnover in the in parallel established models of alcohol-induced liver injury. 2) To develop probabilistic graphical models to predict outcome in AH. Whereas we expect the results of Aim 1 to establish that the peptidome profile in patients correlates with overall outcome, biomarkers alone are often insufficient to accurately predict individual patient outcome. We will therefore employ machine learning methods like probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) over mixed data types to integrate peptidomic and individual patient clinical data, into a single probabilistic graphical framework. The resulting graphs will then be used to infer causal interactions between variables, select informative biomarkers that will more specifically predict the outcome, and gain new mechanistic insight into the biology of AH (hypothesis generation). 3) To validate the use of the peptidome as a predictive tool for determining outcome in AH. Using a large prospectively-designed patient cohort with established outcomes, we will test the ability of the algorithms and biomarkers generated in this study to predict outcome. The successful completion of the proposed work will produce significant results at various levels: (1) Biomarker discovery: we will identify biomarkers and conditional biomarkers for AH prognosis. (2) Mechanistic understanding of AH: our models will generate hypotheses about the interactions between variables at different scales (molecular, individual) that will provide insights on the proteins that are involved in AH. (3) Algorithm development: through this project we will extend our mixed data graph learning algorithms to include censored variables (i.e., survival data). As a result of the above, this project is likely to yield novel diagnostic tools for AH that may also translate to other liver diseases. Narrative Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe acute form of alcoholic liver disease with a very high mortality rate. Despite years of research, the standard-of-care and mortality rate has not changed dramatically in over 50 years. Our goal is to develop new computational and experimental methods and discover new biomarkers for AH outcome that can efficiently identify at-risk individuals. A second goal of the project is to identify molecular mechanisms of AH, which could be targeted therapeutically.",Biomarkers of Alcoholic Hepatitis,10170180,R01AA028436,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Alcoholic Hepatitis', 'Alcoholic Liver Diseases', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Clinical Data', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Hepatic', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Matrix Metalloproteinases', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Weight', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptide Fragments', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Peptides', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Production', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Protein Fragment', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supportive care', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Work', 'acute liver injury', 'algorithm development', 'biomarker discovery', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'cohort', 'design', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'minimally invasive', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'organ injury', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'standard of care', 'targeted treatment', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,600979
"Ultrasonic Imaging of Bone Graft Healing in Extraction Sockets for Precise and Personalized Implant Therapy Abstract Socket augmentation after tooth extraction by placing either allograft or xenograft bone particulates in the socket is frequently applied to reduce jawbone volume shrinkage for subsequent implant placement. Socket healing after the augmentation varies largely, ranging from uneventful healing to infection, failure of bone graft integration and severe bone loss due to bacterial infection and/or local/systemic conditions. The healing duration, which dictates the timing of implant placement, is widely different as well. Currently, an arbitrary waiting time of 6 months after socket augmentation is adopted, when a 2-dimensional (2D) or 3D radiograph, along with a visual examination is performed to assess hard- and soft-tissue healing to determine the readiness and strategy for the subsequent implant surgery. However, 3D radiographs are not recommended for longitudinal use to monitor socket healing due to radiation concerns. They have lower image resolution (250-500 µm), which limits their ability to evaluate bone surface healing, and inferior soft tissue contrast. A non-radiation and point-of-care method that can evaluate both hard- and soft-tissue longitudinally is much needed for a definitive, accurate, and timely diagnosis of socket healing pathologies. A high-frequency and miniature-sized intraoral ultrasound probe that can operate on an off-the-shelf scanner has been manufactured in collaboration with industry (see support letter) by our research team. Research conducted by our group demonstrated accuracy of this probe in measuring various oral and dental structures. The central hypothesis is to develop ultrasound-based imaging to characterize and grade socket healing lesions in determining the extent and severity of disease. To test this hypothesis, two aims are proposed: Aim 1. Evaluate the diagnostic value of ultrasonic images for bone grafting procedures of dental extraction sockets in a longitudinal clinical study (from -2 months to +6 months of graft placement). We will compare other imaging and clinical diagnostic tools for assessing hard- and soft tissue, anatomical and physiological status throughout the longitudinal study time-course. Aim 2. Develop an extended-view scan-mode for acquiring large field- of-view jawbone images and determine buccal (facial) to lingual tissue morphology. We will engage the manufacturer (see support letter) to modify the existing scanner for this dental specific application. Design goals will include the creation of an extended, large angle, field-of-view to visualize the buccal to lingual jaw bone surface and to create machine learning based measurement tools, including soft- and hard-tissue thickness and surface analysis. Successful execution of the proposed aims will result in an imaging-based tool for longitudinal socket augmentation evaluation that is based on soft- and hard-tissue features and will allow the care provider to choose deviation from current clinical procedures where indicated. This would be investigated subsequently in a specifically designed clinical trial. Narrative The goals of this investigation are to follow dental patients that require bone grafts before their dental implant is placed and to demonstrate the diagnostic opportunities that ultrasound adds to the current standard of clinical dental care. 3",Ultrasonic Imaging of Bone Graft Healing in Extraction Sockets for Precise and Personalized Implant Therapy,10427073,R56DE030872,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Allografting', 'Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Bone Surface', 'Bone Transplantation', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Implants', 'Dental caries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Implantation procedure', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Inferior', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Jaw', 'Lateral', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Miniaturization', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Particulate', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Tissues', 'Tooth Extraction', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Wait Time', 'base', 'bone', 'bone healing', 'bone loss', 'bone xenograft', 'care providers', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'dental structure', 'design', 'experience', 'graft failure', 'graft healing', 'healing', 'improved', 'oral care', 'point of care', 'soft tissue', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R56,2021,642438
"Identifying Person-Specific Drivers of Adolescent Depression via Idiographic Network Modeling of Active and Passive Smartphone Data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Adolescents experience escalating risk for developing clinical depression, which can lead to lifelong morbidity and mortality. The neural, physical, cognitive, and socioemotional changes that may contribute to this risk also signal an opportunity for high impact intervention. Unfortunately, psychotherapy trials demonstrate modest effects on youth depression. To improve long-term outcomes for adolescents, this study will identify person- specific drivers of adolescent depression that can guide treatment personalization. Prior research with depressed or anxious adults demonstrates the existence of such drivers—symptoms and related processes that are influential (i.e., predict change in other symptoms), modifiable, and exhibit individual differences. Personalized selection and sequencing of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) modules to target these drivers early in adults have produced larger treatment effects compared to a historical benchmark. Identifying person- specific drivers during adolescence could inform treatments that account for both developmental and individual differences to shift the trajectory of depression onset and maintenance. Investigating person-specific drivers usually involves intensive surveying of self-reported experience via smartphone-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Emerging evidence suggests that smartphones can also monitor mood through passive sensing of depression-related behaviors with minimal response burden. However, nearly all such studies have been conducted with adults, despite near universal smartphone ownership among adolescents in the US. Thus, this study will leverage depressed adolescents' everyday smartphone use to assess the validity of mobile sensing against established ambulatory methods (i.e., EMA and actigraphy) to identify person-specific drivers of adolescent depression. Fifty adolescents (12–18 years old) with elevated depressive symptoms will participate in 30 days of: a) smartphone-based EMA of depressive symptoms, processes, and affect (4x/day), sleep diary (1x/day); (b) mobile sensing of mobility, physical activity, sleep, natural language use in typed interpersonal communication, screen-on time and call frequency/duration; and (c) wrist actigraphy of physical activity and sleep. Adolescents and caregivers will complete diagnostic interviews and other measures (e.g., developmental, clinical, Research Domain Criteria) at baseline, as well as user feedback interviews at follow- up. To address study aims: 1) idiographic, within-subject networks of EMA symptoms will be modeled to identify each adolescent's drivers; 2) correlations among EMA, mobile sensor, and actigraph measures of sleep, physical, and social activity; and machine learning prediction of core depressive symptoms (self- reported mood and anhedonia) will be used to assess the validity of mobile sensing for identifying person- specific drivers; 3) between-subject baseline characteristics will be explored as predictors of person-specific drivers. These results will inform future development of a scalable, low-burden smartphone-based tool that can guide personalized treatment decisions for depressed adolescents, with potential public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescence is marked by escalating risk for developing clinical depression, but also presents an optimal window for high impact intervention to alter the course of this often disabling disorder. To inform future efforts to personalize psychological interventions for depressed adolescents and maximize their efficacy, the proposed study will identify person-specific drivers of adolescent depression—influential and modifiable symptoms and processes that exhibit individual differences—and demonstrate the validity of using a smartphone tool to identify these person-specific drivers. The proposed study will generate data to inform the development of a scalable, low-burden, smartphone-based tool to guide treatment decisions, with potential public health impact given near-universal smartphone ownership among adolescents across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups in the US.",Identifying Person-Specific Drivers of Adolescent Depression via Idiographic Network Modeling of Active and Passive Smartphone Data,10196290,R21MH126394,"['18 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anhedonia', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Caregivers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Influentials', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Irritable Mood', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Personal Communication', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'anxious', 'base', 'child depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'diaries', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'network models', 'novel', 'personalized decision', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'racial and ethnic', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'tool', 'treatment effect']",NIMH,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,198257
"Flexible Piezoelectric Array for Cardiovascular MonitoringDuring Cardiac Arrest Project Summary In situations of out of hospital cardiac arrest, it is critical to quickly detect the performance of adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) through clinically acceptable pulse rate and blood pressure (BP). However, the detection of adequate CPR can be difficult for someone not trained in first aid. Currently the standard for measuring BP noninvasively is using cuff-based oscillometeric approaches. Attempts at developing these into wearable devices for automated and continuous measurements have proven difficult and so researchers have looked at other methods. However, these methods have not met the criteria for flexibility, accuracy, and low power consumption. This project aims to develop a flexible patch for accurate detection of pulse rate and blood pressure superficially through the radial, brachial, carotid, and/or femoral arteries. Piezoelectric polymers, are inherently flexible and have been used in many applications for pressure sensing, offering great potential for use as a patch-like sensor for monitoring of cardiovascular function. However, in the standard form, the material is not sensitive enough to accurately detect blood pressure. In our lab we have developed a core-shell nanofiber structure of conductive and piezoelectric nanofibers, respectively. The core-shell nanostructure shows a 4.5 times improvement in pressure sensitivity when compared to standard piezoelectric nanofibers and a nearly 40 times improvement when compared to piezoelectric polymer thin films. This improvement in pressure sensitivity should allow for a wearable device composed of these materials to exceed the necessary 35 dB signal to noise ratio required for the accurate detection of pulse wave velocity, a cardiovascular parameter used to determine blood pressure. Coupled with inkjet printing patterning techniques of conductive polymers developed in our lab, we propose to fabricate a novel core-shell nanofiber piezoelectric array in a wearable patch form for cardiovascular monitoring. In order to test this piezoelectric array and develop data-driven algorithms for the detection of blood pressure, testing will occur on a controllable simulated cardiovascular system capable of replicating a human’s diastolic and systolic blood pressures, pulse rates, and arterial mechanical properties. The blood pressure attainable by the simulated system falls within the AAMI standard benchmark for accuracy and precision for noninvasive blood pressure monitoring of 5 ± 8 mmHg. We will train various regression models using the data generated from this system to relate the detected pulse wave velocities to blood pressure and we will compare the outcomes to commonly used correlation equations. We propose that the fabrication methods we will develop, when coupled together with data-driven algorithms, will allow for the development of a low- power, flexible patch, capable of detecting pulse rate and blood pressure, giving feedback on the adequacy of CPR. Project Narrative This project plans to develop a patch-like sensor for detecting cardiovascular signals including pulse rate and blood pressure for situations of out of hospital cardiac arrest. The proposed research couples a novel core-shell piezoelectric nanostructure with an inkjet printing method for fabricating flexible arrays, to create a new class of wearable patch-like sensors for cardiovascular monitoring. Testing these sensors on a controllable simulated cardiovascular system, will allow for the development of data-driven algorithms to improve the accuracy of these devices, leading to highly accurate, patch-like cardiovascular sensing.",Flexible Piezoelectric Array for Cardiovascular MonitoringDuring Cardiac Arrest,10288237,R21EB032056,"['Algorithms', 'Arteries', 'Benchmarking', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Carotid Arteries', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Couples', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrodes', 'Equation', 'Feedback', 'Film', 'First Aid', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Heart Arrest', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Ink', 'Liquid substance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nanostructures', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Polymers', 'Printing', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Pulse Rates', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structure', 'Sulfur', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'brachial artery', 'detection method', 'falls', 'femoral artery', 'first responder', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'improved', 'mechanical properties', 'nanofiber', 'novel', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'polyvinylidene fluoride', 'pressure', 'pressure sensor', 'pulse pressure wave', 'radial artery', 'random forest', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R21,2021,232061
"Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort Project summary Our long-term goal is to demonstrate the utility of ultrasound for OA assessment, standardize its acquisition and scoring, and promote increased uptake of US for use in clinical, research, and trial settings. Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is highly prevalent and frequently debilitating. Development of potential treatments has been hampered by the heterogenous nature of this common chronic condition, which is characterized by a number of subgroups, or phenotypes, with different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Imaging, genetics, biochemical biomarkers, and other features can be used to characterize phenotypes, but variations in data types can make it difficult to harmonize definitions. While radiography is widely used in KOA imaging, it is limited in its ability to assess early disease (when interventions are most likely to succeed) and is insensitive to change. Ultrasound (US) is a widely accessible, time-efficient and cost-effective imaging modality that can provide detailed and reliable information about all joint tissues (e.g., cartilage, meniscus, synovium, bone), and could therefore inform phenotypes in KOA (e.g., by presence of synovitis, effusion, cartilage damage, calcium crystal deposition, and popliteal cysts). Use of US is currently limited by the lack of systematically performed studies in well-characterized non-clinical populations. To address this gap and further the use of this advantageous imaging modality for KOA, we will obtain standardized US and radiography in the population- based Johnston County Health Study (JoCoHS), the new enrollment phase of the 25+ year Johnston County OA Project which includes white, African American, and Hispanic men and women aged 35-70, to achieve three aims. In Aim 1, we will determine the population prevalence (n~3000) of knee US features including cartilage and meniscal damage, synovitis/effusion, calcium crystal deposition, popliteal cysts and osteophytes overall and in key subgroups by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and symptom status. Aim 2 will allow quantification of the associations between these US features and radiographic findings and symptom scores overall and in key subgroups (e.g., those with and without radiographic KOA, by sex, by race/ethnicity). For Aim 3, we will apply novel machine learning methodologies (e.g., Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, Joint and Individual Variation [JIVE], and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]) to a) develop an overall US score for symptomatic KOA and b) identify the contribution of US variables to phenotypes relevant to KOA based on general health, physical activity, and functional assessments. This study is a crucial step to establish the foundation for US as an assessment tool for clinical use, research, and clinical trials in KOA, providing unique population-based cross-sectional data regarding the utility of US and forming the basis for future longitudinal work evaluating its value and performance characteristics related to incident and progressive KOA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem that, like many other chronic conditions, is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. Ultrasound is an accessible, time-efficient, and cost-effective imaging modality that provides invaluable data about all joint tissues involved in osteoarthritis and has the potential to identify important phenotypes. The proposed work is relevant to the NIAMS mission and represents a crucial step to establish the foundation for ultrasound as an assessment tool for use in clinics, research, and clinical trials in osteoarthritis.",Assessment of ultrasound features of knee osteoarthritis in a population-based community cohort,10158441,R01AR077060,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Spur', 'Calcium', 'Cartilage', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Claustrophobias', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Assessment Tool', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'County', 'Crystal Formation', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Musculoskeletal', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Popliteal Cyst', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Differences', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Synovitis', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effusion', 'follow-up', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'interest', 'men', 'novel', 'point of care', 'population based', 'recruit', 'rheumatologist', 'sex', 'uptake']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,331837
"Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY The diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a heritable disorder characterized by periods of depression and mania, is extremely challenging in clinical practice and takes on average 5-10 years. One of the main reasons for this delay is that the majority of patients first manifest depressive symptoms (depression-first BPD), often resulting in misdiagnosis with major depressive disorder (MDD). Misdiagnosis can lead to poor clinical outcomes, increased burden for patients and high healthcare costs. The goal of this proposal is to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that distinguish depression-first BPD from MDD, in order to accelerate BPD diagnosis. During the mentored phase (K99) of the award, the PI will perform a genome wide association study to characterize the genetic architecture of differences between depression-first BPD and MDD, using available data from the collaborative Psychiatrics Genetics Consortium (Aim 1a). In a Dutch BPD cohort (n=1,750 cases) she will use machine learning methods to identify molecular, neuro-cognitive and behavioral profiles to classify depression-first BPD versus mania-first BPD (BPD with first onset of mania) and identify causal relations among predictive features (Aim 1b). During the independent phase (R00) of the award, the PI will study BPD diagnosis in a genotyped and extensively phenotyped Colombian cohort of ~5,000 cases with severe mood disorders, for which high quality electronic health records (EHR) have been collected since 2005. She will i) predict if and when patients will switch from MDD to BPD diagnosis, ii) distinguish BPD from matched MDD patients, and iii) classify BPD patients into depression-first and mania-first categories (Aims 2 and 3). She will estimate heritability of identified signatures and integrate results from both Dutch and Colombian cohorts. Building upon her expertise in complex trait genetics and method development, this award will allow the PI to extend her knowledge-base of clinical phenotyping in psychiatry; grow her expertise in statistical modeling; and strengthen her communication, mentoring, and leadership skills to prepare for a successful career as an independent researcher. The PI will complete the K99 phase of the award at UCLA, which fosters an ideal training environment. The strong advisory committee with Drs. Freimer, Ophoff, and Eskin (UCLA) and Dr. Sabatti (Stanford) will facilitate her scientific and personal development and promote her long-term career goal of tackling clinically relevant problems in psychiatric illness through the study of genetic, neuro-cognitive and behavioral mechanisms. The PI will first focus on the diagnosis of BPD, and then expand, in the future, into other psychiatric trait-mechanisms, such as disease severity and drug response. This award will be fundamental in support of her career goals. Successful completion of the specific aims of this proposal is likely to significantly improve the time to BPD diagnosis, and thereby reduce the burden of this debilitating disorder for patients and society. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Because the majority of patients with bipolar disorder initially manifest depressive symptoms and are misdiagnosed with major depressive disorder, they often receive several years of sub-optimal treatment and experience poor clinical outcomes, until they obtain the correct diagnosis. I aim to identify genetic and phenotypic signatures that predict which patients diagnosed with depression are likely to develop bipolar disorder, which may accelerate diagnosis and reduce the burden of this disorder on patients and society.",Accelerating the Diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder Using Genetic and Phenotypic Signatures,10140420,R00MH116115,"['Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Categories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Colombian', 'Communication', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heritability', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Psychiatry', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling Studies', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'genetic architecture', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'method development', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'optimal treatments', 'phenotypic data', 'polygenic risk score', 'predictive signature', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'suicidal morbidity', 'trait']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R00,2021,248878
"COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device Recent studies, including ours, have suggested that breath may allow us to diagnose COVID-19 infection and even monitor its progress. As compared to immunological and genetic based methods using sample media like blood, nasopharyngeal swab, and saliva, breath analysis is non-invasive, simple, safe, and inexpensive; it allows a nearly infinite amount of sample volume and can be used at the point-of-care for rapid detection. Fundamentally, breath also provides critical metabolomics information regarding how human body responds to virus infection and medical intervention (such as drug treatment and mechanical ventilation). The objectives of the proposed SCENT project are: (1) to refine automated, portable, high-performance micro-gas chromatography (GC) device and related data analysis / biomarker identification algorithms for rapid (5-6 minutes), in-situ, and sensitive (down to ppt) breath analysis and (2) to conduct breath analysis on up to 760 patients, and identify and validate the COVID-19 biomarkers in breath. Thus, in coordination with the RADx-rad Data Coordination Center (DCC), we will complete the following specific aims. (1) Refine 5 automated micro-GC devices to achieve higher speed and better separation capability. We will construct 5 new automated and portable one-dimensional micro-GC devices that require only ~6 minutes of assay time (improved from current 20 minutes) at the ppt level sensitivity (Sub-Aim 1a). Then the devices will be upgraded to 2-dimensional micro-GC to significantly increase the separation capability (Sub-Aim 1b). In the meantime, we will optimize and automate our existing data processing and biomarker identification algorithms and codes to streamline the workflow so that the GC device can automatically process and analyze the data without human intervention (Sub-Aim 1c). (2) Identify breath biomarkers that distinguish COVID-19 positive (symptomatic and asymptomatic) and negative patients. We will recruit a training cohort of 380 participants, including 190 COVID-19 positive patients (95 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic) and 190 COVID-19 negative patients from two hospitals (Michigan Medicine – Ann Arbor and the Henry Ford Hospital – Detroit). We will conduct breath analysis using machine learning to identify VOC patterns that match each COVID-19 diagnostic status. (3) Validate the COVID-19 biomarkers using our refined micro-GC devices. Using the refined 2-D micro-GC devices from Sub-Aim 1b, we will recruit a new validation cohort of 380 participants (190 COVID-19 positive patients and 190 COVID-19 negative patients) to validate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2.  We will leverage existing engineering, data science, clinical, regulatory, and commercialization resources throughout the project to hit our milestones, ensuring a high likelihood of rapid patient impact. Upon completion of this work, we will have a portable micro-GC device and accompanying automated algorithms that can detect and monitor COVID-19 status for people in a variety of clinical and community settings. Narrative  Our team of engineers, clinicians, and data scientists has developed a portable, high performance breath analyzer that can be used to detect certain diseases. In this project, we will adapt and refine our existing device and algorithms so they can be used for rapid, safe, and non- invasive COVID-19 detection. People will simply breath into the device and it will quickly provide results, meaning that it can be used in a variety of everyday settings to help fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",COVID-19 detection through scent analysis with a compact GC device,10266206,U18TR003812,"['Acute', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biotechnology', 'Blood', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 detection', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 monitoring', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Immunologics', 'In Situ', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Monitor', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Process', 'Production', 'RADx Radical', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'fight against', 'fighting', 'global health', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'nasopharyngeal swab', 'outcome forecast', 'pandemic disease', 'point of care', 'portability', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'respiratory hypoxia', 'screening', 'severe COVID-19', 'two-dimensional']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U18,2021,999775
"An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this project is to create an unobtrusive, wrist-worn, cuff-less blood pressure monitor for measurement and identification of nocturnal nondipping hypertension. The investigation includes extensive validation with state-of-the-art ambulatory blood pressure monitors at nighttime in presence of heterogeneous treatment paradigms. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one of the major causes of ailments worldwide. Hypertension alone affects one in three adults according to the World Health Organization. Therefore, monitoring blood pressure has become a critical part of healthcare as it is known to be linked to many CVDs. Traditionally, clinical practitioners have relied on the mercury-based (or digital equivalent) inflatable cuff-based sphygmomanometer. However, the nature of the device allows for only infrequent measurements and its somewhat invasive nature and associated discomfort prohibits additional nocturnal measurements. There is certainly a value to measuring blood pressure continuously in the natural context of the user’s environment, in particular during sleep, without being disturbed by the instrument. Our proposed technology can provide a wealth of information to physicians, help identify certain short-term dynamics/variations of blood pressure, and allow effective monitoring of response to medication, among other things. Nocturnal measurements provide additional prognostic value in identifying risk. Despite these benefits, no wearable, non-invasive device for continuous blood pressure monitoring exists on the market simply because none have been reliable enough to be considered clinical grade. This project aims to develop a robust and reliable blood pressure monitor in the form of a wrist-worn device that uses bio-impedance sensors, and for the first time, demonstrate clinical grade reliability. These sensors measure pulse wave velocity (PWV) along with several other derivatives for cardiovascular parameters including heart rate and blood volume changes in arteries, which correlate with the blood pressure. The system will incorporate clever hardware design to localize underlying vasculature and focus on arterial sites for enhanced accuracy. The device will include a motion sensor to take into account the user’s movements and motion artifacts, the contact quality, and reliability of the measurements. Advanced machine learning techniques, leveraging both general and personalized models, will be developed to convert bio-impedance measurements to blood pressure. This project aims to then validate the system and analytics in both a healthy patient cohort and a hypertensive cohort, learning the impact that nocturnal ‘nondipping’ hypertension and anti-hypertensive treatments have on PWV/other cardiovascular correlates and blood pressure estimates. After decades of relying on the inflatable cuff- based technique, this system could represent a significant change in how we measure blood pressure. PROJECT NARRATIVE Continuous monitoring of nocturnal blood pressure can help early diagnosis of developing cardiac conditions, reveal short term blood pressure variations, and also help the physician monitor differences in variations in response to medication for hypertensive patients. Moreover, the comfort and convenience of a wearable monitor would allow measurement in the natural context of daily life, including important nocturnal measurements, and reduce the burden of adherence on the user. The system will also provide feedback on quality of measurements to allow the users or care-givers to gauge reliability.",An Unobtrusive Continuous Cuff-less Blood Pressure Monitor for Nocturnal Hypertension,10166912,R01HL151240,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arteries', 'Awareness', 'Biometry', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood flow', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'FDA approved', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Legal patent', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Methods', 'Microfabrication', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proxy', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sphygmomanometers', 'Structural Models', 'Supine Position', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Wrist', 'advanced analytics', 'analytical method', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'effectiveness validation', 'electric impedance', 'insight', 'instrument', 'model development', 'monitoring device', 'motion sensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'performance tests', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep position', 'supine sleep', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'willingness']",NHLBI,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R01,2021,678001
"The Gut Microbiome Brain Axis and Preterm Infants PROJECT SUMMARY  Infancy is increasingly being recognized as a key time point of microbiome establishment that impacts neonatal health as well as later outcomes. The intestinal microbiome has specifically been implicated in neurologic outcomes via the gut-brain axis. However, means by which the intestinal microbiome can have influence on the brain are poorly understood. The preterm infant is at the nexus of these unknowns. Preterm infants are a vulnerable patient population at risk for significant poor long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Preterm infant brain development occurs in parallel with intestinal microbiome development, thus modification of the intestinal microbiome is a potential means of improving neurodevelopmental outcomes. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that distinct gut microbiome taxa and metabolites at key time points improve preterm infant neurodevelopmental outcomes at school age.  Our preliminary and published data in gnotobiotic mouse models demonstrates that different early preterm infant microbiota impact neuron number, myelination, and behavior. This proposal will use our ongoing MIND (Microbiome In Neonatal Development) preterm infant cohort to determine how the gut microbiome impacts neurodevelopmental potential in the NICU, and how it may alter neurodevelopmental trajectories post- NICU discharge. We will conduct longitudinal sampling of participant fecal and blood samples to monitor gut microbiome as well as fecal and serum metabolites. We will also perform neurodevelopmental testing during the NICU course and up until preschool/school age (3.5-5 years old). School readiness, which describes children's strengths, challenges, and needs for supports when learning in the classroom, is a functional outcome that differs from single summary measures of intelligence (IQ) and will be the outcome measure.  A combination of 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics and metabonomics will be applied to the collected fecal samples. Sophisticated machine learning strategies will be used to develop novel models of preterm infant gut microbiome succession with time as a critical element. Serum cytokine analysis and metabonomics will provide mechanistic insight into how the gut microbiome may be impacting neurodevelopment. We have established complementary in vivo gnotobiotic mouse models, in which germ-free mice are transfaunated with preterm infant microbiota. This state-of-the-art experimental model will allow specific investigation of the impact of clinically relevant microbiota on brain development that is not possible in human infants. The goal of this proposal is to discover intestinal microbiome patterns associated with school readiness, identify the key time points that represent windows of opportunity for microbiome optimization, and identify mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiome impacts brain development and behavior. This new knowledge will enhance our understanding of the gut-brain axis and lay the foundation for microbial based therapeutics to improve infant neurodevelopmental trajectories. PROJECT NARRATIVE The intestinal microbiome has impact beyond the gut and the existence of a gut-brain axis has been proposed. Preterm infants are at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. This proposal will study how the changes in bacterial colonization patterns of preterm infants over time from birth until school age impact brain development, and thus school readiness and learning for these vulnerable infants.",The Gut Microbiome Brain Axis and Preterm Infants,10200392,R01HD105234,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', '5 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Enrollment', 'Experimental Models', 'Foundations', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genes', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head circumference', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Neonatal', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurons', 'Nursery Schools', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Premature Infant', 'Publishing', 'Readiness', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Serum', 'Shotguns', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior test', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'fecal microbiota', 'functional outcomes', 'gut microbiome', 'gut-brain axis', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'insight', 'intestinal barrier', 'learning strategy', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'myelination', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prospective', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapy design']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,705079
"Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. Barrett’s esophagus (BE) confers elevated risk for progression to EAC. Patients diagnosed with BE undergo periodic surveillance endoscopy with biopsies to detect dysplasia which can be treated by endoscopic eradication with radiofrequency ablation before it progresses to EAC. However, the majority of diagnosed EAC patients have not had prior screening endoscopy and present with advanced lesions that limit treatment options and result in poorer survival. The development of a rapid, low cost, well tolerated, non-endoscopic BE screening technique that can be performed in unsedated patients at points of care outside the endoscopy suite would improve BE detection and reduce EAC morbidity and mortality. Our program is a multidisciplinary collaboration among investigators at the Massachusetts Institute Technology and Veteran Affairs Boston Healthcare System / Harvard Medical School that integrates novel optical imaging and software design, preclinical studies in swine, clinical studies in patients, and advanced image processing / machine learning. Aim 1 will develop an omniview tethered capsule technology that generates a map of the esophageal mucosa over a multi-centimeter length of esophagus and a series of wide angle forward views to aid navigation as the capsule is swallowed or retracted. The images will resemble endoscopic white light or narrow band imaging, but will not suffer from perspective distortion present in standard endoscopic or video capsule images. This will facilitate development of automated BE detection algorithms as well as enhance their sensitivity and specificity. This aim will also perform imaging studies in swine as a translational step toward clinical studies. Aim 2 will determine reader sensitivity and specificity for BE detection versus standard endoscopy / biopsy and prepare data for developing automated BE detection. Patients undergoing screening as well as with history of BE undergoing surveillance will be recruited and unsedated capsule imaging will be performed on the same day prior to their endoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity for detecting BE will be assessed using multiple blinded readers and data sets suitable for developing automated BE detection algorithms will be developed. Aim 3 will develop image analysis methods for automated BE detection by investigating classifiers that operate on handcrafted features (colors and textures) and modern deep convolutional neural network methods for direct classification. If successful, this program will develop a rapid, low cost and scalable method for BE screening that would not require patient sedation, endoscopy, or tissue acquisition, and which could be performed in community primary care clinics. The procedure would be much faster and many times lower cost than endoscopy. Automated BE detection would enable immediate results for patient consultation and referral to gastroenterology if indicated. Larger patient populations with expanded risk criteria could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing EAC mortality. Esophageal adenocarcinoma is among the most lethal malignancies with a 19% five-year survival rate and its incidence has increased several fold in the last decades. The program proposes to develop an omniview tethered capsule technology, examination protocol, and automated analysis methods for low cost, rapid, well tolerated, and scalable screening in order to facilitate monitoring and timely treatment. Larger patient populations could be cost effectively screened and access to screening dramatically improved, reducing mortality.","Omniview tethered capsule for low cost, non-endoscopic Barrett's esophagus screening in unsedated patients",10210371,R01CA252216,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Back', 'Barrett Esophagus', 'Biopsy', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Boston', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dysplasia', 'Endoscopic Biopsy', 'Endoscopy', 'Esophageal Adenocarcinoma', 'Esophageal mucous membrane', 'Esophagus', 'Family suidae', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Gastroesophageal reflux disease', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Institutes', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Label', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Population', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiofrequency Interstitial Ablation', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Referral and Consultation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Screening Result', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Side', 'Software Design', 'Stomach', 'Surface', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Validation', 'advanced disease', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'capsule', 'clinical imaging', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'image processing', 'imaging software', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'navigation aid', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'preclinical study', 'programs', 'recruit', 'screening']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,345509
"Predicting Outcomes in Children with Ulcerative Colitis Summary/Abstract Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic intestinal disorder, a type of inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD). UC causes abdominal pain, diarrhea, bleeding and weight loss. Each year there are about 38,000 new UC cases with about 25-30% being children. UC is often more severe in children than adults. There is no standard regimen for managing all people with UC. Treatment of UC includes 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics and surgery to remove the colon. Ideally a personalized medicine approach should be taken to tailor therapy to the individual patient based on their disease severity and predicted response. However, there is currently a lack of guidance to clinicians as to which children are going to do well with these medications and who needs more medication exposure or surgery. To address this important issue, a clinical trial of standardized medical therapy was launched enrolling 428 children newly diagnosed with UC at 29 pediatric medical centers in North America (Predicting Response to Standardized Pediatric Colitis Therapy: The PROTECT Study). The PROTECT study collected clinical, genetic, environment and immune factors along with biospecimens including blood, stool, and colonic tissue. It was anticipated that a combination of clinical, genetic, and immunologic tests performed at diagnosis can construct a valuable predictive model for personalized medicine which can be implemented to improve clinical outcomes such as early and late remission on 5-ASA only without the concurrent use of steroid medications. Along this line, state-of-art machine learning algorithms can ultimately utilize the PROTECT study data and more accurately predict clinical outcomes. The ability to develop accurate predictive models using basic clinical, endoscopic, histologic, and laboratory data would be extremely helpful to clinicians, as well as to patients/families in helping them better understand the decision making process. ML-based models will be validated with external electronic health records data. Further, there is a lack of easy- to-use clinical decision support tool to help clinicians make decisions in the ﬁeld. This study will ﬁll the gap. Project Narrative The proposed project will accurately predict early and late clinical outcomes of patients following initial standard therapy in children with ulcerative colitis.

"Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients Severe trauma injury renders patients vulnerable to infections and subsequent risk of infections-related outcomes, including multiple organ failure/dysfunction syndrome (MOF/MODS), a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Although it is well-established that infection is a major risk factor for MOF, not all patients who experience nosocomial infections develop MOF, highlighting the importance of considering the underlying molecular biological mechanisms of heterogeneity in susceptibility to MOF development after infections (ie. infections-related MOF). In current clinical practices, MOF-specific score systems based on physiological measurements such as the Denver and Marshall Scores are monitored and used to diagnose patients with MOF after its onset. Here we propose to build prediction models for infections-related MOF before its onset using molecular signatures in order to significantly increase prediction accuracy. Methods of rapid (ie. immediately after the detection of infection) and accurate identification of patients who are highly susceptible to infections- related outcomes are expected to aid in informed decision-making and ensuring appropriate delivery of preventative measures to control MOF incidence. Such methods may thus result in improved health of patients and reduced health care costs. This proposal aims to employ an unbiased computational approach to investigate genome-wide transcriptome profiles and develop a panel of biomarkers to predict infections-related MOF immediately after the detection of infection. Previous transcriptome studies in the context of infections often focus on patient responses to infection. In contrast, we propose to focus on biomarker panel development to predict a specific infections-related adverse outcome before it occurrs. Two Aims are proposed to predict the outcome of infections-related MOF among blunt trauma patients, a population that is highly susceptible to infections. Aim 1: using blood samples from the Inflammation and the Host Response to Injury Study (“Glue Grant”), we will utilize our early blood transcriptome multi-biomarker development machine learning pipeline to build models for prediction of infections-related MOF outcome among a cohort of blunt trauma patients. Aim 2: we will build prediction models using injury severity scores and other common demographic and clinical variables for infections-related MOF and compare their performance with the multi-biomarker model. We hypothesize that, in comparison to models based on clinical scores, our proposed strategy based on transcriptomic signatures will result in an increasingly accurate prediction and, furthermore, provide insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to MOF after infection. Identification of these molecular mechanisms may ultimately aid in uncovering potential targets for pharmacological interventions. Overall, results from this study may provide the foundation for further studies of infections-related outcome prediction in different blunt trauma cohorts, as well as in cohorts affected by other types of trauma. The methods and findings from this study may also be applicable to other immunocompromised populations, such as cancer patients and post-surgery patients. Severe trauma renders patients immunocompromised and vulnerable to infections that often lead to life- threatening conditions, such as multiple organ failure (MOF). Our study proposes to provide a personalized medicine strategy for rapidly and accurately identifying patients who are at high risk of developing MOF immediately after they experience infection. Early risk profiling will aid clinicians in informed decision-making to improve patient outcomes and may also lead to the development of new preventative methods.",Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients,10126230,R03AI151499,"['APACHE II', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Glossary', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive measure', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Sterility', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'new therapeutic target', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic tool', 'rapid technique', 'resilience', 'response', 'response to injury', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,84000
"Concussion and Driving Skills in the Young Driver PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Research Objectives. This prospective cohort study rigorously examines the neurocognitive impact of concussion on simulated and real-world driving performance among young drivers aged 16-24 years. Importance. Concussion impairs cognitive processing speed, attention, concentration and integration – skills which are also important for safe driving. Unlike new “Return to Learn” guidelines, there are no evidence-based “Return to Drive” guidelines for when individuals with concussion may be safe to return to driving. Objectives. Conduct a prospective matched cohort study to explore the risk of concussion in simulated and real-world driving conditions. We propose three specific aims and a fourth exploratory aim:  (i) Examine whether concussion negatively impacts simulated driving performance among young  drivers, relative to a cohort of young drivers without concussion.  (ii) Determine whether simulated driving task performance correlates with recovery from  concussion symptoms and signs in the month following concussion, relative to young drivers  without recent concussion.  (iii) Measure the impact of concussion and recovery on real-world driving exposure and performance.  (iv) [Exploratory] Examine whether concussion symptoms and neuropsychometric impairment are  associated with higher rates of driving citations or reported crashes. Study design. Prospective controlled matched cohort study. Setting/participants. 50 drivers with recent concussion; 50 age/gender matched controls aged 16-25 years. Study protocol. Concussion participants will be recruited within two weeks of concussion. Case and control participants will complete 1) driving risk survey; 2) neuropsychological testing an 3) simulated driving tasks at baseline and 1 month. Commercially available monitoring technology will record risky driving for 3 months Outcome measures. (i) simulated driving risk scores; (ii) real world driving risk scores (rapid braking, rapid acceleration, speeding); (iii) reported citations and crash rates. Impact. This study will have a significant population health impact in elucidating the neurocognitive sequelae of recent concussion on driving. Results will inform return to safe driving among young drivers with concussion.

Chu, PhD, MS is a biostatistician and molecular epidemiologist with strong and substantial commitments to integrative omic research in respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. Her career objective is to become an independent investigator with expertise in developing and applying novel statistical methods and multiomic network approaches that facilitate mechanistic understanding of the intersection of respiratory and neurodevelopmental disease. This proposal combines Dr. Chu’s extensive training in integrative omic methods development, along with her experience in genetic and metabolomic research, to examine the integrative metabolomic etiology of asthma and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder overlap (AAO). A wealth of epidemiological literature has revealed with remarkable consistency that asthmatic patients are at greater risk for ADHD, and vice versa, with a number of longitudinal studies of childhood asthma indicating excess risk of ADHD in adolescence and adulthood. However, no studies have directly interrogated the biological mechanisms by which these conditions may be related. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that childhood asthma and ADHD share both common and distinct dysregulated metabolic processes, some of which may have drivers that are genetic in origin. This will be explored using existing genetic and metabolomic data from the Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP), the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART), and the Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood 2010 (COPSAC), three large prospective cohorts of children with extensive longitudinal phenotyping and multiple omic data types, by identifying metabolites and metabolic profiles associated with AAO (aim 1), constructing multiomic models and features that characterize dysregulated metabolic processes and their upstream drivers in AAO (aim 2), and validation and replication of all findings (aim 3). As Dr. Chu completes these aims, her career development program will facilitate the achievement of her primary training goals: 1) increase clinical understanding of ADHD and asthma diagnosis and treatment; 2) gain a nuanced understanding of best methods for, and practical experience in, the biological and statistical integration of genetic and metabolomic data; 3) develop skills in machine learning and integrative network methods for multiomic analysis; 4) strengthen current areas of experience to stay on the cutting edge of new analytic and study design techniques; and 5) enhance skills in mentorship, teaching, and the responsible conduct and communication of research. The support of a diverse mentoring team comprised of world experts in the fields of asthma and psychiatric genetics, metabolomics, integrative omics, and statistics, along with her strong quantitative training and the vibrant intellectual community of Harvard Medical School and the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, ensure the success of this proposal. Finally, this research will use state-of-the-art multiomic techniques to lay the initial groundwork for understanding the pathobiology of asthma and ADHD comorbidity, a major and well-established public health concern, from which new research programs will emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although a rich epidemiological literature has demonstrated a high comorbidity between asthma, the most common respiratory disease worldwide, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), the most common behavioral disorder among children, with reports of significant increases in diagnoses in recent years, no studies have interrogated the potential molecular pathobiology underlying the mutual excess risk between asthma and ADHD. This proposal aims to use integrative techniques by combining genetic and metabolomic data to characterize common and distinct mechanisms and pathways of dysregulated metabolism in the presence of comorbid asthma and ADHD and to develop multiomic profiles which can assist in predicting higher risk of ADHD among asthmatic children. The findings from this study will be instrumental in understanding the molecular underpinnings of two highly prevalent public health concerns, and this study will be the first of its kind to interrogate the molecular intersections between asthma and ADHD.",Integrative metabolomic characterization of ADHD and asthma comorbidity,10224338,K01HL153941,"['Achievement', 'Adolescence', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Awareness', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Asthma', 'Clinical', 'Communication Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Formulation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration Disorders', 'Risk', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Sphingolipids', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tryptophan', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Woman', 'antenatal', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'biological systems', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolomics', 'method development', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychogenetics', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'screening', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,178200
"1/2 Leveraging electronic health records for pharmacogenomics of psychiatric disorders Schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are highly heritable, debilitating diseases with lifetime prevalences of ~1% and 15%, respectively. Both disorders carry substantial morbidity and mortality and are associated with severe societal and personal costs. Despite the availability of efficacious treatments for both disorders, ~1/3 of individuals will not achieve symptomatic improvement even after multiple rounds of medication. Identifying individuals at greater risk for such treatment nonresponse, or treatment resistance, could facilitate more targeted interventions for these individuals.  A burgeoning literature has identified genomic variation associated with treatment response. IN particular, antidepressant response has been suggested to be highly heritable; convergent data from rodent studies likewise suggest that antipsychotic and antidepressant response phenotypes are influenced by genetic variation. However, treatment studies to date have had minimal success in identifying variants associated with psychotropic response, likely as a result of limited sample sizes: prior efforts required sequential treatment trials and prospective assessment to characterize outcomes. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) data provide an opportunity to efficiently characterize treatment response in many individuals in real-world settings. Coupled with large and expanding biobanks, these cohorts allow for low- cost, large-scale genomic studies that finally achieve sufficient power to detect realistic effect sizes.  The investigators now propose to apply these approaches to the EHRs of two large regional health systems, each linked to a large biobank, to investigate treatment resistance in SCZ and MDD. They will apply canonical indicators of treatment resistance - clozapine treatment for SCZ, and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for MDD - to identify coded and uncoded clinical features associated with high probability of treatment resistance in EHR data. These predictors will themselves provide a useful baseline for identifying high risk individuals. Then, they will apply these to study the entire affected population of each biobank, extending existing genomic data with additional genome-wide association, yielding more than 26,000 antidepressant-treated individuals and 2,500 antipsychotic-treated individuals. Rather than simply conducting a case-control study, they will examine treatment resistance as a quantitative trait, applying a method developed by the investigators and shown to substantially increase power for such traits.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and analysis of large scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in psychiatric treatment resistance. Spanning two distinct health systems, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next- step investigations. Successful identification of risk variants will facilitate efforts at clinical risk stratification as well as investigation of the biology underlying treatment resistance. Public Health Statement Despite the availability of effective treatments for schizophrenia and major depressive disorder, around 1/3 of individuals will not have symptomatic improvement after multiple treatment trials. If individuals at high risk for treatment resistance could be identified early, it might be possible to find more effective treatments for them.

"Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Strom received an MD from Harvard Medical School (HMS), and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (BIDMC), and non-invasive cardiac imaging (BIDMC). Additionally, he completed an MSc in Epidemiology program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in May, 2018. He is now a junior faculty member at BIDMC with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. Through this proposed 5-year program, Dr. Strom will pursue additional training in advanced prediction modeling, machine learning, patient-oriented research, and metabolomics. The candidate’s long- term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the area of applied outcomes research. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Robert W. Yeh (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, Robert E. Gerszten (Co-Mentor), Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at BIDMC, and Changyu Shen (Co-Mentor), upcoming Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Lead Biostatistician for the Smith Center. Dr. Yeh has a track record of leading practice-changing studies and successful mentorship of clinician investigators. Dr. Gerszten is an internationally recognized expert in molecular phenotyping of cardiovascular diseases using metabolomics and proteomics and has mentored several K-award and R01 funded clinical investigators. Dr. Shen has a long track record of NIH funding, expertise in evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect in cardiovascular diseases, and has mentored multiple prior trainees. Research: The optimal therapy for a given individual with aortic stenosis remains uncertain. This proposal seeks to define the clinical and biologic components of frailty that modify risk after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and alter treatment benefit. For Aims 1-2, we will leverage the unique linkage of Medicare data to the US CoreValve Pivotal trials, a collection of clinical trials that randomized individuals with severe aortic stenosis to transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis vs. surgical AVR (SAVR). In Aim 1, we will we will identify which variables, related to in-person assessments of frailty and candidate frailty codes, best predict adverse outcomes after AVR. In Aim 2, we will identify if novel variables identified in Aim 1, identify a heterogeneous treatment response in individuals undergoing AVR. In Aim 3, we will prospectively enroll patients undergoing TAVR at BIDMC with concurrent frailty phenotyping to identify whether metabolites associated with longevity correlate with frailty and predict adverse outcomes, independent of age and comorbidities. The research will identify the mechanisms by which frailty confers adverse risk and differential treatment benefit in AVR, providing insights that may personalize treatment selection and improve patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE While new technologies have permitted the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis, which is fatal without treatment, deciding on the optimal treatment for a given patient is often difficult, especially as these decisions are often made towards the end of life and there are significant risks concomitant with each treatment. In this setting, frailty, a state of debility that impairs recovery from illness, has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes but the mechanisms by which frailty confers risk and the components of frailty that are most important are unknown. In this proposal, we seek to define the clinical and biological components of frailty that contribute risk in aortic valve replacement using a combination of novel data sources and methodologic techniques, including linkage of clinical trials to administrative data, machine learning, and metabolite profiling, in order to personalize treatments and optimize patient health and medical decision making.",Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling,10217235,K23HL144907,"['Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioprosthesis device', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronology', 'Citric Acid Cycle', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Israel', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physician Executives', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve replacement', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'end of life', 'frailty', 'health data', 'health service use', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'mid-career faculty', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'surgical risk', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2021,172800
"COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has manifested in children with a wide spectrum of clinical presentations ranging from asymptomatic infection to devastating acute respiratory symptoms, appendicitis (often with rupture), and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a serious inflammatory condition presenting several weeks after exposure to or infection with the virus. These presentations overlap in their clinical severity while maintaining distinct clinical profiles. Public health and clinical approaches will benefit from an improved understanding of the spectrum of illness associated with SARS CoV-2 and from the capacity to integrate data to achieve two goals: (i) to identify the clinical, social, and biological variables that predict severe COVID-19 and MIS-C, and (ii) to target those populations and individuals at greatest risk for harm from the virus. We propose the COVID-19 Network of Networks Expanding Clinical and Translational approaches to Predict Severe Illness in Children (CONNECT to Predict SIck Children) comprising eight partners providing access to data on >15 million children. Our network will systematically integrate social, epidemiological, genetic, immunological, and computational approaches to identify both population- and individual-level risk factors for severe illness. Our underlying hypothesis is that a combination of multidimensional data – clinical, sociodemographic, epidemiologic, and biological -- can be integrated to predict which children are at greatest risk to have severe consequences from SARS-CoV-2 infection. To test our hypothesis, we will develop CONNECT to Predict SIck Children, a network of networks that leverages inpatient, outpatient, community, and epidemiological data resources to support the analysis of large data using machine learning and model-based analyses. For the R61 phase, we will develop and refine predictive models using data from our network of networks (Aim 1). We will also recruit participants previously diagnosed with either COVID-19 or MIS-C (along with appropriate controls who have had mild or asymptomatic infections with SARS-CoV2), who will provide survey data (including social determinants) and saliva and blood samples to identify persisting biological factors associated with severe disease (Aim 2). We will iteratively assess our models using a knowledge management framework that considers the marginal value of data for improving models' predictive capacity over time. In the R33 phase, we will validate and further refine predictive models incorporating data from additional participants recruited throughout our network of networks, including newly infected children with severe COVID-19 or MIS-C identified through real-time surveillance (Aim 3). We seek to develop predictive models for children and adolescents that are useful, sensitive to community and environmental contexts, and informed by the REASSURED framework specified by the RFA. The models and biomarkers developed through our nationwide network of networks will produce generalizable knowledge that will improve our ability to predict which children are at greatest risk for severe complications of SARS-CoV- 2 infection. This knowledge will facilitate interventions to prevent and treat severe pediatric illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a world-wide public health problem. Pediatric disease has been particularly difficult to manage since children tend less frequently to get sick from SARS-CoV-2 infection as adults but, when they do become ill, can present with life-threatening pulmonary disease or a systemic inflammatory condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome.

"Mitochondrial regulation of stress reactivity in humans Chronic dysregulation of physiological systems manifests systemically as allostatic load (AL) and in abnormal stress reactivity profiles, which are features of psychopathological conditions that increase future disease risk. But the biological basis underlying inter-individual differences in stress regulation and reactivity remains unknown. Even among populations of healthy individuals exposed to standardized laboratory challenges, such as the Trier social stress test (TSST), there are substantial differences in the magnitude of responses in multiple physiological systems, including but not limited to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and cardiovascular system, metabolic changes, and immune and pro-inflammatory systems. One common factor to all stress systems is their dependence on energy supply, which fuels every aspect of the stress response including molecular, cellular, systemic and cognitive/psychological functioning. At the cellular level, energy is provided by mitochondria, unique organelles that populate the cell cytoplasm and contain their own genome, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), that is essential to mitochondrial health. MtDNA defects cause dysregulation of multiple aspects of mitochondrial structure and function, known as mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL). Three main lines of evidence suggest that MAL contributes to AL and regulates stress responses in humans: i) we recently discovered that the mtDNA is released following psychological stress in humans (PNEC 2019), ii) experimentally-induced MAL in animals caused specific alterations in the multisystem physiological responses to psychological stress (PNAS 2015), and iii) mitochondria are the source of stress hormones, including cortisol that is synthesized in mitochondria within the adrenal glands (Nat Genetics 2012). Together, this evidence suggests that MAL may alter both baseline AL and stress reactivity profiles, potentially providing new insight into the source of interindividual differences in stress regulation and health in general. In this project, we perform the first comprehensive assessment of MAL, systemic AL, multisystem stress reactivity to a laboratory challenge (TSST) in three groups of individuals who have rare genetic mtDNA defects that selectively causes different forms of MAL and in a healthy control group. Multisystem stress biomarker profiling under fasting baseline and stress reactive conditions will provide a comprehensive test of pathways linking MAL to stress physiology in humans. The resulting high-dimensionality data will be treated using integrative data analytic approaches and classifying algorithms, including cross-validated machine learning models, to identify resting and stress-reactive biomarker signatures responsive to MAL. In parallel, assessments of executive function and key domains of psychosocial functioning including mood, stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and well-being will contribute to provide a comprehensive picture of novel mitochondrial psychobiological pathways. NARRATIVE There are large unexplained inter-individual differences in systemic allostatic load and stress reactivity, which may in part be explained by mitochondria. Here we study the effects of chronic dysregulation of mitochondrial function – mitochondrial allostatic load (MAL) – on multisystem stress regulation in humans.

"A Personalized, Patient-Centered Approach to Optimizing Lupus Care Candidate: April Jorge, MD is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and an Assistant in Medicine in the Rheumatology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). After graduating from the University of Maryland magna cum laude, she received her MD from Georgetown University, and she completed her internal medicine residency at Northwestern University. She completed her rheumatology fellowship at MGH, during which she also completed the Harvard Catalyst Clinical and Translational Research Academy and began working with Hyon Choi, MD, DrPH. Dr. Jorge's prior work has resulted in 15 peer- reviewed original papers, with 13 as the first author or co-first author. Her goal is to become an independent investigator and innovative leader in patient-oriented research of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Mentorship, Training Activities, and Environment: Dr. Jorge will conduct the proposed project at MGH under the mentorship of Hyon Choi, MD, DrPH and co-mentorship of Karen Costenbader, MD, MPH and Karen Sepucha, PhD. Dr. Choi is a world-renowned, NIH-funded physician scientist in advanced clinical epidemiology of rheumatic conditions, ranging from common disorders to rare but serious disorders (e.g., SLE). He has served as a mentor for several prior K awardees. Dr. Costenbader is a clinical investigator and expert in SLE who is also an experienced mentor of K awardees. Dr. Sepucha is a leading expert in patient-centered decision science. Dr. Jorge's research will also benefit from the specific expertise of her key collaborators, including advanced clinical epidemiology methods, machine learning prediction algorithms, and decision- analytic modeling. In addition to receiving excellent mentorship, she will acquire new skills through didactics in advanced clinical epidemiology and pharmacoepidemiology, risk prediction, eliciting patient preferences with a mixed methods research approach, and decision-analytic modeling. Research: SLE carries increased risks of multiple comorbidities and double the risk of death compared to the general population. Current treatment is limited in part by few proven medications and adverse treatment effects. The central goal of this research is to improve long-term SLE outcomes by integrating personalized risks of potential harms and benefits with patient preferences to guide the personalized, patient-centered use of key lupus medications. To achieve this goal, she will risk stratify patients for potential harms of treatment, i.e., hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and infection with belimumab use versus other immunosuppressants, and other adverse outcomes, i.e., severe COVID-19 infection (Aim 1). She will elicit patient preferences for SLE treatment through a discrete choice experiment (Aim 2a) and will integrate patient preferences with personalized risks through a multi-criteria decision analysis to determine the optimal hydroxychloroquine dose in SLE care (Aim 2b). Completion of this proposal and training plan will position Dr. Jorge with the vital experience to become an independent clinical investigator in patient-oriented research of SLE. Project Narrative Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous systemic condition associated with serious morbidity and premature mortality, yet treatment options are limited. There is uncertainty regarding the optimal use of the two FDA-approved lupus medications, hydroxychloroquine and belimumab, due in part to the risks of adverse treatment effects including hydroxychloroquine retinopathy and infection. This Career Development Award focuses on applying advanced clinical epidemiology and patient-centered decision science to integrate personalized risks of potential harms and benefits with patient preferences to guide the personalized, patient- centered use of key lupus medications, including specifically the optimal dose of hydroxychloroquine in SLE care.","A Personalized, Patient-Centered Approach to Optimizing Lupus Care",10192142,K23AR079040,"['Academy', 'Adverse effects', 'Award', 'Azathioprine', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Fellowship', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Harm Reduction', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Infection', 'Internal Medicine', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Life', 'Lupus', 'Machine Learning', 'Maryland', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycophenolate', 'Ophthalmology', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Premature Mortality', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Residencies', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment outcome', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'belimumab', 'care outcomes', 'catalyst', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'data access', 'dosage', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'renal damage', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'severe COVID-19', 'skills', 'therapy adverse effect', 'trend']",NIAMS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2021,174960
"Augmented Reality Platform for Telehealth Rehabilitiation Efforts to keep the most vulnerable individuals with chronic medical conditions from being exposed to COVID- 19 have triggered an unprecedented decline in the number of visits to ambulatory practices. The repercussions have impacted not only those with the disease, but the many millions of older persons in need of healthcare who forego in-person visits in fear of infection or for socioeconomic reasons. While the precipitating need for alternative healthcare delivery methods has hastened the adoption of software solutions, such as Zoom, traditional videoconferencing services fail to compensate for the lack of direct physical evaluations with a patient that is needed for evaluating musculoskeletal (MSK) deficits, planning therapeutic interventions, and guiding exercise compliance—essential components of evidence-based practice among rehabilitation practitioners. To overcome these shortcomings, our team of computer vision and human movement engineers is partnering with orthopedic rehabilitation specialists at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) to develop a telehealth platform that fuses high resolution RGB and Depth (RGD-D) video data readily obtainable from a modern smartphone to facilitate quantitative, MSK assessment. The innovation builds upon our work in computing movement outcome measures from vision-based body tracking algorithms, and our skills in augmented reality (AR) software development to enhance a clinician’s assessment and exercise instruction capabilities. Our pilot data demonstrate that accurate quantitative rehabilitation outcomes are obtainable using RGB-D body tracking algorithms during a sub-set of knee activities. Phase I will advance these capabilities by deriving and validating the accuracy of 3D body tracking and rehabilitation outcome measures during a wider set of activities used clinically for assessing knee mobility, alignment, posture, balance, strength, and function from depth enabled smartphone video recordings in control subjects (Aim 1). Aim 2 will develop a proof-of-concept AR telehealth platform with the help of the MGH team that delivers an enhanced telehealth experience through real-time synchronized audio-visual processing, real-time display of quantitative rehabilitation outcomes for the therapist to assess deficits or guide exercise compliance, and instructional animations for the patient to safely carry out the rehabilitation activities. The proof-of-concept prototype will undergo feasibility testing in Aim 3 among n=5 physical therapists and n=10 patients with knee OA during a simulated telehealth session to achieve high ratings for usability, accessibility, and effectiveness. The results will inform the user-requirements of a more complete Phase II telehealth platform designed in close collaboration with industry partners to provide secure cloud based communication for seamless interoperability between devices; additional examination tools (e.g. gait analysis); a broader range of baseline assessment and therapeutic exercise protocols for additional MSK conditions; and HIPAA-compliant deployment and electronic documentation management. The final prototype system will be evaluated during actual telehealth visits at multiple clinical sites to promote safe and effective clinical care. PROJECT NARRATIVE With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, clinical care has by necessity shifted towards telehealth delivery for people at risk due to age, who live in underserved communities or avoid in-person visits out of fear of viral transmission. Existing telehealth software platforms are generally supportive of videoconferencing but have yet to provide rehabilitation professionals with quantitative outcomes typically obtained from direct physical evaluations with a patient. To overcome this shortcoming, we are developing an augmented reality platform that fuses RGB and depth imaging from a patient’s smartphone to deliver quantitative outcomes of knee joint mobility, alignment, posture, balance, strength and function during a telehealth visit to support the mandate for more effective remote delivery of evidence-based rehabilitation during the global pandemics and beyond.",Augmented Reality Platform for Telehealth Rehabilitiation,10256844,R43AG072991,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Augmented Reality', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Fright', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Care Visit', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Instruction', 'Intuition', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical Rehabilitation', 'Physical therapy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quarantine', 'Rehabilitation Outcome', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Specialist', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablets', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Therapeutic exercise', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Videoconferencing', 'Virtual Tool', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'animation', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cloud based', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'gait examination', 'health care delivery', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'joint mobilization', 'new technology', 'outpatient programs', 'pandemic disease', 'partial recovery', 'patient safety', 'physical therapist', 'prototype', 'remote delivery', 'skills', 'socioeconomics', 'software development', 'telehealth', 'tool', 'underserved community', 'usability', 'viral transmission', 'visual processing']",NIA,"ALTEC, INC.",R43,2021,286972
"Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis Acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), resulting from drug exposure, infection or autoimmune disease, is the cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) in up to 20% of patients who undergo a kidney biopsy. Even though we currently have 2 clinical interventions available to treat patients with AIN (withdrawal of the offending drug and corticosteroids), 40-60% of patients with AIN go on to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD) even when appropriately treated. Kidney damage in AIN is believed to result from immune-mediated tubular injury that eventually leads to fibrosis and permanent kidney damage.  The recent dileniation of the immune underpinnings of multiple autoimmune diseases and cancers has led to the development of targeted therapies that exhibit improved efficacy and less toxicity compared to corticosteroids. Therefore, an analysis of the immune infiltrate and resulting resident cell (tubular and vascular) responses that provides pathogenic understanding of the specific immune events that initiate and propogate AIN should lead to development and/or repurposing of targeted therapies that are more effective at resolving AIN and preventing the progression to CKD, as well as potentially less toxic.  Data from several groups, including our own, suggest that CD4+ T-helper cells (particularly the TH2/TH9 subsets) are potential drivers of AIN. We have found that TH2/TH9 cytokines IL-5 and IL-9 and some cells of type 2 immunity, mast cells and eosinophils, are higher in the urine or kidneys of patients with AIN. Based on these data, it is our hypothesis that TH2/TH9 T-helper cells in the kidney itself play an important pathogenic role in promoting tubular or vascular injury in AIN. We will test this hypothesis by performing a quantitative evaluation of the kidney immune infiltrate and accompanying tubular and vascular response in humans with AIN. We will use existing kidney biopsies, adjudicated by 3 nephropathologists as exhibiting AIN, from two university health centers (Yale and Johns Hopkins), as discovery and validation cohorts for this study. To perform the quantitative analysis we will use an imaging technique called Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) that supports the simultaneous, spatially-preserved quantification of up to 42 antibodies on a single tissue section. We have an existing library of 27 validated kidney and immune antibodies and have developed a machine learning protocol to rapidly and accurately quantify and localize all cells in the human kidney identified using IMC.  We will first increase our validated antibody panel and optimize our IMC protocol for use in the study of AIN (SA 1). We will then use IMC to identify, quantify and localize the immune and resident cell responses in 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN control biopsies from Yale (discovery cohort), followed by 30 AIN cases and 60 non-AIN controls from JHU (validation cohort, SA 2). Finally, we will define the relationship between cellular determinants of AIN and recovery of kidney function as well as response to steroids (SA3). Our findings will not only lead to identification of novel druggable targets in AIN, but also lead to improving clinical histological diagnosis of AIN. Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN) is an important cause of kidney dysfunction, and can lead to chronic kidney disease in many patients. We know that AIN occurs as an immune response in the kidney to certain drugs or infections, but do not have a clear understanding of the cell sources of the inflammation or the tubular and vascular responses. This proposal is designed to define these immune events in human kidney biopsy samples left over after clinical diagnosis has been completed, and to determine how they relate to the development of chronic kidney disease.",Defining the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Human Acute Interstitial Nephritis,10264054,R01DK126815,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Archives', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Delayed Hypersensitivity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fibrosis', 'Formalin', 'Health', 'Helper-Inducer T-Lymphocyte', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukin-9', 'Interstitial Nephritis', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Neighborhoods', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reaction', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Steroids', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Preservation', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Tubular formation', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Virus Diseases', 'Withdrawal', 'adjudicate', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'eosinophil', 'exhaust', 'improved', 'injured', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney dysfunction', 'mast cell', 'multiphoton imaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'renal damage', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'targeted treatment', 'vascular injury']",NIDDK,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,528629
"Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility. Project abstract Asthma and obesity are two of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and are increasing in prevalence in the US and worldwide. Obesity and asthma are linked: as body mass index increases, the risk of asthma also increases. Asthma is not a single disease, but a group of overlapping phenotypes caused by multiple distinct molecular mechanisms, many of which remain undefined. Obese asthmatics have a severe phenotype of asthma that is poorly responsive to standard medication regimens and often characterized by more severe exacerbations, most of which are due to viral infections. However, the underlying immunometabolic mechanism leading to immune dysfunction in obese asthma remains unclear. To address this and establish testable hypotheses, I conducted a pilot study of pediatric asthmatics (A), obese asthmatics (OA), obese (O) and healthy control (HC) patients using multiple high dimensional assays, including mass cytometry, metabolomics and serum cytokine measurements. This study showed that obese asthmatics have two forms of immune dysregulation that may impair anti-viral responses: increased type 2 immunity and CD8 T cell exhaustion. In addition, OA patients have alterations in serum metabolites, including increased levels of glutamate, which may underlie some of these alterations in T cell state. Here, I intend to tackle the fundamental and tractable question of the nature of immune dysregulation in obese asthma by testing hypotheses derived from my human data using relevant mouse models of disease. First, I will test whether elevated levels of serum glutamate, a serum metabolite increased in OA patients, directly increases type 2 immunity (Aim 1). Second, I will confirm the presence of increased CD8 T cell exhaustion in a mouse model of OA and assess the impact of T cell exhaustion on influenza infection by measuring the impact of abrogating a core exhaustion pathway, the PD-1 pathway (Aim 2). Both aims will utilize novel techniques, including mass cytometry and immunometabolic studies. I will receive training in bioinformatics and biostatistical approaches to systems immunology, including machine learning, that will allow me to gain insight into these comprehensive, multifaceted datasets to establish the core pathways and targets that should be pursued as therapeutic targets in these complex patients. My proposal outlines a 5-year training program for my development as a physician-scientist in Pediatric Allergy Immunology. In particular, I will focus on gaining additional expertise in cutting-edge mass cytometry and systems immunology data analysis techniques, as well as mouse models of asthma and obesity. This will allow me to integrate complex human and mouse datasets, generating and testing mechanistic hypotheses with direct clinical applicability. I believe my training plan, within the remarkable environments in Dr. Wherry’s lab, CHOP and UPenn, will position me to become an independently funded physician scientist. Project Narrative Pediatric obese asthma is a severe disease that responds poorly to standard asthma medications and has higher rates of more severe viral asthma flares. Here, I have used a combination of advanced experimental methods and cutting-edge data analysis tools to uncover possible causes of immune system dysfunction in obese asthma that may play important roles in their poor anti-viral responses. Based on my data from patients, I will use mouse models of obese asthma to test whether changes in serum metabolites or immune exhaustion are important causes of the immune dysfunction observed in pediatric obese asthma.",Obesity dysregulates immune and metabolic status in asthma and alters infection susceptibility.,10063930,K08AI135091,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Allergens', 'Anti-Asthmatic Agents', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Antiviral Response', 'Asthma', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Caring', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Flare', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Hypersensitivity', 'IgE', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Interleukin-13', 'Knockout Mice', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'PD-1 pathway', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Activation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Supplementation', 'System', 'T cell differentiation', 'T cell response', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Th2 Cells', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Weights and Measures', 'Work', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'antiviral immunity', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthma model', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic patient', 'atopy', 'base', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cytokine', 'dimensional analysis', 'drinking water', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'influenza infection', 'influenzavirus', 'insight', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'pediatric patients', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'respiratory infection virus', 'response', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'translational approach']",NIAID,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K08,2021,186948

"A Dental implant registry of treatment outcomes of implant therapy by practitioners in the National Dental Practice Based Research Network There is a substantial body of literature to support that biological and prosthetic complications occur which may interfere with the health of the peri-implant tissues, the function and esthetics of the implant restoration. Peri-implant diseases are classified into peri-implant mucositis, inflammation restricted to the peri-implant mucosa, and peri-implantitis, characterized by peri-implant bone loss. The limitations of the current body of literature of biologic and prosthetic complications are based on many small studies and in large part conducted in an academic and specialty setting. We propose to create an implant registry within the National Dental Practice Based Research Network (NDPBRN) that will record the setting and implant therapy, the implants used, the prosthetic therapy provided and the rate of complications. The registry will create an opportunity for subsequent, additional targeted studies on specific complications available from the registry data and will lead to diagnosis driven therapy strategies. The target enrollment is a total of 2000 implants with prosthesis across the whole network. The one year UG3 Phase will be used to create a strategy to be able to meet the recruitment and enrollment objectives and to develop the protocol for data collection to facilitate the data gathering of the practitioners for the subjects they enroll. The data collection model we propose will be designed to be validated, concise, and easy to use for practitioners. We will develop a web based decision tree that will guide the practitioner through the data collection. The UH3 phase will recruit practitioners with representation of all 6 regions of the network that will enroll subjects with 2000 implants. Data collection will be detailed and comprehensive and will include surgical, prosthetic, and biologic aspects of implant therapy and radiographs for bone level assessments for a period of 3 years. The data will present clinically meaningful information about the prevalence of the various implant therapies, the incidence of prosthetic and biologic implant complications, risk factors for implant complications and evidence-based implant therapy strategies in every dental practices. We expect that the results from this study will significantly impact the clinical practice of implant dentistry and the quality of care provided for the patients. We propose to create an Implant Registry capturing implant therapy that is provided by practitioners within the NDPBRN. The aim is to determine the therapies associated with the greatest amount of success and the least amount of complications.

"A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  This application, “A novel data science and network analysis approach to quantifying facilitators and barriers of low tidal volume ventilation in an international consortium of medical centers,” is in response to PAR-16-238, Dissemination and Implementation Research in Health (R01). Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence (10% of intensive care unit admissions) and mortality up to 46%. Low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV) is the most effective therapy for ARDS, lowering mortality by 20-25%, and is part of standard practice. However, use of LTVV is as low as 19% of ARDS patients. There is a poor understanding of the barriers to LTVV adoption: current approaches are deficient because they incorporate biases, lack consistency and comprehensiveness, ignore the influence of interpersonal network- or team- based factors, and do not address setting-specific variation. Our research team has previously identified some patient- and clinician-specific facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption. We have used two state-of-the-art data driven methods—data science and network analysis—to preliminarily quantify the impact of a diverse array of potential factors affecting LTVV adoption, including network- and team-based factors. The proposed research is guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations theory. The overall goals of the proposed research are to understand the differences in facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings through a definitive, systematic study in a large, diverse consortium of medical centers, and to advance implementation science by providing a model for how data science and network analysis can be applied to understand the adoption of a complex intervention. The overarching hypothesis is that there are different patient-, clinician-, network-, and team-based facilitators and barriers to LTVV adoption in academic and community settings. We will determine whether different patient- and clinician- (Aim 1 cohort study, clinician survey, and data science analysis), clinician interpersonal network- (Aim 2 network analysis), and team structure and dynamics-based (Aim 3 team construction and modeling) facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption exist between academic and community hospital settings. Successful completion of the proposed research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the differences in the facilitators of and barriers to LTVV adoption between academic and community settings, and will advance implementation science by serving as a model of how data science and network analysis can be applied to complex implementation problems. Implementation strategies that account for all these factors may be more likely to lead to significant practice change. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has high prevalence and mortality among critically ill patients; low tidal volume ventilation is the most effective therapy for ARDS but is used infrequently. Successful completion of the proposed research will identify differences in the facilitators of and barriers to adoption of low tidal volume ventilation between academic and community hospital settings in a large and diverse consortium of medical centers.

"Identifying biomarker signatures of prognostic value for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT In adults, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits a wide range of clinical outcomes, from asymptomatic and mild disease to severe viral pneumonia, respiratory distress, acute kidney injury, thrombotic disorders, and serious cardiac, cerebrovascular and vascular complications. Severe infection can also occur both in children and young adults (< 21), and a significant proportion of children admitted with Covid-19 require ICU support, frequently including mechanical ventilation. In addition, children and adolescents with initially asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection have presented with a rare, but very severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). Epidemiologic, clinical and laboratory predictors of progression towards severe forms of acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 and MIS-C are thus urgently needed in the fight against Covid-19 in this population. As defined in the NIH Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) program, biomarker discovery can enable risk stratification and guide interventional studies to target Covid-19 patients at enhanced risk of developing complications and/or severe disease. To target this discovery initiative, herein we will use a battery of biological, immunological and molecular tests, including Grating-Coupled Fluorescence Plasmonic (GCFP) and advanced flow cytometry, to study children and young adults (<21 years) with mild, moderate or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. GCFP allows the use of disposable biosensor chips that can be mass-produced at low cost and spotted in microarray format to greatly increase multiplexing capabilities. In addition, we will use a similar biomarker approach for rapid differentiation of patients with MIS-C versus other pediatric infectious or inflammatory conditions where the clinical presentation resembles MIS-C, most importantly Kawasaki disease. A child’s biologic and immunologic response to SARS-CoV-2 exposure is likely influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, epigenetics and products of the mucosa/gut-brain axis, adipose tissue and neuroendocrine immune network, and further modulated by environmental exposures. With these factors in mind, we hypothesize that a child’s biomarker profile in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection enables a timely and accurate prediction of severity of Covid-19 and diagnosis of MIS-C, and will help guide treatment strategies, and predict patient outcomes. To test this hypothesis, we will use a non-traditional diagnostic and comprehensive biomarker discovery to characterize the clinical and laboratory spectrum of children and adolescents with mild, moderate and severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as MIS-C. We will then validate our newly developed diagnostic and prognostic algorithm to distinguish MIS-C from other inflammatory disorders with overlapping clinical manifestations, including Kawasaki disease, and predict the longitudinal risk of complications. PROJECT NARRATIVE SARS-CoV-2 infection has harshly impacted health care outcomes in children and young adults. This groundbreaking project will employ multiple state-of-the-art technologies and approaches to evaluate children and young adults (<21), enrolled in the United States and Colombia, across the spectrum of clinical manifestations of Covid-19 to identify and validate biomolecules or bacterial signatures with diagnostic and prognostic value.",Identifying biomarker signatures of prognostic value for Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C),10273778,R61HD105613,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Asthma', 'Attention', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biosensor', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 outbreak', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Cardiac', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colombia', 'Coupled', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Europe', 'Exhibits', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Genetic', 'Gut Mucosa', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunologics', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention Studies', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mind', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Native Americans', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Population', 'RADx', 'Reporting', 'Respiratory distress', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombosis', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral Pneumonia', 'Virus', 'Youth', 'acute infection', 'arm', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker signature', 'biosignature', 'care outcomes', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'fight against', 'gut-brain axis', 'instrument', 'microbiome analysis', 'mortality', 'pediatric patients', 'plasmonics', 'potential biomarker', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'severe COVID-19', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NICHD,CONNECTICUT CHILDREN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R61,2021,877921
"In Vivo Cluster AI Prediction (CLAIRE) of COVID-19 Disease Progression ABSTRACT The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, which early this year forced entire countries into lockdown, has reached a global death toll of 890,000+ by early September 2020. Based on the high number of COVID-19 cases that are asymptomatic but infectious, an estimated reproductive rate of infection of about 2 and a high mutation rate, it is expected that the virus will remain in the population as the influenza virus does. For hospitals serving areas whose economy relies on international travel, tourism, and cruise ship tourism, such as Miami-Dade county, new COVID-19 cases related to travel will require treatment during infection outbreaks which will strain health systems, especially during the infectious respiratory disease season in the winter. Patient risk factors during the current COVID-19 outbreak as well as during other viral outbreaks, such as seasonal influenza, are poorly characterized, consequently negatively affecting patient care. The saliva microbiome, which includes viruses and bacteria, is not currently used as in diagnostic tools. However, it may reveal risk factors associated with severe disease and/or a fatal outcome, and it allows for the detection and study of the viral RNA sequence for potential contact tracing and molecular epidemiology, all of which affect both vaccine and antiviral efficacy. In this proposed study, Lifetime Omics will develop CLAIRE, a proof-of-concept in vivo cluster AI platform for predicting disease progression of viral infectious respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 through the analysis of the saliva metagenome. The University of Miami Medical Group Infection Control (UMMGIC) division will collaborate in this effort by collecting saliva samples from COVID-19 patients with de-identified clinical information. The samples will undergo metagenomic sequencing and Lifetime Omics will repurpose algorithms used for prediction of in vivo HIV evolution to perform genetic/phylogenetic analysis on SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences, estimating mutation rate and immune selection pressures and identifying both the in vivo quasispecies clusters and the geographic cluster to which the patient belongs. The CLAIRE models will be trained with public datasets and tested on the metagenomic sequences generated from saliva samples of UMMGIC patients with the goal of assisting physicians in predicting disease progression in COVID-19. NARRATIVE During the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult for physicians admitting new patients to the hospital to distinguish patients whose disease will be mild from those who will have a severe disease progression. While this can also occur with the seasonal flu and other infectious respiratory diseases, the degree of severity seen in COVID-19, the potential of accelerated deterioration, and the high pressure on hospital resources for extended periods of time present a compelling and urgent need to better understand and anticipate the risk factors that may drive severe disease. Lifetime Omics is developing CLAIRE, a viral cluster AI system for prediction of infectious respiratory disease progression, such as COVID-19, using metagenomics and AI to provide personalized information to inform treatment decisions, help improve outcomes, and better utilize healthcare resources.",In Vivo Cluster AI Prediction (CLAIRE) of COVID-19 Disease Progression,10256828,R43EB030947,"['2019-nCoV', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 outbreak', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Contact Tracing', 'Coronavirus', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Influenza', 'International', 'Lifting', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Infection', 'Process', 'Quarantine', 'RNA Sequences', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Ships', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'anti-viral efficacy', 'base', 'co-infection', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'health care service utilization', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'infection rate', 'influenzavirus', 'markov model', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'negative affect', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient subsets', 'phase 1 study', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'reproductive', 'saliva analysis', 'saliva sample', 'seasonal influenza', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vaccine efficacy', 'viral RNA']",NIBIB,"LIFETIME OMICS, INC.",R43,2021,248723
"Learning to Predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia with Novel Continuous Cerebral Arterial State Index Project Summary  Delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) is the most devastating complication after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) and has an incidence rate of 30%. Current practice relies on intermittent assessment of neurological status and daily cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) to guide medical management to prevent DCI. Only after medical management fails, is endovascular treatment (EVT) including intraarterial vasodilator infusion and/or intracranial angioplasty initiated. This reactive practice does not account for early predictors of DCI and may miss the optimal EVT window at an early stage of DCI development before symptoms or severe deviations from normal hemodynamics. The goal of this project is to develop algorithms to predict DCI and related targets at an early stage in their development. An accurate prediction of DCI will enable a more proactive strategy to prevent and treat the underlying cause of DCI.  The following three aims will be pursued towards the goal of the project: 1) Develop aSAH-specific intracranial pressure (ICP) pulse-based cerebral arterial state index; 2) Develop and validate predictive models of targets related to delayed cerebral ischemia after aSAH; 3) Conduct a prospective institution- specific adaption and validation of the developed models.  Our DCI predictive algorithms only need data available in current clinical practice hence they can be readily adopted. If validated, these algorithms will enable clinicians to monitor risk of DCI continuously and to proactively deliver appropriate treatment. The proposed prospective study of algorithm implementation and adaptation will well prepare future clinical trials to test the efficacy of algorithm-informed interventions.

"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,10141224,K01DK120784,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data repository', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2021,129110
"Identifying effective and efficient approaches to tuberculosis screening in Brazilianprisons Abstract. The goal of this career development plan is to support Dr. Leonardo Martinez, an infectious disease epidemiologist, in developing an independent research program focused on increasing tuberculosis case detection in high-risk groups. In active tuberculosis case finding studies, the majority of individuals are unable to provide sputum. In our previous work in Brazilian prisons, mass screening for tuberculosis among incarcerated individuals found a hyperendemic level of disease burden, 3,900 cases per 100,000 prisoners. We hypothesize that the tuberculosis burden in these prisons is greater than our current estimates, as a majority of prisoners were unable to produce sputum and therefore were not evaluated by diagnostic tools such as GeneXpert, culture, and smear testing. A re-assessment of the tuberculosis burden is urgently needed in this setting as well as an assessment of the feasibility and value of non-sputum-based diagnostic tools to increase case detection and reduce ongoing transmission. Dr. Martinez proposes to: (1) measure the prevalence of undiagnosed TB and characteristics of tuberculosis among Brazilian prisoners who are unable to provide sputum samples at the baseline screening visit; (2) determine the feasibility and sensitivity of Mask Aerosol Sampling system (MASS), a novel tool that directly captures exhaled Mycobacterium tuberculosis from patients, during a mass screening intervention; and (3) identify cost-effective algorithms for tuberculosis screening in prisons. The proposed project will leverage an NIH-funded R01 study (AI130058-01, PI, Andrews/Croda) by the primary mentors, which is ongoing and enrolls adults in several prisons located in Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. This research plan forms the basis of a 5-year career development plan for Dr. Martinez under the mentorship of Drs. Jason Andrews (infectious diseases, epidemiology), Julie Parsonnet (adult infectious diseases), Julio Croda (infectious diseases, health policy), Yvonne Maldonado (pediatric infectious diseases), and Upinder Singh (infectious diseases) with consultants Robert Horsburgh (clinical epidemiology), Michael Barer (tuberculosis diagnostics), and Jeremy Goldhaber-Fiebert (cost-effectiveness analyses). This interdisciplinary group has developed a career development program for Dr. Martinez that includes: (1) fostering skills in designing field-based research and data collection; (2) application of statistical methods for the study of novel diagnostics; (3) effective usage of and experience with new advanced statistical methodologies related to decision-tree algorithmic creation, cost- effectiveness analysis, and mathematical modeling; (4) regular meetings with mentors and consultants; (5) presenting results at scientific meetings and seminars; (6) publishing in peer-reviewed journals; and (7) writing and submitting an R01 grant. Completion of this career development plan will allow Dr. Martinez to successfully compete for extramural funding in the future to continue researching non-sputum-based tuberculosis diagnostics in high-risk populations. Project Narrative. Increasing tuberculosis case detection, especially in high-risk groups, is critical to meet the World Health Organization’s End TB Strategy to reduce tuberculosis incidence by 90% globally by 2035. A significant barrier to achieving this goal is that a large proportion of patients are unable to produce sputum and are therefore are not evaluated with commonly used and recommended diagnostics such as GeneXpert, culture, and smear testing. The overall goal of this proposal is to identify and quantify the burden of undiagnosed tuberculosis in Brazilian prisoners, evaluate the feasibility and value of non-sputum-based diagnostics to improve case detection in this setting, and to identify cost-effective algorithms for tuberculosis screening in prisons.",Identifying effective and efficient approaches to tuberculosis screening in Brazilianprisons,10105242,K01AI156022,"['Adult', 'Aerosols', 'Algorithms', 'Brazil', 'Characteristics', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Contracts', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Exhalation', 'Extramural Activities', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Health Policy', 'Imprisonment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Masks', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Natural History', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prisoner', 'Prisons', 'Program Development', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Sputum', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'Writing', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'case finding', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'point of care', 'programs', 'routine screening', 'screening', 'skills', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tuberculosis diagnostics']",NIAID,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,K01,2021,128574
"Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus Abstract Lupus nephritis (LN) is one of the most serious manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Current clinical laboratory markers lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity to optimize individual patient care creating a need to develop novel biomarkers for LN. To address this unmet need there has been a significant effort within the lupus research community to identify novel LN biomarkers, but to date none have been qualified for clinical use. We speculate that one of the important causes of these failures is that no single biomarker can account for the heterogeneity of SLE or LN. Under the hypothesis that multiple categories of biomarkers can represent different aspects of risk for LN, we propose to assess biomarkers that are classified into categories of disease susceptibility, systemic inflammation, and kidney compartment/cell injury to build models for risk prediction. Our objective is to develop composite biomarkers for early detection of renal flares, chronic renal damage, and treatment response of LN patients. To accomplish this goal we will use biospecimens from longitudinal observational cohorts and clinical trials that have well-annotated patient samples. The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) team therefore proposes to partner with the Ohio State University (OSU) team to combine each group's longitudinal SLE cohorts and create a well-phenotyped patient resource suited to biomarker discovery and large enough to adequately power validation studies. The combined OSU-MUSC cohort will have approximately 500 LN patients who have had rheumatology/nephrology clinic visits and biospecimens collected every two to six months for up to ten years. Using these samples, our collective team has already described several DNA, serum and urine biomarkers that are associated with disease activity, treatment response or organ damage in LN, and has considerable experience in developing biomarker panels for outcomes in LN. We have reviewed the last decade's literature, systematically ranked novel biomarkers, and propose to test the top performing LN biomarkers in this proposal to address whether: (i) Biomarkers associated with active LN can be used to predict impending renal flares in prospective longitudinal cohorts; (ii) Baseline measures of composite panels of urine or serum biomarkers can distinguish between who will and who will not achieve a renal response to one year of conventional therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; (iii) The development of genetic risk profiles of LN patients to identify those who are predisposed to develop chronic kidney damage. We will also compare biomarkers predictive of disease outcomes in LN to those in non-renal SLE, working towards developing LN specific vs general biomarker panels that are indicative of active inflammation and/or damage accrual. Our ultimate goal is to have validated LN predictors of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be clinically relevant, and that can be easily assayed in most clinical service laboratories to improve patient care. Relevance to Public Health Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease that can lead to serious kidney damage and death. Given the high incidence of end stage kidney disease in minority women afflicted with lupus nephritis, it is essential to develop surrogate biomarkers to be able to predict impending disease flares, treatment response, and renal damage. The development of validated biomarker panels will pave the way towards better clinical management of patients who have lupus nephritis.",Predictive Biomarkers for disease activity and organ damage in patients with lupus,10152359,R01AR071947,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aliquot', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Services', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine clearance measurement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Failure', 'Flare', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'In complete remission', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Lupus', 'Lupus Nephritis', 'Maintenance Therapy', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Nephrology', 'Odds Ratio', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Probability', 'Proteinuria', 'Public Health', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'South Carolina', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Failure', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vasculitis', 'Woman', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'conventional therapy', 'ds-DNA', 'early detection biomarkers', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'mortality', 'mycophenolate mofetil', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'renal damage', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'sex', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapy development', 'treatment response', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R01,2021,628779
"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication.

"Combining Voice and Genetic Information to Detect Heterogeneity in Major Depressive Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY This application aims to advance our understanding of major depressive disorder (MDD) by combining genetic information and analyzing speech patterns of those with MDD to identify subtypes. MDD is the leading cause of disability throughout the world, yet, relative to other common disorders, less is known about its origins. There are less effective treatments and much less is spent on trying to understand how it arises and how to cure it. Current treatments are relatively ineffective, with up 50% of patients refractory and many suffering severe recurrence. Understanding the mechanisms underlying MDD has been recognized as a grand challenge in global mental health. Thus, developing new treatments for MDD is a major priority for public health. A major challenge for MDD research is the presence of heterogeneity. The existence of multiple subtypes of MDD has been suspected for a long time, and likely confounds the ability to treat the disorder appropriately with existing treatments, as well as making it hard to identify the causes of MDD as a prelude to developing new treatments. However finding subtypes has been hard. Given that the way people talk can reflect alterations in mood, we expect voice to be able to predict mood, and hence potentially be used as biomarker to recognize heterogeneity. In preliminary data show that in combination with genetic data high-dimensional vocal features extracted from recordings can be used to identify subtypes. Furthermore, the use of genetic data allows us to impute voice features into large biobanks where no recordings exist, making it possible to explore the relationship between vocal features and a rich array of clinically important indicators. We explore the power of voice to make a diagnosis of MDD, to predict severity and other clinical features. Applying our approach to will inform clinical management, improving diagnosis, refine treatment and aid the development of new treatments PROJECT NARRATIVE The research proposed here will contribute to an understanding of major depressive disorder, the commonest psychiatric disorder and a leading cause of disability throughout the world. The proposal will combine information from voice recordings and genetics to identify subtypes of depression and develop robust predictors of mood, severity of illness and other clinical indicators.

"Early detection, containment, and management of COVID-19 in dialysis facilities using multi-modal data sources Abstract With older age and multiple comorbidities, dialysis patients are at high risk for serious complications, even death, from COVID-19. There is a large disproportionate representation of minorities, especially Blacks and Hispanics. Over 85% of hemodialysis patients travel three times a week to dialysis facilities to receive life-sustaining treatments and cannot shelter in place. There is a critical need to characterize COVID-19 transmission pathways in dialysis patients and clinics, identify potential coronavirus carriers, and develop procedures to curb the spread. With regular medical encounters, a large amount of data has been collected for each patient over time. These data have not been fully utilized for COVID-19 prediction and control in dialysis clinics. In this proposal, we seek to leverage demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, socioeconomic, serological, metabolomic, wearable and machine-integrated sensors, and COVID-19 surveillance data to develop mathematical and statistical models and implement them in a large number of dialysis clinics. The mathematical and statistical modeling using multiple data resources will help us understand how COVID-19 spread in dialysis facilities, identify potential COVID-19 patients before symptoms appear, and identify potential asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We will develop novel mathematical and statistical models that fully utilize the high dimensional multimodal data available to us and other dialysis providers. We capitalize on the intrinsic advantages of hemodialysis clinics to implement and validate the proposed prediction models. We firmly believe that this cross-disciplinary effort will improve patients’ and staff’s safety while delivering high-quality, individualized care to a high-risk population.

"Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics ABSTRACT As compared to whites, African Americans (AA) develop hypertension (HTN) at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of HTN, poorer control of blood pressure (BP), and have twice the mortality rate from HTN. For 47 years our department has been developing computer simulations of integrative physiology for research purposes. The current model, HumMod, is comprised of 14 organ systems, and includes neural, endocrine, circulatory, and renal physiology. We have created tools that generate and analyze large cohorts of computer-generated (virtual) patients. With these techniques HumMod has been used for hypothesis generation and for understanding underlying physiological mechanisms that are not able to be determined in either whole animal or human experiments. This proposed work will use these tools and this mathematical model of human physiology to develop a realistic AA virtual population for studying antihypertensive therapies that have well-known (diuretic or salt reduction), variable (angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibition), or unclear (renal denervation (RDX), and baroreflex activation therapy (BAT) therapeutic efficacies in AA. Published data from our laboratory show that our model is robust and can realistically simulate salt sensitivity, multiple types of HTN, and device-based antihypertensive therapy. As shown in our preliminary data, we have successfully created a virtual population that was similar to the clinical data (AA population with resistant HTN) in 5-dimensions (blood pressure, heart rate, glomerular filtration rate, cardiac output, and peripheral resistance) and have conducted in silico trials for new device-based therapy currently being evaluated for the treatment of resistant HTN—namely RDX, BAT, and arteriovenous fistula. Based on these preliminary data, we hypothesize that these techniques will allow us to investigate the physiological mechanisms responsible for the variation in response to therapy in a wide range of AA patient types and predict the likelihood of success for a particular treatment. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that a virtual AA population with resistant HTN can be successfully calibrated and validated. Aim 2 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that in silico trials using the calibrated populations from the first Aim can be used for testing and predicting mechanisms of nonresponse to device-based antihypertensive therapies. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that our predictive analytic techniques can be used to identify mechanisms and proxy markers of therapeutic resistance in hypertensive AA. These proposed studies have clinical relevance because they address a leading cause of morbidity and mortality as well as potential mechanisms of therapeutic resistance in an underserved and understudied minority. Furthermore, these applications and the potential insights gleaned from our physiological model and predictive analytic tools may have broad implications for BP control in other resistant hypertensive populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans develop hypertension and its co-morbidities at an earlier age, have a greater frequency and severity of hypertension, have poorer control of blood pressure, and die disproportionately (2-fold) more from hypertension as compared to whites. Despite these known disparities, there has been little attention or advancement in the management of blood pressure in the African American population. Our laboratory’s advanced physiological model paired with novel analytic tools may mechanistically predict the types of patients that should respond to therapy, ultimately improving patient drug regimens and their success rate in this underserved and understudied population.",Improving Hypertension Treatment in African Americans Using Computational Modeling and Predictive Analytics,10268976,K99MD014738,"['Address', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aldosterone Antagonists', 'Angiotensin II', 'Animals', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Attention', 'Baroreflex', 'Blood Pressure', 'Calcium Channel', 'Cardiac Output', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Study', 'Data', 'Denervation', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Diuretics', 'Endocrine', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Glean', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Heart Rate', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Kidney', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Obesity', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptidyl-Dipeptidase A', 'Peripheral Resistance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Publishing', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistant Hypertension', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Sodium Chloride', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'blood pressure regulation', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'computer generated', 'data warehouse', 'experimental study', 'genetic epidemiology', 'human model', 'hypertension control', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'in silico', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'physiologic model', 'relating to nervous system', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'simulation', 'success', 'therapeutic biomarker', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model', 'virtual patient']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,K99,2021,101117
"Using Remote Sensing Technology to Assess Parent-Infant Interactions as a Mechanism Linking COVID-related Stress and Infant Neurobehavioral Functioning The young child’s ability to regulate stress sets the foundation for a host of developmental outcomes, and the parent-infant relationship is the primary context in which stress regulation capacities first develop. Prior research underscores how parents’ own stress may lead to disturbances in parent-infant co-regulation of stress. Given the immense disruptions to family life resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to understand the degree to which COVID-related stress may impact the parent-infant relationship and ultimately infants’ neurobehavioral outcomes. We posit here that (a) maternal stress due to the pandemic will be associated with disturbances in the mother-infant relationship, particularly with respect to mother-infant co- regulation of infant distress and (b) mothers’ experiences of COVID-related stress will have an indirect effect on infant neurobehavioral outcomes, in part, due to disturbances to the mother-infant relationship. We also aim to investigate risk factors (e.g., maternal depressive symptoms, substance use; infant negative emotionality) that might exacerbate such linkages, as well as protective factors (e.g., maternal social support, coping) that may attenuate them. We will partner with six sites from the NIH HEALthy Brain and Child Development Study- Phase 1 (New York University, Oregon Health Sciences University, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, Arkansas Children’s Research Institute) that will permit addressing the proposed aims among a geographically diverse sample of 240 families with infants between 6 and 18 months of age. To assess key constructs relevant to mother-infant relationship disturbance, we will use a novel multimodal sensing platform that captures infant vocalizations, stress physiology, and motor behavior, and we will employ machine learn approaches to these multimodal data to yield automated assessments of mother-infant co-regulation of infant distress. By combining assessments of (a) mothers’ COVID-related experiences, as well as maternal, family, and infant functioning, collected by the six HBCD sites via maternal reports and virtual visits and (b) mother-infant co-regulation of stress in home environments using remote multimodal sensing technology, the current study will provide unique opportunities for a nuanced and rich understanding of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on infants born during this unprecedented time. Downstream effects of COVID-19 on infants’ neurobehavioral outcomes are likely to be transmitted, in part, through disruptions in the parent-infant relationship due to parents’ heightened stress and poorer mental health. This project will investigate such downstream effects using novel technology and machine learning methods that permit remote assessment of infants and parents in the home. Results from this project may aid in the development of “just-in-time” interventions for parents and infants at risk for relationships disturbance.",Using Remote Sensing Technology to Assess Parent-Infant Interactions as a Mechanism Linking COVID-related Stress and Infant Neurobehavioral Functioning,10239919,R34DA050256,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Arkansas', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Child Development', 'Church', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Community Services', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Home Economics', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Intervention', 'Job loss', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Mind', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'New York', 'North Carolina', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social support', 'Speech', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transact', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'caregiving', 'coping', 'coronavirus disease', 'depressive symptoms', 'economic impact', 'experience', 'falls', 'infancy', 'infection rate', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'maternal stress', 'motor behavior', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neurobehavioral', 'new technology', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'patient home care', 'phase 1 study', 'physical conditioning', 'protective factors', 'remote sensing', 'resilience', 'sensor technology', 'social culture', 'stressor', 'virtual', 'virtual visit', 'vocalization']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R34,2021,234822
"Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Abstract: The high aerosolized transmissibility of COVID, long asymptomatic incubation period, and highly variable presentation attributes of the COVID pandemic have proven challenging in many settings where patchwork pandemic responses have disproportionately negatively impacted vulnerable socioeconomic, minority, and disabled sub-populations. Unfortunately, these dire trends are only made more acute in settings that feature populations with limited mobility and little to no ability to self-isolate (dense concentrated populations [DCPs]), such as residential nursing homes, schools, drug rehabilitation services, prison and psychiatric facility populations, and high-frequency essential medical services, such as chemotherapy infusion clinics or dialysis units. In these DCP settings, limited diagnostic testing, prolonged indoor contact, limitations in cleaning and filtration capacities, support staff shortages, pre-existing comorbidities, and lack of effective infectious disease surveillance systems all collude to drive an increased COVID burden in DCPs. From this, it is clear that alternative detection strategies for DCPs are urgently needed to improve local capacity to monitor COVID outbreaks, mitigate their spread, and thus reduce inequitable disease and mortality burdens in these under-resourced and often overcrowded settings. In previous work, we developed a first generation detection system using heart rate data from commercially-available Fitbit Ionic wearable devices to detect the onset of COVID and other infectious diseases up to 10 days before users self-reported symptom onset (overall sensitivity 67% prior to symptom onset). Here, we propose to further develop this system for the improved detection of COVID and other infectious diseases in DCPs using existing wearable fitness devices in a wireless and interoperable digital health framework that centralizes all wearable-derived data on PHD while tailoring its presentation and health event alert system to the IT capabilities and needs of each DCP setting. In this, not only will we adapt our existing infection detection algorithms for each DCP’s particular baseline characteristics, IT infrastructure, and needs, but also use incoming data to further optimize the performance of those algorithms for continuous improvement in the sensitivity, specificity, and alert lead time for COVID onset. This will quickly enable under-resourced DCP support staff to access and use world-class COVID surveillance data in identifying individual infection events, implementing isolation, cleaning, and testing policies, and minimizing transmission, thus reducing the burden of COVID in DCP settings and reducing DCP morbidity and mortality overall. Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations Narrative: The myriad risks and health burdens accompanying the ongoing COVID pandemic have disproportionately impacted under-resourced settings with dense, concentrated populations that cannot readily transition to isolation or remote care. While diagnostic testing is increasingly available, it remains inaccessible to too many and highlights an urgent unmet need for alternative methods to detect COVID infection and spread. In previous work using online machine learning and commercially-available fitness wearables, we have demonstrated remote detection of COVID onset up to 7 days in advance of symptoms, which we here propose to optimize and extend to diverse dense concentrated population settings for ongoing and effective COVID surveillance.",Multi-Modal Wireless COVID Monitoring & Infection Alerts for Concentrated Populations,10274232,R01NR020105,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'COVID detection', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID test', 'COVID testing', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Filtration', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Informed Consent', 'Infrastructure', 'Infusion procedures', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prisons', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Reporting', 'Residential Facilities', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'aerosolized', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'dashboard', 'data acquisition', 'demographics', 'design', 'detection platform', 'digital health', 'drug rehabilitation', 'fitbit', 'fitness', 'higher education', 'improved', 'interoperability', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'operation', 'pandemic disease', 'rehabilitation service', 'remote health care', 'response', 'smartphone Application', 'socioeconomics', 'stem', 'surveillance data', 'surveillance study', 'transmission process', 'trend', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NINR,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1121730
"Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations PROJECT SUMMARY  Large confirmatory or pragmatic clinical trials enroll patients from multiple centers to obtain high-quality evidence useful for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. The design of multicenter trials is particularly appealing to policymakers because many tend to be pragmatic and offer access to a large sample of diverse patient populations. Decision-makers trying to use the results of multicenter trials have specific target populations in mind. Yet, selection at both the center and individual participant level challenges the ability of even well-designed and conducted multicenter trials to draw inferences about any meaningful target population. These selection mechanisms, even in impeccably conducted multicenter trials, result in samples of trial participants that are not representative of any specific target population. When treatment effects are heterogeneous over covariates that are differentially distributed across centers, the overall trial average treatment effect estimate will not apply to any one of the populations underlying the participating centers or the target population. Consider for example, the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a large multicenter trial of 33 centers (53,456 individuals) across the United States, which motivated this proposal. Because the positive benefits of screening are mainly concentrated in individuals at high-risk for lung cancer it is critical that individuals are appropriately targeted for screening recommendations. Our long-term objective is to optimize the applicability of trial results into clinical practice. We will take steps toward this objective by achieving the following specific aims: (1) Develop robust and efficient statistical methods, that can be combined with modern machine learning techniques, to reinterpret a multicenter trial in the context of each of the participating centers and to transport inferences from a multicenter trial to a new target population; (2) Evaluate the performance of methods developed in Aim 1 in simulation studies that reflect real-world data by considering scenarios with different sample sizes, number of centers, treatment effects, and outcome or selection mechanisms; (3) Apply the methods in the NLST to reinterpret the trial in the context of one of the participating centers and to transport trial findings to a new target population using baseline data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative survey of the United States general population. The proposed work is innovative for analyzing multicenter trials because it develops new methods, clarifies the assumptions needed for obtaining valid inference, and empirically assesses method performance. This work is significant because as a result of applying these methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials. Insights gained from this work will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will improve the value of multicenter trials for decision-making in diverse healthcare systems. Selection bias at both the individual and center level challenge the applicability of trial findings to populations often underrepresented in trials, such as women, ethnic/racial minorities, or the elderly. This work aligns with AHRQ’s mission and priority areas because as a result of applying these proposed methods, policymakers will be able to learn about treatment effects in different underlying target populations and produce high-quality evidence of interventions in diverse populations that are often unrepresented in trials, where decisions must be made.",Transporting effects using a multicenter randomized study to different target populations,10228266,R36HS028373,[' '],AHRQ,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R36,2021,43083
"Novel Approaches to Advance Coordinated Registry Networks (CRNs). Project Summary The technological transformation of US health care with the explosion of new devices and iterative changes mandates the acquisition of real-world evidence (RWE) to study devices and technologies pragmatically. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has spearheaded the RWE framework development in the pursuit of sufficient evidence that is required for regulatory decision-making such as device approvals and surveillance. With regulatory support since the launch of the National Medical Device Registry Task Force in 2015, the Medical Device Epidemiology Network (MDEpiNet) created 15 national and international coordinated registry networks (CRNs), which develop or link well-curated national RWE sources such as registries, administrative, and electronic health records (EHRs) data. The MDEpiNet is a key partner of the National Evaluation System of Technologies (NEST) coordinating center and is an international public-private partnership focusing on building global infrastructure and methodologies to advance the use of RWE for medical device evaluation. CRNs not only focus on prevention of harms but also the promotion of safer device innovation through the development of study designs that expedites patient recruitment at lower costs than traditional clinical research. MDEpiNet developed a maturity model for CRNs with various levels of achievements in seven key domains: 1) device identification, 2) quality improvement, 3) total product life-cycle, 4) data quality, 5) efficiency, 6) governance and sustainability, 7) patient engagement. This proposal focuses on the creation of innovative tools and methods necessary to achieve maturation of the networks through efficient curation of robust RWE. We will capitalize on established partnerships with registries, professional societies, integrated health systems, and many academic institutions to advance this critical national infrastructure as a foundational component of NEST. We will facilitate advancements of RWE through stakeholder roundtables, patient-facing mobile app development, and continued innovative methods development to link registries with Medicare, commercial, statewide, and EHR data to enable better research and surveillance for devices. Our specific aims facilitate stakeholder engagement for device-specific core minimum data development in women's health, prostate cancer, orthopedics, vascular disease, robot-assisted surgery, and temporomandibular joints. We will also advance and enrich linked data capacities in vascular disease, hernia repair, breast implant, prostate cancer, Women's Health, and gastrointestinal cancer CRNs. Finally, we conduct advanced analytics to determine gender disparities in device outcomes and use machine learning and active surveillance methods in hernia repair, orthopedics, stroke treatment, vascular disease, and Women's health CRNs.

"Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation Resuscitation from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is typically initiated in patients with ongoing ischemia and ventricular fibrillation (VF) or tachycardia (VT) that, even if successful, is commonly followed by repeated rearrest. Despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, survival remains poor prompting NIH to identify resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. Beat-to-beat alternans of cellular repolarization in the myocardium (repolarization alternans) is a substrate for arrhythmias, is rampant during resuscitation, and is manifested on the ECG as T-wave oscillations that can alternate (2:1) or as more complex oscillations. In preliminary studies, we observed in resuscitation patients and in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation from SCA, that rearrest due to VT/VF is preceded by T-wave oscillations that are complex; whereas, rearrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is preceded by increased T-wave oscillations that alternate. Accordingly, we contend that when T-wave oscillations are complex, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially discordant, which is repolarization alternans occurring out-of-phase in adjacent regions and is highly arrhythmogenic. In contrast, when T-wave oscillations alternate, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially in-phase (concordant), which poses no known immediate arrhythmia risk but is associated with mechanical dysfunction and, thus, PEA. Finally, in the absence of any repolarization alternans, risk of rearrest due to PEA or VT/VF is low. We hypothesize that during resuscitation rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA is strongly linked to repolarization alternans in the myocardium that is spatially discordant or not, respectively, and that specifically targeting the underlying mechanisms can prevent rearrest due to VT/VF and, possibly, PEA. In addition, the full spectrum of ECG T-wave oscillations can be utilized to predict no rearrest and rearrest from VT/VF or PEA and, thus, be used in the future as a biomarker to guide therapy and significantly improve outcomes. Our hypotheses will be tested with the following aims. 1) Determine the mechanistic relationship between cellular repolarization alternans and rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA in an in vivo model of resuscitation. 2) Determine if targeting the mechanisms of repolarization alternans can prevent rearrest during resuscitation, thereby gaining additional mechanistic insight. 3) Develop and test an ECG biomarker for predicting risk of rearrest due to VT/VF and PEA in resuscitation patients. To achieve these aims, we will utilize sophisticated instrumentation and signal processing in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation as well as in pre-hospital and in- hospital resuscitation patients. We have also established a highly translational collaboration that combines expertise in emergency medicine, cardiac arrhythmia, and clinical electrophysiology. Our scientific environment provides a unique opportunity to develop a better understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms relevant to resuscitation in order to develop novel and effective therapies. Project Narrative Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to arrhythmia is a major public health problem and despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, rearrest and survival remain poor. Consequently, improved approaches are needed, and NIH has recently identified resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. We propose to investigate the mechanisms of rearrest during resuscitation to develop novel and effective therapeutic strategies that improve outcomes.",Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation,10143285,R01HL142754,"['Acute', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency research', 'Environment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitals', 'Ischemia', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Public Health', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'effective therapy', 'epicardial mapping', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'rearrest', 'signal processing', 'therapeutically effective', 'translational model']",NHLBI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,660343
"Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping Summary The use of e-cigarettes or vaping has been steadily increasing since its introduction. While potentially a tool to wean cigarette smokers from combustible tobacco, one consequence of the introduction of these devices has been the adoption of vaping by adolescents. While companies that offer vaping instruments for sale note that their material is directed to adults and intended as an aid for smoking cessation, recent reports have demonstrated that middle school and high school students in many countries, some as young as thirteen, have taken to vaping. Data analysis from a 2015 study in the U.S. indicated that 16% of high school students and 5% of middle school students reported vaping in the past thirty days. Most researchers speculated that the number of users would increase from these baselines and evidence indicates that this prediction is correct. Anecdotal evidence indicates that vaping in middle school and high school bathrooms is a major problem. FreshAir Sensor currently sells tobacco and marijuana smoking sensors along with 24/7 monitoring of the devices. The company has leveraged the knowledge of sensor development to produce preliminary components of an early stage sensing system capable of detecting vaping. Preliminary data to demonstrate this accomplishment is provided. The fast track research described in this proposal will enable the optimization of the sensor as well as commercialization of the resulting instrument in minimal time. The need to reduce and eventually eliminate adolescent vaping is urgent. The deployment of the proposed device in schools and other educational institutions will eliminate vaping during school hours and will, therefore, contribute to improvements in the overall health of adolescents by curtailing nicotine intake. Narrative Vaping has become a problem in schools with students, in steadily increasing numbers, using bathrooms and other less monitored spaces to indulge in the use of the newest vaping hardware. FreshAir Sensor is developing a sensor to detect vaping in otherwise unmonitored spaces. The use of this sensing system has the potential to reduce and, eventually, eliminate vaping behavior in schools, thereby reducing the harmful effects of nicotine in adolescents.",Development/Commercialization of a Sensing Device to Detect Vaping,10187539,R44DA049595,"['Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Chemicals', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Fatigue', 'Film', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Hour', 'Humidity', 'Institution', 'Intake', 'JUUL', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Marijuana', 'Marijuana Smoking', 'Methods', 'Middle School Student', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Neurotoxins', 'Nicotine', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Production', 'Property', 'Public Housing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sales', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Smoking', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'System', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco smoking behavior', 'Weaning', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'commercialization', 'design', 'detection platform', 'detector', 'electronic cigarette use', 'high school', 'instrument', 'junior high school', 'machine learning algorithm', 'monitoring device', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'smoking cessation', 'tool', 'vaping', 'vapor']",NIDA,FRESHAIR SENSOR CORPORATION,R44,2021,399000
"Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications Abstract Our objective in this project is to employ population level pharmacy data and delivery of nudges via cell phone text messaging and artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems (HCS): University of Colorado Health System (UCHealth), VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System (VA), and Denver Health Medical Center (DH). We will identify patients with chronic cardiovascular (CV) conditions taking medications to treat hypertension, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, diabetes and/or hyperlipidemia. We will leverage pharmacy refill data to identify episodes of non-adherence through gaps in medication refills and randomize individuals to 1 of 4 study arms when they have a first refill gap: 1) usual care; 2) generic text message reminder; 3) tailored and engaging text messages optimized to facilitate behavior change; or 4) optimized text messages plus a pre- programmed AI interactive chat bot designed to support identification and resolution of barriers to medication refill and adherence. In the UG3 phase (year 1), we will develop and program a theoretically informed technology-based (a) text message library and (b) chat bot content library using multiple and iterative N of 1 within subject studies to optimize content for a range of diverse patients. These outcomes will inform a pilot intervention to demonstrate feasibility of delivering the intervention and preliminary effects in all 3 HCS. We will also engage patient, provider and health systems stakeholders in designing, refining, and implementing the pilot intervention. In the UH3 phase (years 2-5), we will conduct a pragmatic patient-level randomized intervention across 3 HCS to improve adherence to chronic CV medications. We will evaluate the intervention using a mixed methods approach and apply the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework. In addition, we will assess the context and implementation processes to inform local tailoring, adaptations and modifications, and eventual expansion of the intervention. Project Narrative Given the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases that require ongoing treatment with medications, the problem of medication non-adherence is unlikely to go away and will grow. This study will employ population level pharmacy data to identify non-adherent patients and utilize ubiquitous cell phone technology to send them tailored, engaging and motivating text messages and text message based chat through an artificially intelligent (AI) interactive chat bot to improve cardiac medication adherence and patient outcomes in 3 integrated healthcare delivery systems. This study will advance medication adherence research and the intervention could be applied to multiple clinical conditions requiring medications for long term treatment and other NIH institutes.!",Personalized Patient data and behavioral nudges to improve adherence to chronic cardiovascular medications,10200136,UH3HL144163,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Adherence', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Colorado', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integrated Delivery of Health Care', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Libraries', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Noncompliance', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Self Management', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavioral economics', 'blood pressure regulation', 'chatbot', 'copayment', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'evidence base', 'financial incentive', 'four-arm study', 'health care delivery', 'health care service utilization', 'implementation process', 'improved', 'individual response', 'medication compliance', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'safety net', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'text messaging intervention', 'theories', 'treatment as usual']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,UH3,2021,1417404
"Creating a foundation for personalized age- and sex-based immune-targeted therapies from an ALS longitudinal cohort by identifying peripheral and central immune signatures ABSTRACT The immune system contributes to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) progression and survival, and therapies to target the immune system are of burgeoning interest. However, the changes in the immune system during the course of ALS and the sex-specific alterations in immune function warrant a more in depth analysis in order to develop personalized ALS therapies and biomarkers. The long-term goals are to harness the immune sys- tem’s potential to slow and stop the progression of ALS. The overall objective is to determine how peripheral immune profiles, sex, age, and sex hormones, link to neuronal damage, neuroinflammation, and ALS progres- sion and survival. The central hypothesis is that peripheral immune profiles are an important pathophysiologic agent of ALS progression and survival; that sex, age and sex hormone levels impact these profiles; and that insight into ALS patient-specific immune profiles will yield new drug targets and therapeutic windows. Our ra- tionale is that linking patient-specific immune cell profiles to ALS progression and survival will facilitate person- alized immunomodulatory therapeutic development for ALS and identify potential treatment windows. The cen- tral hypothesis will be pursued with three aims: 1) Identify specific immune profiles that associate with ALS pro- gression and survival rates.; 2) Evaluate the effects of sex hormones on ALS immune profiles, progression, and survival; and 3) Identify immune profiles and corresponding cellular pathways that are most toxic to neu- rons and that associate with central inflammation. In Aim 1 longitudinal immunophenotyping of peripheral blood samples from ALS subjects will generate composite immune profiles that will then be linked to ALS subject characteristics, progression, and survival. Aim 2 will determine if observed sex-dependent associations be- tween immune profiles and ALS progression and survival are mediated by sex hormones, as sex hormones can alter immune profiles. Aim 3 will enrich a cohort of ALS subjects by immune profile clusters; their periph- eral immune populations will be analyzed using 1) RNA-seq and 2) cell toxicity studies via co-cultures with iPSC-derived neurons; subjects will also have positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to quantify central neuroinflammation. Datasets will be synthesized to build prediction models and create deep neural networks capable of associating immune profiles with sex, age, disease severity, progression, and survival The research proposed is innovative, in the applicants’ opinion, because it rigorously examines the effects of sex, age, and sex hormone levels on immune cells and ALS progression and survival in a longitudinal study. It also accounts for the interactions between immune cells by forming immune profiles for individual subjects and assesses how specific profiles associate with dysregulated pathways, cytotoxicity, and neuroinflammation. The proposed re- search is significant because it will provide critical data on the distinct immune profiles and pathways associ- ated with ALS progression and survival in a sex-, age- and sex hormone- specific fashion. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying the alterations in the im- mune system that impact amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and also focuses on identifying whether these altered immune profiles are influenced by sex- and age-specific factors. The development of such strategies will greatly advance the ability to develop personalized treatment approaches for persons with ALS based on immunomodulatory drugs. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to part of the NIH’s mission that pertains to developing the fundamental knowledge about the nervous system and using that knowledge to reduce the bur- den of neurological disease.",Creating a foundation for personalized age- and sex-based immune-targeted therapies from an ALS longitudinal cohort by identifying peripheral and central immune signatures,10177640,R01NS120926,"['ALS patients', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Estrogens', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Mediating', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Motor Neuron Disease', 'Natural Killer Cells', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostitution', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testosterone', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Tweens', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis therapy', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'cytotoxicity', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'effective therapy', 'immune function', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotoxicity', 'neutrophil', 'new therapeutic target', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'predictive modeling', 'sex', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,643473
"Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis Project Summary  The candidate requests support for a four-year program of training and research to better understand how smartphone based digital phenotyping and computational methods can predict relapse and create digital phenotypes of symptoms and clinical outcomes in early course psychosis.  In the proposed training plan, the candidate will build upon his previous experiences in engineering, clinical informatics, and clinical psychiatry to perform a multidisciplinary project at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. His training plan includes training in: 1) statistical methods for multivariate longitudinal analysis and predictive inference 2) the neuropsychiatric assessment of schizophrenia 3) longitudinal clinical research methodology with a focus on mobile technologies, and 4) the responsible conduct of research.  Even with appropriate care, relapse is common in early course psychosis and each episode is associated higher costs of care, poorer lifetime outcomes, and chronicity of the disease. There is a need to learn more about the personal factors associated with relapse for individual patients in order to improve risk predictions, ensure appropriate early interventions, and support coordinated specialty care services for schizophrenia. This study proposes that smartphones sensors eg (GPS, accelerometer), wearable devices like smartwatches collecting physiology, and smartphone based surveys and cognitive tests, when combined with appropriate statistical methods, can capture digital biomarkers, refereed to here as digital phenotypes, of early course psychosis that can offer personalized relapse prediction and augment population level risk factors.  This candidate's research plan seeks to: 1) propose digital phenotypes and relapse models of early course psychosis captured in an affordable and scalable manner from subject's personal smartphones as well as a wearable sensor in order to automatically collect self-report of symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology 2) and evaluate the accuracy of digital phenotypes and the relapse prediction models.  This study proposes to address this hypothesis by utilizing smartphone based digital phenotyping methods, primarily through running the Beiwe app on subjects' own smartphones, to capture longitudinal data on symptoms, behaviors, cognition, and physiology across subjects' natural environments. These studies will be performed across 3.5 years in subjects with early course psychosis and range between 6 to 12 months.  The broader aim of this research is to understand the systems and processes, both personal and environmental, which contribute to relapse in early course psychosis. An understanding of the computational basis of relapse will inform better nosology, allow development of biomarkers of illness that may offer better targets for biological research, inform development of personalized interventions for psychotic illnesses, and help support early interventions for schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling disorder that is characterized by episodes of relapse, and  is thought to impact ~1.5% of the population.  Our current treatments and ability to predict  relapse early are limited by our understanding of the longitudinal course, environmental factors,  and variability of clinical presentation. This study seeks to model this complexity using  computational methods and digital phenotyping so that we may design more effective early  interventions for this disease.",Digital Phenotyping for Computational Models of Relapse Prediction in Early Course Psychosis,10133145,K23MH116130,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Israel', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Ownership', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Quality of life', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Cost', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'biomarker development', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive testing', 'computational basis', 'cost effective', 'data modeling', 'design', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'economic cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fitbit', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'longitudinal analysis', 'longitudinal course', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotoxic', 'open source', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'responsible research conduct', 'risk prediction', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'smart watch', 'social', 'tool', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2021,191000
"NBER Center for Aging and Health Research OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract Lessons for COVID-19 from the Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918 to 1920 There is currently great concern about the health consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. One issue is how non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions (NPIs) impact the spread of the disease and, hence, fatality rates. A second is the inequality in infection rates and deaths across people with different socioeconomic characteristics. The goal of this project is to draw lessons for today from the Great Influenza Pandemic, which began in spring 1918, peaked during a second wave in late 1918 and early 1919, persisted through 1920, and cumulatively killed 40 million people worldwide. Using a combination of cross-city and cross-national analyses, the project will study how disease outcomes from the Great Influenza Pandemic relate to variations in population demographics and patterns of NPI use. The project will assess how disease outcomes relate to the types and durations of non-pharmaceutical public-health interventions implemented across geographic locations and over time. It will characterize the NPIs that were adopted during the Great Influenza Pandemic in terms of type, intensity, and duration of application. Among the NPIs to be considered are school closings, prohibitions of public gatherings, and quarantine/isolation. The project will analyze variations in infections, deaths, population demographics, and NPI use across at least 45 large US cities, 48 countries, and cities in Spain and England, where high-frequency data are available on flu-related excess mortality. The project will be conducted as a supplement to grant P30-AG012810, the NBER Center for Aging and Health Research.

"Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods Implantable medical devices have revolutionized contemporary cardiovascular care, and are used in a wide spectrum of acute and chronic cardiovascular conditions. However, medical device design fault or incorrect use may lead to significant risk of patient injury and represents an important preventable public health risk in the United States. To help identify device-related safety issues, a strategy of active, prospective, post-market safety surveillance has been recommended by the FDA, and evaluated methodologically. This type of surveillance offers significant advantages over traditional adverse event reporting strategies. However, all such approaches are challenged by the need to incorporate learning effects into expectations regarding safety. These learning impacts been repeatedly shown to have dramatic impacts on outcomes during early device experience. Quantifying learning effects on the outcomes associated with high-risk cardiovascular devices will improve our understanding of intrinsic device performance, thereby identifying patient populations best treated with such devices while simultaneously providing necessary feedback to device manufacturers to support iterative improvement in device design. Separately, understanding the impacts of learning may identify opportunities for targeted training as well as help to tease apart institutional and operator characteristics that may accelerate the achievement of optimal outcomes in the use of the specific cardiovascular device.  This proposal seeks to extend the previously validated, open-source, active, prospective device safety surveillance tool, by developing and validating robust learning curve (LC) detection and quantification algorithms, designed to simultaneously account for the effects at the operator and institutional levels. We propose a “blinded” development strategy, in which one team will generate robust synthetic clinical data simulator with LC impacts, and the other team develops and applies LC detection and quantification algorithms, without knowledge of the underlying relationships, determine performance and accuracy through sequential refinement and validation steps. We propose to formally validate the optimized LC tools in real-world data through re-analysis of previously published LC effects on transcatheter valves and vascular closure devices using national cardiovascular registries. In addition, the LC tools will be incorporated into two active, prospective device safety surveillance studies of novel implantable cardiovascular devices using large clinical registries. This proposal seeks to understand the impact of institutional and physician learning on the safety of newly approved cardiovascular devices, and to use this knowledge to support and improve effective medical device safety surveillance. We propose a “blinded” strategy of separating simulated dataset generation from the learning effects detection and quantification algorithm development. Incorporating learning effects adjustment into a validated, prospective, near-real-time safety surveillance system, this research will improve public health by identifying poorer performing cardiovascular devices, and provide physicians, device manufacturers and public health officials with better information to optimize the use of medical devices, iteratively improve their design, and identify opportunities for enhanced training that will result in improved patient outcomes.",Incorporating Learning Effects into Medical Device Active Safety Surveillance Methods,10088471,R01HL149948,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Device Safety', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Implant', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Medical Device Safety', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surveillance Methods', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'design', 'expectation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'post-market', 'prospective', 'safety outcomes', 'simulation', 'surveillance strategy', 'surveillance study', 'systems research', 'tool']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,768996
"Digital Melt Curve Analysis Platform for Longitudinal Cancer Patient Monitoring Abstract  Building on its commercially available Absolute Q digital PCR platform, during the 24-month Phase 2 SBIR project, Combinati will complete the development of the first Digital Melt Curve Analysis (DMCA) platform to the market to further advance the adoption of digital genomics for highly accurate, sensitive and reproducible nucleic acid quantification for longitudinal patient monitoring. To provide the “whole product” solution and prove the function, we will demonstrate the DMCA platform with Luminex’s 11- plex ESR1 (Estrogen Receptor 1) assay and conduct Beta testing at Dana Farber Cancer Institute: 1. Three beta instruments and the analysis software capable of digital melt curve analysis. 2. Complete dMCA validation internally with commercially available melt calibration kits. 3. Demonstrate <0.1% Mutation Allele Frequency of 11 cell-free DNA targets using Luminex  Corporation’s discrete melt assay. 4. Beta testing at Dana Farber Cancer Institute Narrative  Since PCR was invented back in 1983, it has become the gold standard for applications requiring quantification of nucleic acids. The continuous evolution of the technology enables PCR to be more quantitative (qPCR), more accurate, precise and reproducible (digital PCR).

"Novel Designs and Methods to Remove Hidden Confounding Bias in Health Sciences Abstract A major approach in causal inference literature aimed at mitigating bias due to unmeasured confounding is the so- called instrumental variable (IV) design which relies on identifying a variable which (i) influences the treatment process, (ii) has no direct effect on the outcome other than through the treatment, and (iii) is independent of any unmeasured confounder. IV methods are very well developed and widely used in social and health science, although validity of IV inferences may not be reliable if any of required assumptions (i)-(iii) is violated. This proposal aims to develop (a) new IV methods robust to violation of any of (i)-(iii); (b) New negative control methods that can be used to detect and sometimes to nonparametrically account for unmeasured confounding bias; (c) New bracketing methods for partial inference about causal effects in comparative interrupted time series studies. The proposed methods will be used to address current scientific queries in three major substantive public health areas:(1) to understand the health effects of air pollution; (2) to quantify the causal effects of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and related disorders; (3) To uncover the mechanism by which a randomized package of interventions produced a substantial reduction of HIV incidence in a recent major cluster randomized trial of treatment as prevention in Botswana, Africa. Our proposal will provide the best available analytical methods to date to resolve confounding concerns in these high impact public health applications and more broadly in observational studies in the health sciences. Summary This proposal aims to develop new causal inference methods to tame bias due to hidden confounding factors in obser- vational studies as well as in randomized experiments subject to non-adherence. The proposed methods are firmly grounded in modern semiparametric theory which will be used to obtain more robust and efficient inferences about causal effects in a broad range of public health applications including in Epidemiology of Aging, Environmental Health Epidemiology and HIV/AIDS Prevention.",Novel Designs and Methods to Remove Hidden Confounding Bias in Health Sciences,10159821,R01AG065276,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Africa', 'Aging', 'Air Pollution', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Botswana', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Genetic', 'HIV', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Incidence', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Applications Research', 'Randomized', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Thromboplastin', 'Time', 'ambient air pollution', 'analytical method', 'c new', 'comparative', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'intervention effect', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pleiotropism', 'semiparametric', 'simulation', 'theories', 'treatment as prevention', 'treatment effect', 'uptake', 'user friendly software']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,468961
"Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout Gout is a highly prevalent, painful inflammatory arthritis, caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Gout flares cause impaired quality of life and physical function, leading to lost work days, disability, high healthcare costs. Patients with gout are also known to be at an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), kidney disease, and mortality. Previous studies suggest a potential beneficial effect of urate-lowering therapy on the risk of CVD and renal function. Over the past decade, the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid (SUA) level below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, based on the upper limit of water solubility of uric acid under normal physiologic circumstances. However, the 2016 American College of Physicians (ACP)’ guidelines for gout management recommend use of urate-lowering therapy but support a ‘treat-to-avoid symptoms’ strategy without monitoring SUA rather than the TTT strategy because of ‘inconclusive’ evidence in the literature. Such discrepancies in treatment guidelines from various societies urge the need for comparative effectiveness research of the treatment strategies for gout.  Rigorous epidemiologic studies utilizing high-quality observational data from electronic health records (EHR) or insurance claims databases can be an important tool for comparative effectiveness research. The primary objective of this 3-year proposal is to provide high-quality, timely evidence on the comparative effectiveness of two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of gout. We will pursue this objective by utilizing the linked Partners’ EHR-Medicare database (2007-2016); this linked database includes all patients aged ≥65 years enrolled in Medicare Parts A/B/D who had ≥1 encounter at one of the Partners Healthcare hospitals. We will have longitudinal, clinically important data on patients’ demographics, body mass index, visit notes, laboratory results including SUA and serum creatinine, as well as all Medicare claims for inpatient and outpatient visits, procedures, and prescription drugs. The two specific aims of this 3-year proposal are: 1) to examine the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of gout flares versus usual care and 2) to assess the effect of TTT strategy on the risk of kidney disease and CVD versus usual care.  Given the substantial prevalence of gout, the suboptimal management of gout and lack of comparative trial of different treatment strategies, this proposed study will make an immediate, important contribution to the management of gout in clinical practice. This work will not only investigate the effects of different treatment strategies on gout flares but also on common comorbidities in patients with gout such as kidney and CVD. Furthermore, this proposed study will advance understanding of how to improve ascertainment of dynamic outcomes and control for time-varying confounding by utilizing sophisticated and innovative epidemiologic as well as bioinformatics methods in a large EHR database linked with Medicare claims. Narrative Gout is a common, painful inflammatory arthritis caused by crystallization of uric acid in joint tissues. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat, are the mainstay of urate-lowering treatment for gout. While rheumatology societies recommend a treat-to-target (TTT) approach that lowers serum uric acid below 6 mg/dl to reduce acute gout attacks, there is currently no clinical data whether TTT approach is better than urate- lowering therapy but no regular monitoring of uric acid levels (i.e., usual care); therefore, this 3-year research proposal examines the comparative effectiveness of the two different treatment strategies, TTT versus usual care, for management of chronic gout in a real-world setting.",Comparative Effectiveness of Treat-To-Target Approach versus Routine Care in Management of Gout,10176417,R01AR073314,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allopurinol', 'American', 'American College of Physicians', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'European', 'Flare', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'High Prevalence', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Impairment', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical Societies', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part A', 'Medicare claim', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physical Function', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Research Proposals', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Symptoms', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Urate', 'Uric Acid', 'Visit', 'Work', 'active comparator', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative trial', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'efficacy study', 'electronic data', 'epidemiology study', 'febuxostat', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'population based', 'rheumatologist', 'routine care', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment guidelines', 'treatment strategy', 'water solubility', 'xanthine oxidase inhibitor']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,407634
"Developing Computational Methods for Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistant Agents PROJECT ABSTRACT  Antimicrobial resistance is a critical public health issue. Infections with drug resistant pathogens are estimated to cause an additional eight million hospitalization days annually over the hospitalizations that would be seen for infections with susceptible agents. The use of antibiotics (in both clinical and agricultural settings) is being viewed as precursor for these infections and thus, is a major public health concern—particularly as outbreaks become more frequent and severe. However, scientiﬁc evidence describing the hazards associated with antibiotic use is lacking due to inability to quantify the risk of these practices. One promising avenue to elucidate this risk is to use shotgun metagenomics to identify the AMR genes in samples taken through systematic spatiotemporal surveillance. The goal of this proposed work is to develop algorithms that will provide such a means for analysis. The algorithms need to be scalable to very large datasets and thus, will require the development and use succinct data structures.  In order to achieve this goal, the investigative team will develop the theoretical foundations and applied meth- ods needed to study AMR through the use of shotgun metagenomics. A major focus of the proposed work is developing algorithms that can handle very large datasets. To achieve this scalability, we will create novel means to create, compress, reconstruct and update very large de Bruijn graphs that metagenomics data in a manner needed to study AMR. In addition, we will pioneer the study of AMR through long read data by proposing new algorithmic problems and solutions that use data. For example, identifying the location of speciﬁc genes in a metagenomics sample using long read data has not been proposed or studied. Thus, the algorithmic ideas and techniques developed in this project will not only advance the study of AMR, but contribute to the growing domain of big data analysis and pan-genomics.  Lastly, we plan to apply our methods to samples collected from both agricultural and clinical settings in Florida. Analysis of preliminary and new data will allow us to conclude about (1) the public risk associated with antimicro- bial use in agriculture; (2) the effectiveness of interventions used to reduce resistant bacteria, and lastly, (3) the factors that allow resistant bacteria to grow, thrive and evolve. A–1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  Antibiotic use in agriculture is a major public health concern that is receiving a lot of media attention, par- ticularly as antibiotic-resistant infections in become more frequent and severe. This research will build a novel bioinformatics framework for determining how antimicrobial resistant genes evolve, grow, and persist in a system that has been affected by antibiotic use. This will, in turn, facilitate the development of effective intervention methods that reduce resistant pathogens in clinical and agricultural settings.

"Personalized 3D avatar tool development for measurement of body perception across gender identities Abstract Public awareness of the diversity of experiences of gender identities has climbed sharply. The specific issues of those with gender dysphoria (GD) related to self-identity, body image, and medical interventions are challenges for the 21st century, particularly given the high risk of suicide. Gender identity is tightly linked to one’s bodily features, particularly readily observable sexual characteristics. For transgender and nonbinary individuals with GD, the incongruence between their body associated with their birth-assigned sex – what they see in the mirror before any treatment – and the internalized representation of their gender-identified body is a key defining part of their experience and contributes to their dysphoria. Currently, no clinical or research tool exists to capture and quantify the diverse experiences of one’s current body and one’s gender-identified body (which may be distinct from their current body), across a range of gender identities. Measuring the internalized representation of one’s body could be facilitated by technology to visually represent this on a three-dimensional avatar. The technology needed to scan and analyze the human figure is now available and cost efficient. It is now possible to scan individuals to create personalized 3D visualizations, or “avatars,” with which they can interact on mobile and desktop devices to represent internal representation of their bodies. This can allow individuals to see and manipulate their own 3D avatar with a high degree of flexibility. The goal of this project is to create a novel, visually based digital tool to measure, understand, and quantify individuals’ experiences of their bodies. We will develop, validate, and test in transgender, nonbinary, and cisgender adults a personalized avatar tool to represent internalized gender-identified bodies in order to quantify incongruence between this and one’s current body. This tool – “GD Somatomap” – will be an advancement over existing self-report questionnaires to capture visual representations of internalized body image, cross-sectionally and dynamically over time. It will be flexible enough to characterize the heterogenous experiences of a range of gender identities including binary transgender, gender fluid, nonbinary, and cisgender. It can be used in clinical and clinical research applications to track outcomes of cross-hormone and gender-affirming surgical treatments. It can potentially improve clinical outcomes by identifying specific sets of body parts as targets for treatments to improve body congruence. Further, it will provide a unique means to measure own-body perceptual accuracy; understanding differences in perceptual accuracy and what potentially modifiable factors contribute to this may have prognostic significance for treatments to address body incongruence. It could also be used in future studies to investigate functional and structural neurobiological correlates of body perception and internal body representation, and at what point in neurodevelopment these emerge for those with different gender identities. PROJECT NARRATIVE The internalized, conscious experience of one’s body is not easily communicated, much less measured and quantified. This is especially relevant for those with gender dysphoria, whose internal, gender-identified body representation is incongruent with their current body. We will develop and test an innovative technological solution, making use of 3D image reconstruction and advanced 3D modeling, to create personalized avatars to measure body incongruence for research and clinical applications in those with gender dysphoria.",Personalized 3D avatar tool development for measurement of body perception across gender identities,10111313,R21EB030851,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Birth', 'Body Image', 'Body measure procedure', 'Body part', 'Breast', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Distress', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gender Identity', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Grouping', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Human body', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physical shape', 'Problem Solving', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Waist-Hip Ratio', 'base', 'body dissatisfaction', 'cisgender', 'clinical application', 'cost efficient', 'digital', 'dysphoria', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'gender dysphoria', 'gender fluid', 'high risk', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'prognostic significance', 'sex', 'suicidal risk', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'three-dimensional visualization', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transgender', 'unsupervised learning']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,203647
"High Throughput Screen and High Information Follow-Up Tests for Genotoxicants Project Summary  Current batteries of genetic toxicology assays exhibit several critical deficiencies. First, the throughput capacity of in vitro genotoxicity tests is low, and does not meet current needs, especially for early, high volume screening environments that need to prioritize chemicals for further testing and/or development. Second, conventional assays provide simplistic binary calls, genotoxic or non-genotoxic. In this scheme there is little or no information provided about genotoxic mode of action. This is severely limiting, as it does not generate key information necessary for prioritizing chemicals for further testing, guiding subsequent assays’ endpoints/experimental designs, or conducting risk assessments. Finally, most current assays do not place requisite emphasis on dose response relationships, and therefore do not contextualize the results in terms of potency. These deficiencies prevent genotoxicity data from optimally contributing to modern risk assessments, where all of these capabilities and high information content are essential. We will solve these issues by developing, optimizing, and validating a two-tiered testing strategy based on multiplexed DNA damage responsive biomarkers and high-speed flow cytometric analysis. The first-tier focuses on throughput and is used to prioritize likely genotoxicants for more comprehensive analysis in second tier testing. Specifically, it involves a collection of several multiplexed biomarkers that will be used to identify likely genotoxic agents and provide a preliminary assessment of genotoxic mode of action. The gH2AX biomarker detects DNA double strand breaks, phospho-histone H3 identifies mitotic cells, nuclear p53 content reports on p53 activation in response to DNA damage, the frequency of 8n+ cells measure polyploidization, and the ratio of nuclei to microsphere counts provides information about treatment-related cytotoxicity. The second tier focuses on information content and considers many more concentrations as well as additional biomarkers, including micronucleus formation. Collectively, the tier two results provide definitive predictions about test chemicals’ genotoxic potential, mode of action, and potency. Over the course of this project we will study more than 3,000 diverse chemicals in order to understand the performance characteristics and generalizability of the two-tiered testing strategy. An interlaboratory trial will be conducted with prototype assay kits to assess the transferability of the methods, with the ultimate goal of providing the Nation with commercially available kits and testing services. Project Narrative Some chemicals in commercial use and in the environment can cause DNA damage and this damage can contribute to the development of cancer and other severe diseases. We will develop, optimize, and validate an improved testing strategy based on highly automated processes tracking several DNA damage biomarkers that can be analyzed without the need for animal testing. These methods will be configured into commercially available kits and testing services.",High Throughput Screen and High Information Follow-Up Tests for Genotoxicants,10255405,R44ES033138,"['Address', 'Animal Testing', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Buffers', 'Canada', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Collection', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Double Strand Break', 'DNA Repair', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'End Point Assay', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Formulation', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histone H3', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Industry', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Activation', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Miniaturization', 'Mitotic', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens', 'National Toxicology Program', 'Nuclear', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Reagent', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Speed', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicogenetics', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'cell type', 'climate change', 'computerized tools', 'cytotoxicity', 'design', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'genotoxicity', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'micronucleus', 'phosphatase inhibitor', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'screening', 'testing services']",NIEHS,"LITRON LABORATORIES, LTD.",R44,2021,204743
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,10132378,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'provider behavior', 'side effect', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,143581
"Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data PROJECT SUMMARY This study will leverage large-scale clinical data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to identify existing pharmaceutical agents commonly prescribed for a multitude of indications that are incidentally associated with improvements in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Through prior efforts, a data source containing almost 20 years of treatment data on all (over one million) VA users diagnosed with PTSD between October 1999 and February 2018 has been constructed, including a complete historical record of their evidence-based medication and psychotherapy receipt within the VA healthcare system. Importantly, the team has also amassed symptom-level patient-reported PTSD outcome data for hundreds of thousands of these patients. The existing data is a powerful resource with which the research team proposes to explore the following specific aims: (1) identify off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms over time; (2) further evaluate the clinical effectiveness of newly-identified off-label pharmaceutical agents for improvement in PTSD symptoms using rigorous causal methods; and (3) identify common adverse events related to off-label pharmaceutical agents associated with improvements in PTSD symptoms in this complex, psychiatrically and medically ill population The proposed project will identify agents that may merit further rigorous clinical evaluation for psychiatric benefit. New therapeutic targets may be identified that will lead to greater treatment options or specific treatments. Further, identification of off-label medications that improve or have contraindicated effects for psychiatric populations will provide critical guidance to practicing clinicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, there are few psychopharmacologic treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and available medications do not work sufficiently. In a recent published statement, NIMH noted that “The National Institute of Mental Health would relish the chance to partner with our VA colleagues to exploit [VA data] with the aim of providing guidelines for evidence-based pharmacotherapy for those suffering from PTSD, Veterans and civilians alike.” The proposed study was specifically designed in response to that call; it will use exploratory methods to identify off-label medications that are effective for the treatment of PTSD using a large VA medical records-based dataset.",Identification of Novel Agents to Treat PTSD using Clinical Data,10150094,R01MH121397,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Biological Psychiatry', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Fluoxetine', 'Future', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Label', 'Leadership', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Paroxetine', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Scanning', 'Sertraline', 'Severities', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Trees', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Veterans', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'data resource', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'military veteran', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label drug', 'prospective', 'psychopharmacologic', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy development', 'treatment guidelines', 'venlafaxine', 'working group']",NIMH,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2021,554790
"WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild Project Summary Behavioral interventions for weight loss include self-monitoring and self-report of diet. However, few people adhere to self-monitoring because they believe it will be a burden. For those who do adhere, biased reporting leads to poor accuracy. Self-report measures have helped us understand contextual factors of problematic eating behaviors, but we cannot validate such relationships to dietary intake and weight because of unreliable reporting. Therefore, we need an objective way to validate self-report measures. Automated self-monitoring, however, can lead to high eating false alarm detection rates (calling something eating when it is not eating). It also requires participants to push buttons during the start and end of a meal. Passive and unobtrusive ways to capture images of food intake would improve accuracy of detection, avoid the need for a person to remember what they ate, and limit bias based on what participants believe to be socially desirable. Such methods could also ease the self-monitoring burden, decrease errors associated with self- report measures, and lay the foundation for understanding when and how problematic eating behaviors occur. Image capture using wearable cameras may help us better understand obesity and its context (that is, the situation in which eating occurs). However, privacy and ethical concerns of bystanders whose images are taken are a significant barrier. Currently there is no privacy-preserving camera that participants are both willing to wear and that provides meaningful information on food intake and context associated with problematic eating behaviors. Several methods exist, known as obfuscation, that can filter unnecessary information in the scene. However, we do not know which method is most acceptable to a person wearing the device in everyday life that would encourage greatest wear-time. Our project aims to determine which method is best for preserving privacy while providing enough information to understand eating behaviors and their context. To do this, we will observe participants in their everyday life, with special attention to eating behaviors. We will use these new image capture techniques to help understand eating behaviors associated with obesity. First, we will select the best obfuscation method by testing the most well-known obfuscation methods in a cross-over trial to identify which method has the greatest participant acceptability and feasibility (compared with no obfuscation). We will test a novel wearable camera with an infrared sensor (allows us to determine objects that are near vs. far in the camera) with 3 obfuscation methods in real-world settings, including a cartooning gaming–based method. We will then select the obfuscation method that increases wear time and design an eating algorithm around it. Using this algorithm we will assess our ability to capture behaviorally meaningful context from the obfuscated image, such as whether people are eating alone or not, at home, using screen time, and eating prepared or cooked food. This will improve current research practices of evaluating dietary intake and pave the way for personalized interventions in behavioral medicine. Project Narrative Obesity treatment would benefit greatly from an accurate understanding of problematic eating behaviors in real-world settings. Wearable video cameras provide significant utility in understanding eating behaviors, yet pose a major privacy concern in the real-world, significantly impacting longitudinal wear time. We are testing a privacy-conscious wearable device that individuals with obesity will wear and that can accurately detect eating, which will advance our understanding of behavioral phenotypes surrounding obesity, laying the foundation for future interventions to change problematic eating behaviors.",WildCam: A Privacy Conscious Wearable Eating Detection Camera People will Actually Wear in the Wild,10109884,R03DK127128,"['Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Cartoons', 'Chest', 'Clinical Research', 'Conscious', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Energy Intake', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food', 'Food Patterns', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Magnetism', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Periodicity', 'Persons', 'Population Research', 'Privacy', 'Privatization', 'Reading', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Secure', 'Social Desirability', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Video Recording', 'Visual', 'Weight', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'adult obesity', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'contextual factors', 'cooking', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'experience', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'food consumption', 'improved', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized intervention', 'preservation', 'privacy preservation', 'sensor', 'tv watching', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'weight loss intervention', 'willingness']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R03,2021,116737
"Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Chronic wounds affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States. Current standard protocols for wound management do not guarantee healing and focus on maintaining a wound environment that is conducive to passive self-healing. Hence, there is a need to develop alternative treatments that promote active healing and shorten healing time leading to reduced costs. We have previously reported that treatment with low-frequency (20-100 kHz), low-intensity (50-150 mW/cm2) ultrasound (LFLI US) significantly (p<0.03) reduces venous ulcer size in vivo as compared to wounds treated with a sham device. This proposal aims at determining the biological mechanisms by which LFLI US promotes chronic wound healing in vitro. There is evidence that the cause of impaired healing is the dysregulation of macrophage phenotype, especially the defective transition from pro- inflammatory (M1) to pro-healing (M2) macrophages. Our characterization of tissue debrided from chronic wounds has shown that healing chronic wounds contain higher proportions of M1-like than M2- like macrophages. Additionally, the signaling protein Rac2, downstream of integrin and focal adhesion kinase activation, is a key regulator of mechanotransduction in macrophages and facilitates the transition of macrophages from the M1 to M2 phenotype. The proposed study will systematically examine the effects of LFLI ultrasound on macrophage phenotype, using macrophages cultured in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds. We hypothesize that LFLI US directly and indirectly stimulates the transition of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages to pro-healing M2 macrophages via Rac2. This project will enhance our understanding of chronic wound healing and the potential of therapeutic ultrasound to accelerate healing. Aim 1 will elucidate the direct effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype by treating inflammatory macrophages directly with LFLI US and characterizing functional changes (proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis), protein/cytokine secretion, and gene expression. Concurrently, we will validate Rac2 as the potential mechanotransduction pathway which promotes M1 to M2 macrophages transition by analyzing integrins, focal adhesion kinases, and Rac2 via confocal microscopy and RNA characterization. [Aim 2 will validate the in vitro findings from Aim 1 using our previously developed diagnostic M1/M2 score on debrided tissue from chronic wound patients treated with LFLI US.] Aim 3 will elucidate the indirect effects of LFLI US on macrophage function and phenotype via a 3D macrophage fibroblast co-culture. The results of this study will inform the optimal design of LFLI ultrasound therapy protocols, lead to a personalized, active treatment for chronic wounds, accelerate chronic wound healing, and contribute to reduced annual wound care costs. Project Narrative Chronic wounds currently affect approximately 6.5 million patients in the United States and an excess of 25 billion dollars is spent annually on treatment. Current standards of care for chronic wounds, including months of weekly re-dressings and debridement, fails to guarantee active wound healing or closure. To address this issue, we propose to determine the biological mechanism responsible for therapeutic ultrasound mediated healing, low-intensity (<100mW/cm2), low-frequency (20kHz) ultrasound that has been shown to accelerate chronic wound closure in pilot clinical studies.","Macrophage Phenotype Transition as the Biological Mechanism of Chronic Wound Healing Treated with Non-Thermal, Non-Cavitational Therapeutic Ultrasound",10137782,F31AR074847,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Care', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Debridement', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fibroblasts', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impaired healing', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Integrins', 'Lead', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phagocytosis', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Prunella vulgaris', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Signaling Protein', 'Source', 'Sterile coverings', 'Stimulus', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonic Therapy', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Varicose Ulcer', 'active method', 'alternative treatment', 'angiogenesis', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'care costs', 'cell type', 'chronic wound', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'diabetic ulcer', 'healing', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'knock-down', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'mechanotransduction', 'migration', 'rac2 GTP-binding protein', 'scaffold', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'wound', 'wound care', 'wound closure', 'wound environment', 'wound healing', 'wound treatment']",NIAMS,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,46036
"Quantitative and Spectroscopic Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Changes in Sarcopenia at High Field Project Summary Sarcopenia, a condition characterized by loss of muscle mass and function in the elderly, is of increasing relevance in the United States due to its aging population. It is generally agreed that the weakening of the muscle in sarcopenia cannot be explained by loss of muscle mass alone, but the mechanisms behind this remain poorly understood. This is partly due to the lack of non-invasive techniques for observing muscle structure and composition in high detail. We propose to develop MRI techniques to measure muscle morphology, microstructure, and fat content to get a detailed view of the changes in muscle quantity and quality in patients with sarcopenia and how they relate to more easily attainable measurements of muscle function such as grip strength and gait speed. This would provide an important contribution to the ongoing debate about how such measurements could be used to define sarcopenia, which would pave the way for treatment development. We aim to develop novel methods to investigate the structure and composition of muscle using ultra-high-field MRI. Specifically, we aim to (1) obtain water-based images of skeletal muscle macro- and microstructure with unparalleled efficiency, image quality, and resolution; (2) obtain images of the spatial distribution of intramyocellular lipids in skeletal muscle, measuring both methyl and methylene to estimate saturation; and (3) to conduct a study comparing skeletal muscle structure and quality by looking at MR measurements of T2 relaxation rates, diffusivity (as proxies for inflammation and fiber size, respectively), fat fraction, and lipid composition, in subjects with sarcopenia and healthy controls and see how these quantities correlate to muscle function. This project has several innovative aspects. First, we will develop a method to estimate muscle morphology, T2 relaxation rates, and diffusivity with a single MRI sequence. Importantly, this will make the developed method easy to run at other MRI sites. Second, we will devise methods to perform robust, efficient imaging of intramyocellular lipid droplet distribution and saturation in human skeletal muscle in vivo at high field. Both of these methods will have unparalleled signal-to-noise ratio and robustness against image artifacts. The significance of this work is the investigation of the role of inflammation, fiber size, and lipid distribution in the weakening of muscle in sarcopenia and how these measurements are related to muscle function. The resulting conclusions and techniques may help establish a common standard for the definition of sarcopenia and aid in the development of future treatments for this condition. Project Narrative Sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and function with age, is a condition bound to increase in prevalence with an aging population. The muscle changes involved include not only reduction in mass but also changes in muscle quality not easily visualized with current methods. This work aims to develop efficient MRI techniques to investigate these changes in better detail, improving scientific understanding of the mechanisms of sarcopenia and how they relate to muscle function.",Quantitative and Spectroscopic Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Changes in Sarcopenia at High Field,10125507,K99AG066815,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gait speed', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Hand Strength', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Protons', 'Proxy', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Soleus Muscle', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Water', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'carbene', 'clinical biomarkers', 'design', 'falls', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'quantitative imaging', 'radio frequency', 'recruit', 'sarcopenia', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'therapy development']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2021,114480
"Diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children PROJECT SUMMARY The recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and resultant pandemic of COVID-19 disease has overwhelmed global health systems and led to over 200,000 American deaths to date. While initial reports suggested that SARS- CoV-2 infection in children was generally benign, a novel post-inflammatory syndrome known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has now been described. MIS-C in children is characterized by fever, systemic inflammation, and end-organ involvement, and the majority of patients are IgG seropositive for SARS- CoV-2. Because the clinical features of MIS-C overlap with other infections and inflammatory disorders, new strategies for diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children are urgently needed. Our immediate objective (during the R61 phase) is to determine the reproducible changes in breath, urine, and salivary volatile composition in chil- dren diagnosed with MIS-C. We will integrate these discovery studies with clinical and immunological profiling to develop (during R61 phase) and validate (during R33 phase) a novel and much-needed MIS-C diagnostic, which is expected to have a major impact on care of febrile children. Our long-term goal to develop a diagnostic strategy to distinguish children with MIS-C from children with other causes of fever. Supported by our strong preliminary data that indicate our expertise and feasibility of this strategy, our objectives will be met through three specific aims: 1) Characterize breath biomarkers in children with MIS-C (R61); 2) Relate breath VOC changes to virolog- ical, disease severity, and immunological features of MIS-C (R61); and 3) Validate our novel MIS-C diagnostic for clinical use (R33). The proposed research is significant, because we will progress in development of new, much-needed MIS-C rapid diagnostic tool. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research is highly relevant to public health because there is no current validated diagnostic tool for the post-SARS-CoV-2 inflammatory disorder in children, MIS-C. Our proposal will develop a new strategy to diagnose this disorder, which will directly improve care of children with fever and help support future clinical studies.",Diagnosis of MIS-C in febrile children,10272856,R61HD105594,"['2019-nCoV', 'Academy', 'Acute', 'Adult', 'American', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Canis familiaris', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Virology', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Fever', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Immune', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Work', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical epidemiology', 'coronavirus disease', 'global health', 'improved', 'member', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'respiratory', 'response', 'seropositive', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tool', 'translational study', 'validation studies', 'virology', 'volatile organic compound']",NICHD,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R61,2021,879259
"Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training 2.0 (AR3T 2.0) OVERALL: ABSTRACT  The scope of regenerative medicine encompasses the repair, regeneration, and replacement of defective, injured, and diseased tissues and organs. The success of regenerative therapies is dependent, at least in part, on a favorable microenvironment in which the regenerative processes occur. Technological innovations and a deepened mechanistic understanding of how these microenvironmental signals influence tissue regeneration has drawn attention to the critical importance of the clinical field with foundations in the application of physical, thermal, and electrical stimuli to promote functional restoration—rehabilitation. We propose that the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitative science are inextricably intertwined, an intersection of disciplines that we and others have termed Regenerative Rehabilitation. To realize the full potential of Regenerative Rehabilitation, there is a need for formalized mechanisms that promote the interaction of basic scientists with rehabilitation specialists. During the initial funding cycle, the Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training (AR3T) built a national network of investigators and programs that has helped to expand scientific knowledge, expertise and methodologies across the domains of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation. This proposal seeks funding for AR3T 2.0, in which we will build on successes achieved and lessons learned over the initial period of support with the goal of being even more responsive to the needs of the greater community. Six specific aims define a framework upon which we will achieve our goals. AR3T will provide education and drive the science underlying Regenerative Rehabilitation by: 1) Providing didactic programs that expose rehabilitation researchers to cutting-edge investigations and state-of-the-art technologies in the field of regenerative medicine (Didactic Aim); 2) Cultivating collaborative opportunities between renowned investigators in the fields of regenerative medicine and rehabilitation (Collaborations Aim); 3) Coordinating a pilot funding program to support novel lines of Regenerative Rehabilitation research (Pilot Funding Aim); 4) Developing and validating technologies to advance the measurement and use of the regenerative rehabilitation programs (Technology Aim); 5) Promoting our center’s expertise to a broad community of trainees, investigators, and clinicians (Promotion Aim); 6) Carefully monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of our program will ensure that we are successful in achieving our goals (Quality Control Aim). Administrative note: In the preparation of this proposal, we made every effort to present a comprehensive and detailed plan for achieving our goals while minimizing redundancy. Therefore, in multiple places, we refer the reader to specific components of the application, rather than repeating text. We appreciate the time and effort the reviewers devote to the evaluation of the proposals.  Sincerely, Fabrisia, Tom and Mike PROJECT NARRATIVE  Regenerative Rehabilitation is the integration of principles and approaches across the fields of rehabilitation science and regenerative medicine. The integration of these two fields will increase the efficiency of interventions designed to optimize physical functioning to the benefit of a wide range of individuals with disabilities. The Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training (AR3T) 2.0 will build on the momentum gained over the first cycle of funding with the goal of continuing to illuminate and seize opportunities to expand scientific knowledge, expertise and methodologies in the domain of Regenerative Rehabilitation.",Alliance for Regenerative Rehabilitation Research & Training 2.0 (AR3T 2.0),10210417,P2CHD086843,"['Accountability', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Biocompatible Materials', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Country', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'In Vitro', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Natural regeneration', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Physical Function', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Reader', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Systems Analysis', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'career', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'falls', 'functional restoration', 'gait examination', 'healing', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interest', 'investigator training', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pre-clinical', 'programs', 'regenerative', 'regenerative rehabilitation', 'regenerative therapy', 'rehabilitation research', 'rehabilitation science', 'repaired', 'response', 'sabbatical', 'social media', 'success', 'symposium', 'technological innovation', 'therapy design', 'tissue regeneration', 'webinar']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,P2C,2021,983634
"Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement ABSTRACT Post-treatment substance use disorder (SUD) relapse rates are high (40-60% at one year), with relapse occurring early (median time to relapse 1-3 months), indicating that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Telehealth and VR technologies have the ability to greatly increase the accessibility of highly engaging recovery support. Combining these two approaches provides a unique opportunity to create a highly engaging, cost-effective take home recovery support solution targeting the critical transition from inpatient care. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its existing highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app, to develop a convenient and cost-effective integrated take-home combined VR and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) that begins in the inpatient clinic. RecoVRi is designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from inpatient to home, thereby reducing the risk of relapse and associated health and monetary costs. Sober Grid is collaborating with TRIPP, Inc. to utilize TRIPP’s immersive wellness platform. The design of the TRIPP experience leverages a large body of existing research on the use of VR technology in the mental wellness arena and utilizes proven mindfulness structures, targeted sound frequencies, visuals and interactions that have a multiplicative effect when administered through immersion. The Sober Grid Network will create a support wrapper to the VR experience that facilitates access to crisis management experts and community for the person in early recovery. The unique combination of a personalized and targeted self-regulation toolkit and community and professional support is a key differentiator for this service. In phase I of the project, we will develop and pilot test a proof-of-concept RecoVRi VR-mindfulness protocol and intervention to ascertain feasibility and acceptability (Aim 1). In phase II of the project, a production-quality intervention will be developed with new VR content created by the TRIPP development team specifically targeting themes supporting recovery from alcohol, stimulant and opioid SUD separately (Aim 2). We will then test post-treatment recovery support engagement in the RecoVRi intervention in comparison to treatment as usual in a randomized comparison trial involving 80 patients receiving inpatient treatment and transitioning to the home setting (Aim 3). Over the span of both phases, we will seek regulatory guidance from the FDA in order to attain clearance for use of the RecoVRi intervention as a therapeutic medical device (Aim 4). NARRATIVE Substance use treatment research findings indicate that the transition period from inpatient care to the home environment is particularly challenging for patients seeking sobriety. Sober Grid proposes to leverage its highly accessible social and peer coaching mobile recovery app to develop and test a convenient and cost-effective, integrated, take-home combined, virtual reality and professional peer coaching recovery support intervention (RecoVRi) designed to increase engagement with recovery therapy during the critical transition from the inpatient clinic to home.",Integration of Virtual Reality Mindfulness Application Within a Mobile-Based Recovery Platform to Support Rehab and Post-Rehab Engagement,10209530,R44DA050222,"['Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Android', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Development', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Health', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Immersion', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Medical Device', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Randomized', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Well in self', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'addiction', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mobile application', 'new technology', 'peer', 'peer coaching', 'peer support', 'prototype', 'relapse prediction', 'relapse risk', 'sobriety', 'social', 'sound frequency', 'substance use treatment', 'success', 'telehealth', 'therapy design', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment program', 'treatment research', 'virtual reality']",NIDA,"SOBER GRID, INC.",R44,2021,840913
"Automated Digital Imaging for Cervical Cancer Screening Project Abstract/Summary: Cervical cancer screening programs remain essential to reduce cervical cancer in women despite the availability of human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccines. Screening is important for all women but is particularly important for women living with HIV given the high prevalence of HPV in this group and risks associated with progression notwithstanding antiretroviral therapy. Here we propose to investigate the clinical utility of a new method of automated digital imaging of the cervix on the MobileODT platform as a screen-and-treat approach. We build on a long-term collaboration between the University of Cape Town and Columbia University investigating how to strengthen cervical cancer screening and treatment in South Africa. Currently, screen-and-treat programs utilizing HPV DNA testing are recommended by the World Health Organization. We have demonstrated the safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of this approach for the South African setting with its high HIV prevalence in women. In this setting, we are currently completing an NCI- supported study demonstrating the feasibility and outstanding performance of an HPV DNA assay that can be used at the point-of-care for a single-visit, screen-and-treat program. Here we propose to extend this work to investigate in Specific Aim 1: the performance characteristics of automated digital imaging as a standalone, primary screening test to replace HPV DNA testing for use in the single-visit, screen-and-treat approach; Specific Aim 2: the performance characteristics of automated digital imaging as a triage test for women who test HPV DNA positive in the screen- and-treat approach; and Specific Aim 3: facility-level operational challenges and facilitators to integrating this new imaging technology into single-visit screen-and-treat programs. We propose to undertake the studies to address these aims among women living with and without HIV at clinical sites in Cape Town, South Africa. Our overall goal is to strengthen cervical cancer screening approaches to reduce cost and improve the effectiveness of screening. Project Narrative We propose to investigate the accuracy and implementation potential of a new technology that provides an automated and almost instant classification of cervical cancer precursor lesions based on a cloud-based, machine-learning algorithm of an image of the cervix. We will investigate the clinical utility of this new technology for integrating into screen-and-treat programs for women living with and without HIV in South Africa.",Automated Digital Imaging for Cervical Cancer Screening,10210372,R01CA254576,"['Acetic Acids', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Colposcopes', 'Colposcopy', 'Cytology', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'FDA approved', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV', 'Health Services', 'High Prevalence', 'Histologic', 'Human Papilloma Virus Vaccine', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Human papilloma virus infection', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'India', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Price', 'Primary Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'South Africa', 'South African', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Group', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'automated visual evaluation', 'base', 'clinical research site', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'effectiveness study', 'high risk population', 'histological specimens', 'improved', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'point of care', 'programs', 'recruit', 'screening', 'screening program', 'success', 'viral DNA']",NCI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,519004
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis Project Summary/Abstract: Coccidioidomycosis, caused by the highly infectious dimorphic fungi Coccidioides posadasii and C. immitis, inflicts a heavy and rapidly growing burden of disease, with 150,000 new cases annually in the United States. Clinical symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are highly variable, depending on the degree of exposure and robustness of host cell-mediated immunity – 40% of exposed individuals develop an acute primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis syndrome indistinguishable from regular community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). While most of these patients eventually resolve their infection, 41-43% are hospitalized for a median of 6 days, with disabling symptoms lasting several months. A subset of patients, especially individuals with impaired cell-mediated immunity, progress to other, more severe coccidioidal clinical syndromes, including disseminated infection, with high rates of morbidity and death. Although coccidioidomycosis causes 30% of CAP cases in highly endemic regions, the clinical presentation is challenging to differentiate from viral or bacterial CAP and available diagnostic tests have significant limitations, leading to median diagnostic delays of 23-48 days, with many patients having delays lasting several months. Meanwhile, patients seek medical care for their symptoms, with unnecessary hospitalizations, exposure to empiric broad- spectrum antibiotics, laboratory tests, imaging, and invasive procedures. A critical barrier to improving clinical outcomes in these patients is the lack of reliable diagnostic methods that identify coccidioidomycosis early in the course of infection and distinguish it from other common infections with a similar clinical presentation. Once coccidioidomycosis is diagnosed, it is also challenging to determine whether patients are responding to antifungal therapy, due to slow resolution of symptoms and abnormal imaging and laboratory findings. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis based on detection of fungal volatile metabolites in the breath. We will test the hypotheses that (a) patients with coccidioidomycosis have unique breath metabolites that differentiate them from patients with other infections, and (b) kinetics of these metabolites predict responses to antifungal therapy. We will: (1) identify breath volatile metabolites that distinguish patients with coccidioidomycosis from those with similar clinical syndromes, including CAP and other mycoses, and (2) examine the relationship between early changes in these breath metabolites in patients with coccidioidomycosis treated with antifungal therapy and their clinical outcome. Successful completion of these aims will lay the groundwork for a novel assay for the direct detection of Coccidioides metabolism that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the rapid, bedside identification of patients with coccidioidomycosis, reducing diagnostic delays, guiding appropriate initiation of treatment in patients at risk for severe or disseminated disease, averting unnecessary antibiotic use, and improving clinical outcomes in patients with this morbid, life-threatening infection. Project Narrative Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, inflicts a heavy and growing burden of disease in the Americas, with over 150,000 new cases per year in the United States alone. Because symptoms of Valley Fever are nonspecific and currently available diagnostic tests are unable to differentiate Valley Fever from other infections early in the course of infection, patients are often only diagnosed weeks to several months after they initially present with symptoms. We will identify fungal metabolites in the breath that (a) can be used to diagnose Valley Fever earlier in the course of infection than currently possible, differentiating it from other fungal infections and other common infections such as viral or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, and (b) allow monitoring of the clinical response to antifungal therapy, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes in patients with this highly debilitating and life-threatening infection.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis,10110180,R21AI156279,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Americas', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibody Response', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Arizona', 'Aspergillosis', 'Biological Assay', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Coccidioides', 'Coccidioides immitis', 'Coccidioides posadasii', 'Coccidioidomycosis', 'Coupled', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Histoplasmosis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycoses', 'Outcome', 'Paracoccidioidomycosis', 'Patients', 'Primary Infection', 'Procedures', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'community acquired pneumonia', 'desert fever', 'disabling symptom', 'fungus', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'response', 'sensor', 'supervised learning', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'treatment response']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,278671
"Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents Asthma self‐management is essential for preventing exacerbations and reducing the burden of the disease. However, poor adherence to prescribed treatment and poor recognition of symptoms leads to reduced asthma control, particularly among adolescents. Studies show that adolescents lack understanding about self‐management, and that asthma education during clinic visits is deficient, resulting in insufficient asthma management. Mobile technology, specifically, mobile applications (or apps) are an efficient way to increase patient‐provider communication, provide feedback on asthma management, and deliver asthma education. Our pilot work has demonstrated that an app can be effective at improving asthma control in adolescents aged 12‐17, and that adolescents are enthusiastic about utilizing mHealth technologies for asthma management, but that existing apps are not engaging or appealing enough to an adolescent population to sustain long‐term use. For this pilot study, we will test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self‐management in order to obtain data necessary to complete a future large efficacy trial of the app in adolescents with persistent asthma. The objective of this project is to use an agile, iterative, user‐centered design process to tailor our existing proof of concept app to adolescent user preferences and to use a mixed‐ methods approach to test feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and preliminary efficacy. The long‐term goal is to identify mHealth technological approaches that facilitate self‐management of chronic diseases, particularly among adolescents, and to develop marketing strategies to promote long‐term support of these approaches. The rationale for this project is that adolescents are quick to adopt mobile technologies, have a high degree of smartphone use, and are at a point of transition from parental management of their chronic condition to self‐ management, making this a priority population for the development of interventions targeting asthma control. For this project, we have two specific aims: 1) To refine an asthma self‐management app for adolescents with persistent asthma; and 2) To assess feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to the app in a small randomized controlled trial. The approach is innovative because we are incorporating a user‐centered design process to integrate multiple components for facilitating asthma self‐management in a mHealth tool tailored for adolescents within the Technology Acceptance Model framework. Despite studies showing that mHealth tools can be effective, few have prioritized an adolescent audience or evaluated the tool compared to standard of care using rigorous, mixed‐method approaches. This research is significant because asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood in the US and the prevalence of the condition continues to rise, and so innovative tools to improve self‐management of the disease are critically needed. Asthma is the most common chronic disease in childhood, which makes the proposed research a significant public health burden. This pilot is designed to test the feasibility, acceptability, and adherence to a smartphone app for asthma self-management among adolescents with persistent asthma. Knowledge gained from this pilot study will be used to design and conduct a future efficacy trial of the app. This project addresses the mission of NHLBI by developing a novel intervention to treat asthma. This study leverages our formative and pilot work to continue making strides towards enhancing asthma control among adolescents with persistent asthma in order to reduce asthma-related morbidity.",Feasibility of mHealth Technology for Improving Self-Management and Adherence Among Asthmatic Adolescents,10224318,R34HL145442,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'African American', 'Age', 'Asthma', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Florida', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Information System', 'Hispanics', 'Incentives', 'Inhalators', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk-Taking', 'Sample Size', 'Self Management', 'Smoking', 'Social Change', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Teenagers', 'Telephone', 'Universities', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'age group', 'aged', 'arm', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'design', 'effectiveness trial', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'feasibility testing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mHealth', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient-clinician communication', 'peak flow measurement', 'preference', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R34,2021,256469
"Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are the gold-standard method of evaluating cancer treatment, which has immense health and economic burdens worldwide. However, practical considerations that allow an RCT to be conducted typically require a relatively small sample size and restricted eligibility criteria such that the study has inadequate power to generalize treatment effects to elderly patients or other under-represented patient pop- ulations. On the other hand, massive real-world data (RWD) are increasingly captured by population-based databases and registries, such as Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER), SEER-Medicare, and National Cancer Database (NCDB), that have much broader demographic and clinical diversity compared to RCT cohorts. Treatment evaluation using causal inference methods and RWD that were not collected purely for re- search purposes is now frequently performed but fraught with limitations such as confounding due to lack of randomization. In fact, the agreement between RCT and RWD ﬁndings is often low in the analysis of matched RCT and RWD studies with the same treatment comparisons. Although several national organizations and reg- ulatory agencies have advocated using RWD to complement RCTs, methods that integrate these two potentially complementary data sources and achieve better treatment evaluation over the use of a single data source alone have yet to be developed.  This proposal is motivated by the PIs' collaborative work to study the safety and efﬁcacy of treatment strategies for elderly non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and esophageal cancer patients by integrating data from multiple sources: RCTs from NCI cooperative groups and the real-world databases (e.g. SEER, SEER-Medicare, and NCDB). The objective of this project is to develop new statistical methods for integrative analyses of RCTs and RWD that can improve the generalizability and increase estimation efﬁciency of RCT ﬁndings to more diverse ""real-world"" patients as well as under-studied populations while avoiding confounding bias inherent in RWD. In Aim 1, we develop methods for statistical analysis of RCT data to compare chemoradiotherapy patterns for the real-world and elderly NSCLC patients by leveraging the baseline covariates of comparable patients from SEER, for whom the temporal information of chemotherapy and radiation and the outcome are both missing. Aims 2 and 3 focus on the settings when both RCT and RWD provide comparable covariates, treatment, and outcome information. In Aim 2, we develop improved analysis of RCT data to evaluate trimodality therapy versus surgery alone for the real-world and elderly esophageal cancer patients by exploiting the large sample size and predictive power offered by the NCDB/SEER-Medicare. In Aim 3, we develop new efﬁcient and data-adaptive methods to estimate individualized treatment effects of adjuvant chemotherapy versus observation, possibly modiﬁed by age and tumor size, for stage IB resected NSCLC patients by integrating RCT and NCDB data. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed research is closely in line with the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, which placed additional focus on the use of big real-world data to support decision making and precision medicine. The availability of multiple data sources, namely randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and real-world databases, presents unique and novel opportunities for medical research, because the knowledge that can be acquired from integrative analyses would not be possible from any single-source analysis alone. Our effort is important to bridge RCTs and vast real-world databases and registries arising from clinical practices in order to better understand how treatment works for the real-world and under-studied patient populations outside relatively narrow RCT eligibility criteria and provide accurate and reliable evidence for patient-centered care.",Empower treatment effects evaluation of randomized clinical trials for elderly patients with integrated real-world data,10149900,R01AG066883,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Advocate', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Area', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of esophagus', 'Medical Research', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'SEER Program', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Target Populations', 'Therapy trial', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'disease registry', 'esophageal cancer patient', 'health economics', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'individualized medicine', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'population based', 'precision medicine', 'safety study', 'study population', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NIA,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R01,2021,391243
"Enteric Pathogen Force of Infection among Children using Serology Enteric pathogen infections are a leading cause of the global disease burden, with the largest burden among children in low-resource settings. Stool-based PCR methods have dramatically improved our ability to measure enteric infections, but the challenge of collecting stool and need for near-continuous monitoring to detect many globally important pathogens has thwarted broader use in large-scale surveillance. Large-scale, population- based surveys now regularly collect blood to monitor transmission and burden of diseases such as HIV, malaria and dengue. Broader testing of blood collected in such surveys with multiplex assays represents a new opportunity to measure enteric pathogen transmission and burden. Antibody-based measures could complement stool-based PCR testing because antibody responses remain elevated for many months after infection, thus providing more information in studies with infrequent measurements. Our team has developed multiplex bead assays that measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) response to diverse enteric pathogens. In preliminary studies we have shown that IgG levels can be used to measure heterogeneity in enteric pathogen transmission between populations. We have also shown the results generalize to pathogens that span taxa. In this application, we propose to complete a series of studies that address key next steps to advance the seroepidemiology of enteric pathogens in low-resource settings. We will conduct a longitudinal birth cohort in Ecuador that pairs high resolution, multiplex stool-based PCR infection with longitudinal, multiplex IgG and IgA measurements. Our 17- year research history at the site has documented substantial variation in enteric pathogen infection across a rural-urban gradient, making it an ideal setting for the research. The cohort will enroll 600 children from three sites across a rural-urban gradient, and measure them frequently from birth to 24 months. On the Luminex platform, we will pair multiplex PCR assessment for 15 enteric pathogens with IgG and IgA assessment in a multiplex bead assay that includes antigens to 7 enteric pathogens: Campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Giardia duodenalis, Cryptosporidium parvum, Entamoeba histolytica, and norovirus. In Aim 1, we will use molecular and antibody-based measures to study force of infection of the enteric pathogens across a rural-urban gradient. This will represent the first broad-based comparison of seroepidemiologic measures against patent infection for enterics. In Aim 2, we will estimate enteric pathogen force of infection by applying current-status models to population-based, cross-sectional serology surveys in the region, and will benchmark the cross-sectional estimates against those obtained in the concurrent longitudinal study. In Aim 3, we will study IgG and IgA kinetics following infection for each of the 7 pathogens, and develop models to accurately predict recent infections and incidence from antibody levels measured in cross-sectional serology surveys. Completion of these aims will result in generalizable seroepidemiologic methods that have the potential to transform measurement of enteric pathogen transmission and burden in low-resource settings. Project Narrative / Lay Language Description Pathogens that cause diarrheal disease account for an immense global public health burden, primarily among young children in low-resource settings. The use of antibodies to study the epidemiology of diarrhea-causing pathogens has potential to improve our measurement of pathogen transmission in research and surveillance. This project will advance the epidemiologic methods used to measure diarrhea-causing pathogen exposure at the population level, by completing the first comprehensive study that pairs antibody-based and stool-based measures of infection among a birth cohort living across a rural-urban gradient in Ecuador.",Enteric Pathogen Force of Infection among Children using Serology,10277352,R01AI162867,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Age', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Response', 'Antigens', 'Arboviruses', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Tests', 'Campylobacter jejuni', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cross Infection', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Cryptosporidium parvum', 'Data', 'Dengue', 'Diarrhea', 'Disease', 'Ecuador', 'Enrollment', 'Entamoeba histolytica', 'Enteral', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Feces', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Giardia', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'HIV', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Kinetics', 'Language', 'Legal patent', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Newborn Infant', 'Norovirus', 'Population', 'Population Density', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Salmonella enterica', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serology', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Urbanization', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'antibody detection', 'antibody test', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'design', 'diarrheal disease', 'enteric infection', 'enteric pathogen', 'enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli', 'gut microbiome', 'improved', 'infant death', 'insight', 'pathogen', 'pathogen exposure', 'population based', 'public health intervention', 'response', 'serosurveillance', 'serosurvey', 'stool sample', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'urban area']",NIAID,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,781015
"Phase III COBRE:  Multimodal Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders (MIND) Project Summary/Abstract  This Phase III (P-III) COBRE project will extend the cores that have been successfully leveraged in our Phase I (P-I) and Phase II (P-II) COBRE projects and sustain these unique resources in New Mexico through the im- plementation of a business plan. Over the past eight years we have built up infrastructure and created a cutting edge brain imaging center, our P-II project is just over half-way through and is even more successful than our P- I was at this point in time. The Mind Research Network (MRN) houses an Elekta Neuromag 306-channel MEG System, a high density EEG lab, a 3T Siemens Trio MRI scanner, and a mobile 1.5T Siemens Avanto MRI scanner. Additional resources include a centralized neuroinformatics system, a strong IT management plan, and state-of-the-art image analysis expertise and tools. This P-III COBRE center will continue our momentum and move the cores we have developed into a position of long term sustainability. We will continue with the technical cores established during the P-II project including multimodal data acquisition (MDA), algorithm and data analy- sis (ADA), and biostatistics and neuro-informatics (BNI). These cores have begun to serve MRN and the greater community, as well as other institutions including extensive collaborations with IDeA funded projects in New Mexico and other states. We believe this P-III COBRE is extremely well-positioned to establish and sustain New Mexico as one of the premier brain imaging sites. We include an extensive pilot project program (PPP) that is built on the successful pilot programs implemented as part of the earlier COBRE phases. This includes an ex- tensive educational, mentoring, and faculty development program to carefully mentor and position faculty who use the cores to maximize their potential to successfully compete for external funding, thus fulfilling the ultimate goals of the COBRE program. 2 Narrative  This Phase III COBRE project is a natural extension of our Phase I and II COBRE projects which were cen- tered on mentoring individual researchers along with building the necessary infrastructure to support multimodal neuroimaging in mental illness. During this time, cutting-edge cores were developed that facilitated not only our local projects but also research at multiple institutions across New Mexico; the cores served as neuroimaging facilities and training centers for others to utilize. The Phase III project will ensure the sustainability of these cores as they transition to being fully funded by a broad cadre of users with various funding sources. We propose three technical cores including a multimodal data acquisition (MDA) core, an algorithm and data analysis (ADA) core, and a biostatistics and neuro-informatics (BNI) core. These cores have already shown their utility and have begun to be leveraged by users outside the COBRE. In addition, we propose a robust pilot project program (PPP) to continue to seed and enable new users of the cores to ultimately grow and sustain world class brain imaging research within our IDeA state, thus fulfilling the ultimate goals of the COBRE program. 1",Phase III COBRE:  Multimodal Imaging of Neuropsychiatric Disorders (MIND),10372242,P30GM122734,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Bipolar Depression', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Businesses', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Department of Energy', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Agency', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Leadership', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mind-Body Method', 'Mission', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'New Mexico', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Seeds', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'base', 'cohesion', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'distinguished professor', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'meetings', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'programs', 'tool']",NIGMS,LOVELACE BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE,P30,2021,373857

"A Learning Health System Approach to Precision Sedation and Analgesia in Critically-Ill Children PROJECT ABSTRACT Approximately 500,000 children suffer critical illness every year in the United States and more than one third will receive a continuous infusion of a sedative-analgesic medication such as an opioid or dexmedetomidine. Such drugs are commonly administered to ease the burden of critical illness by treating serious pain and anxiety associated with invasive organ support delivery and procedures in the intensive care unit. However, there are no widely-accepted standards for the administration of these potent neuroactive medications and several studies have demonstrated that children receive too little or too much of these medications nearly half of the time they are administered. This imprecision in conventional dosing strategies leads to adverse events, including acute physiologic deterioration, drug tolerance and dependency, prolonged illness and hospitalization and life-threatening complications of invasive support such as unplanned extubation and post-extubation airway obstruction. Evidence also indicates that relatively short exposures to these medications may be detrimental to long-term neurodevelopment. More precise strategies for administering these medications to children are needed and this is an issue of major  PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinicians caring for critically ill children routinely struggle to harmonize the tension between giving too much versus too little sedation-analgesia. This work will (1) identify patterns of sedation-analgesia associated with outcome; (2) identify genotypes associated with sedation-analgesia administration; (3) characterize PK parameters of common sedative-analgesic mediations; and (4) promote the development of the PI as an independent Learning Health System researcher.

"Patient Oriented Research and Mentorship and Training in Functional Neuroimaging of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ABSTRACT  This K24 Mid-Career Investigator Career Development Award seeks support for training and mentorship for Christopher Pittenger, MD, Ph.D., a well-established, tenured Associate Professor in Psychiatry at Yale University, Director of the Yale OCD Research Clinic, and Assistant Chair for Translational Research in the Department of Psychiatry. Dr. Pittenger leads a robust patient-oriented research (POR) research program, which is integrated with his basic/translational lab-based research and has produced important new insights into the neurobiological underpinnings and novel treatment avenues for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS). Dr. Pittenger has a long-standing commitment to mentorship; most notably, he is Co-Director of the Neuroscience Research Training Program (NRTP), the research track within the Yale psychiatry residency.  The training plan supported by this grant will allow Dr. Pittenger to increase his skills in quantitative analysis, with a focus on advanced statistical methods and on the design and analysis of fMRI studies. These are areas in which he already has active research with expert collaborators; the aim of the proposed training plan is to enhance his own proficiency to make him a more effective collaborator and mentor in these important domains. Additional training is focused on his own abilities as a mentor and leader, with the goal of increasing his efficacy in the management of his own research groups and in effective and individualized mentorship. These training activities will take place in the context of two NIMH- funded research studies. The first, R01 MH116038, is a recently funded grant on which Dr. Pittenger is co-PI with his close collaborator Alan Anticevic and deploys cutting-edge imaging technology and data analysis approaches to examine brain network connectivity parallels and predictors of therapeutic response to pharmacotherapy in OCD. The second, R01 MH100068, is a grant with collaborator Michelle Hampson that is developing real-time fMRI neurofeedback as a probe and potential treatment for OCD, with promising early results. These two exciting projects provide a fruitful vehicle for the proposed training in statistics and neuroimaging.  Dr. Pittenger will devote substantial time to mentoring under this award. One major focus will be the NRTP; the plan is for him to take over as Director of this program over the next few years, and to take the lead in the next resubmission of our T32 grant in 2022. Support of this increased mentorship effort is a second major motivation for the current application.

"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

"Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing 7. Project Summary/Abstract Adult human skin heals by developing fibrotic scar tissue, which can result in devastating disfigurement, growth restriction, and permanent functional loss. Despite a plethora of clinical options, no current treatment strategies successfully prevent or reverse this fibrotic process, and scars and their sequelae cost the United States over $20 billion every year. Progress towards the development of new therapies has been significantly hindered by a lack of understanding of the specific cell populations responsible for scarring. In 2015, our group reported that Engrailed-1 (En-1) lineage-positive fibroblasts (EPFs) are responsible for the vast majority of dorsal scar production in postnatal mice. In early fetal gestation, mice heal scarlessly via skin regeneration, an ideal outcome mediated by En-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts (ENFs; the predominant fetal fibroblast). However, it has not been established if ENFs contribute to postnatal wound healing. In this proposal, we explore for the first time the postnatal conversion of ENFs to pro-fibrotic EPFs (postnatally-derived EPFs; pEPFs) within the wound environment. First, histology, immunohistochemistry, and wounding in a novel transgenic mouse model will be used to study the conversion of ENFs to pEPFs during wound healing. By examining the behavior of ENF subpopulations (derived from papillary dermis, reticular dermis, and hypodermis) in the wound environment and confirming our findings in a tamoxifen-inducible mouse model of En-1 activation, we will precisely define the ENF population that gives rise to pro-fibrotic pEPFs. Second, we will establish the specific wound environment cues that drive ENF-to-EPF transition. Given that mechanical forces are known to modulate both scar burden and fibroblast activity, we will use in vitro and in vivo models to examine the effects of mechanical environment on En-1 activation. We will further use transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling to explore the role of mechanotransduction signaling in ENF-to-EPF transition and pEPF function. Third, having established a mechanotransduction mechanism underlying En-1 activation in wound ENFs, we will inhibit mechanotransduction signaling with the goal of blocking ENF-to-EPF transition. Specifically, we will assess whether blocking mechanotransduction results in ENF-mediated wound healing with reduced fibrosis. Our ultimate translational goal is to develop therapeutics that target fibrogenic fibroblasts to promote regenerative healing. Collectively, the proposed work will significantly enhance our understanding of the key molecular and cellular determinants of cutaneous scarring, inform the development of novel anti-scarring therapies, and shed light on the cellular origin of dermal scarring fibroblasts. 8. Project Narrative Scarring is the end result of injury in adult human skin and results in an enormous financial and medical burden for our society. There are currently no effective molecular therapies that prevent scarring or its sequelae, and development of therapeutics has been hindered by lack of understanding of the precise cell populations that mediate fibrosis in wound healing. Therefore, we propose to explore the contribution of a specific fibroblast subpopulation (Engrailed-1 lineage-negative fibroblasts; ENFs) in fibrotic wound healing, in order to inform novel directions for targeted treatments that minimize scarring and promote regenerative wound healing.",Mechanoresponsive Engrailed-1-negative fibroblasts activate Engrailed-1 to promote fibrosis in wound healing,10130573,R01GM136659,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomic Surface', 'Behavior', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Chromatin', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cues', 'Cultured Cells', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermal', 'Dermis', 'Development', 'Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV', 'Dorsal', 'Elements', 'Engraftment', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fiber', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hair follicle structure', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hydrogels', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mechanics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Papillary', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Subcutaneous Tissue', 'Surface', 'Tamoxifen', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transposase', 'United States', 'Verteporfin', 'Visual', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'cost', 'digital', 'epigenomics', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'functional loss', 'healing', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mechanical force', 'mechanotransduction', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'postnatal', 'prevent', 'reconstruction', 'regenerative', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skin regeneration', 'skin wound', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic target', 'tissue culture', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy', 'wound', 'wound bed', 'wound environment', 'wound healing']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,317427
"Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform Background. Research has identified a wide range of evidence-based interventions for key behavioral health risks such as poor diet, smoking, unhealthy alcohol use, or a sedentary lifestyle. However, to be truly successful, behavioral intervention science should fulfill at least three key criteria: (1) demonstration of cumulative increases in intervention efficacy; (2) provision of interventions that reach a high proportion of those in need; and (3) demonstration of a meaningful population impact/reduction in disease burden. It currently meets none of these. Some reasons for this include (1) over-reliance on an imprecise delivery mechanism (people; usually therapists or coaches of some kind) that is difficult to train to fidelity on a large scale, and that cannot be manipulated with precision; (2) use of sample sizes that may be far below what is needed to accurately characterize heterogeneity of response; and (3) cross-study variability in therapist characteristics, sample characteristics, and measurement strategy. All of this combines to create a science that lacks evidence of cumulative improvements upon prior benchmarks. Proposed solution. Mobile technology shows significant promise as an intervention delivery mechanism that is replicable, transparent, modular, and precise. However, progress in the development and implementation of mobile interventions has been slowed by factors such as the tremendous time and money needed to develop an intervention; limitations in cross-platform compatibility and interoperability; and lack of a consistent system around which to collaborate. To address these needs, the PI developed the Computerized Intervention Authoring System (CIAS), which facilitates behavioral intervention science by allowing investigators to directly develop sophisticated and interactive mobile applications without programming. CIAS is already being used by investigators outside of the PI’s own lab, a process that has revealed significant interest in this software from a wide range of NIH-funded investigators, as well as significant limitations. Current aims. The proposed application will address these limitations, making CIAS into a significant, open-source, and virtually unique non-commercial research resource. In Aim 1, we will engage in sustained user experience testing designed to make the tool far more intuitive to use. This process is expected to result in a dramatic reorganization of the investigator interface, as well as in a complete set of evidence-based user training and support materials. In Aim 2, we will add a range of features and capabilities to make CIAS more powerful, flexible, and interoperable (e.g., by building to SMART Health IT standards, as well as FHIR open specifications to facilitate integration with Electronic Health Records). In Aim 3, we will engage in focused efforts to promote the use of CIAS as part of multi-lab collaborations using open science practices (e.g., via integration with the Open Science Framework). Importantly, we will engage in all of the above with the assistance of a highly accomplished panel of advisors who will help ensure that the final product is broadly relevant, future-facing, and usable to a broad range of behavioral scientists. Project Narrative Technology-delivered interventions are showing great potential to help people modify unhealthy behaviors like substance use, poor diet, and poor medication adherence. However, designing these interventions is time- consuming and expensive, which is slowing down research in this area as well as the rate at which such technology can help people. This project will develop a new version of existing software so it can allow scientists to easily and quickly collaborate to develop powerful interventions for mobile devices.","Accelerating collaborative, cumulative, and open intervention science with an e-intervention authoring platform",10271571,U24EB028990,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Apple', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Budgets', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Eating', 'Ecosystem', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Health behavior', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Investments', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Operating System', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SMART health', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoking', 'Support System', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translations', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Unhealthy Diet', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'alcohol misuse', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brief intervention', 'burden of illness', 'comparison intervention', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diet and exercise', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'good diet', 'handheld mobile device', 'healthy weight', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'intervention effect', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'open data', 'open source', 'prevent', 'reduced substance use', 'repository', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'software development', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'user centered design', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIBIB,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,U24,2021,377490
"Regulation of Cell Death and Inflammation by ISG15 during SARS-CoV2 Infection SARS-CoV2 is a highly contagious, novel human coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Currently over 7.4 million people in the US have confirmed infection with SARS-CoV2 and over 215,000 have died. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by pulmonary and systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction, which disproportionally affects elderly patients. The mechanism by which SARS-CoV2 triggers such severe pathogenesis is poorly understood. Recent clinical studies have suggested that cell death, especially the induction of necroptosis, may be predictor of severe COVID-19 disease. The mechanism by which the host restricts necroptosis is unclear. In the preliminary data we have shown that the interferon induced protein, ISG15, acts as a negative regulator of necroptosis and its downstream inflammatory responses during viral infection. In this proposal we will test the hypothesis that SARS-CoV2 induces necroptosis and that ISG15 functions as a negative regulator of necroptosis in respiratory epithelial cells. We will use in vitro primary tracheal epithelial cultures (hTECs) and an in vivo mouse adapted SARS-CoV2 animal model to ask several questions including: 1) Does SARS- CoV2 induce necroptosis in respiratory epithelial cells; 2) Does ISG15 modulate necroptotic cell death as well as proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine production in respiratory epithelial cells during SARS-CoV2 infection?; 3) Does necroptosis and its regulation by ISG15 contribute to SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis? Overall, our studies will provide important insight into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV2 infection and provide potential insight into mechanisms underlying severe disease, which may direct efforts toward the development of diagnostic markers and future countermeasures. SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious, novel human coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) which has resulted in severe morbidity and mortality. It remains unclear why certain populations, particularly the elderly, are more susceptible to severe COVID-19 symptoms. The goal of this work is to determine whether excessive inflammatory cell death, regulated by ISG15 and RIPK3, acts as a key factor in severe COVID-19 disease.",Regulation of Cell Death and Inflammation by ISG15 during SARS-CoV2 Infection,10287787,R21AI163822,"['2019-nCoV', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Animal Model', 'Apoptosis', 'Avian Influenza', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'CRISPR screen', 'Caspase', 'Cell Death', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Complex', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HMGB1 Protein', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'ISG15 gene', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Inflammatory Response Pathway', 'Interferons', 'Knockout Mice', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Play', 'Population', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'RIPK3 gene', 'Regulation', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Source', 'Structure of respiratory epithelium', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tracheal Epithelium', 'Tropism', 'Ubiquitin Like Proteins', 'Viral', 'Viral Load result', 'Viral Proteins', 'Viral Respiratory Tract Infection', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'biomarker identification', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'genome-wide', 'high risk population', 'human coronavirus', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'older patient', 'pandemic disease', 'severe COVID-19', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutically effective']",NIAID,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,196875
"Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction Project Summary / Abstract: Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is defined as myocardial ischemia, the inadequate supply of blood to heart muscle, followed by myocardial cell death. Multiple causes of acute MI are widely recognized and can be categorized as thrombotic, non-thrombotic, and acute MI secondary to coronary procedures. The mechanistic cause of a thrombotic MI is the rupture or erosion of an atherosclerotic plaque that results in the formation of a thrombus, or blood clot, which occludes the flow of blood. In contrast, non-thrombotic MI occurs secondary to mechanisms which create an oxygen supply and demand imbalance, but are not associated with atherosclerotic plaque rupture or disruption. Given that myocardial cell death is the pathological characteristic that is common to all acute MI, non-invasive diagnostics for acute MI are based on the detection of myocardial cell death. Currently non-invasive diagnostics for differentiating thrombotic MI from non-thrombotic MI do not exist which results in sub-optimal treatment and diminished patient safety. Further, it is not known how the impacts on metabolism and biological processes differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI. In this project, we will address both of these problems. We will develop a diagnostic method for the non-invasive differentiation of thrombotic MI versus non-thrombotic MI that will enable earlier, safer, and more precise targeting of therapeutics to patients suffering from acute MI. We will determine biological processes that differ between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI, which will suggest targets for therapeutic intervention that are specific to the underlying cause of an acute MI. In Aim 1 we will utilize high resolution mass spectrometry to determine the absolute concentration of over 500 proteins in previously collected plasma samples from human subjects who were experiencing an acute MI for which the cause (thrombotic versus non-thrombotic) was determined. This will enable us to determine which proteins report on the cause of the acute MI as opposed to the presence of myocardial cell death. A critical advantage of our study design is that we have repeated measures from the same human subjects: at the time of presentation, 6 hours post-presentation, and at a stable event-free follow-up timepoint 3 months after the acute MI. In Aim 2 we will integrate this data with our existing data on the abundances of metabolites and lipids generated from the same human subject samples. This integrated data will facilitate an in-depth analysis of the differences between thrombotic and non-thrombotic MI in the activities of metabolic pathways, receptor-ligand binding events, and other biochemical reactions. Further we will conduct data- dependent systems biology analyses that will highlight proteins, metabolites, and lipids that are co-abundant in plasma and will evaluate how the topology of these related entities differs between thrombotic and non- thrombotic MI. In Aim 3 we will develop a statistical classifier for the determination of the underlying cause of an acute MI. We will conduct a blinded evaluation of the performance of this classifier in a second cohort. Project Narrative: Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) is one of the leading causes of death in the United States and globally. Currently a non-invasive method of determining the underlying cause of an acute myocardial infarction does not exist, and it is unknown how different causes of acute myocardial infarction affect or alter metabolic processes. This project will use previously collected blood plasma from humans experiencing an acute myocardial infarction to develop a diagnostic method for determining the underlying cause of the event and how the different causes alter metabolic processes.",Integrated proteomic and metabolomics analysis of thrombotic myocardial infarction,10087409,SC1GM139730,"['Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blinded', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Death', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Guidelines', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infarction', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Lipids', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardium', 'Necrosis', 'Oxygen', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Platelet Activation', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Rupture', 'Sampling', 'Secondary to', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thrombosis', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vascular blood supply', 'Work', 'atherosclerotic plaque rupture', 'base', 'cohort', 'design', 'differential expression', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human subject', 'improved', 'insight', 'lipid metabolism', 'lipidomics', 'liquid chromatography mass spectrometry', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel diagnostics', 'optimal treatments', 'patient safety', 'protein metabolite', 'proteomic signature', 'receptor', 'safety outcomes', 'statistical and machine learning', 'targeted treatment', 'thrombotic', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY LAS CRUCES,SC1,2021,222000
"Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities Abstract: Diversity in the rates of progression and mortality of COVID-19 disease within infected African American (AAs) subgroups are clearly not just a function of the underlying health conditions that increase the rate of mortality for COVID -19 patients, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes, but may also be affected by host genetic factors. Here we propose a series of studies to advance the understanding of our knowledge in relative to the health inequity in COVID-19 disease. This is a multiple-collaborative study between Genomic, Imaging research labs and Statistical studies. Research teams in Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) have established intimate relationships that position the institute to focus their research works on underserved minorities. We plan to develop and disseminate technological approaches in identifying host factors that disproportionately affect AAs COVID-19 infected patients. Given that the discovery, and establishment of translational implementation of novel solutions to health disparities in high-risk minority COVID-19 infected is our overall goals. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), encoded on the X-chromosome, has been shown to be a functional receptor for COVID-19 to enter host target cells and the concern might arise regarding whether ACE2 variants between and within subgroups would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infected patients. Therefore, the long-term goal is to compare how genetic variants of the ACE2 receptor, chemokine (CCL2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes (influence the immune system’s response to viruses and bacteria), affects COVID-19 disease severity among people but no underlining disease like diabetes, heart or lung disease with those with mild or no disease manifestations. Short-term goal; we will focus on two aims; Aim: 1-Determine genetic variations in ACE2 gene on obtained DNA samples from COVID-19 infected patients and evaluate for potential correlation between ACE2 variant frequencies in relationship to COVID-19 disease progression and mortalities between and within AAs and non-Hispanic Caucasian CAs subgroup;. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which uses host cell ACE2, TMPRSS2, EZRIN and other proteins for entry. Differences in ACE2 or TMPRSS2/EZRIN genes expression and SNPs may justify the disease disparity and aim 2 will address how COVID-19 spike engagement with host cell receptor is precisely regulated and how host cells respond to cytokines elicited by COVID-19 infection using lung organoids. A recent correlation study suggested that the decrease expression of ACE2 /TMPRSS2/EZRIN are predictors of decreased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and could be attributed to COVID-19 morbidity in Africa American patients. Aim-2: Modeling COVID-19-elicited disease disparity using lung organoids. Clinical validation of ACE2 and EZRIN will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome and mortality gaps between African American and Caucasians patients. . Given the facts of a significant racial disparity in COVID-19 disease among African American (AA) and Caucasians, there is an utmost need to understand the COVID-19 infectivity host factors biology. Apart from socioeconomic factors and underlying comorbidities, AA clearly differ from Caucasians on a number of accounts, including COVID-19 mortalities genetic predisposition, which favors for high incidence and mortality rate COVID- 19 disease manifestations. Studies clearly demonstrate that ACE 2 encoded on the X-chromosome which COVID-19 virus use to entry host may be differentially expressed among individuals, therefore, we propose to determine that ACE2 and other genes, such as Ezrin plays vital role in regulating the COVID-19 virus infectivity resulting in racial disparity and the clinical validation of ACE2 and ezrin will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome gaps between African American and Caucasians.",Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities,10221307,U54MD007602,"['2019-nCoV', 'ACE2', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African American', 'American', 'Bacteria', 'Biology', 'Blood specimen', 'CCL2 gene', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 morbidity', 'COVID-19 mortality', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Caucasians', 'Cells', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinical', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morehouse School of Medicine', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Progressive Disease', 'Proteins', 'Receptor Cell', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Study', 'Subgroup', 'TMPRSS2 gene', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'chemokine', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'differential expression', 'ezrin', 'genetic variant', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'racial disparity', 'receptor', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'underserved minority']",NIMHD,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2021,177500
"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,10153763,K08DK115891,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Membranous Glomerulonephritis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Publications', 'Renal glomerular disease', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biological systems', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'kidney biopsy', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2021,169560
"HABIT DESIGN: TESTING A NOVEL BEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO CORPORATE WELLNESS IN THE CONTEXT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME Abstract Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a constellation of risk factors– elevated triglycerides (TG), insufficient high- density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated blood pressure (BP), elevated fasting blood glucose (FBG), and above-threshold waist circumference (WC)–that is associated with increased cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and some forms of cancer. Research suggests that addressing MetS through the workplace could significantly benefit employee health and employer healthcare costs. Habit Design, Inc., has developed an enhanced behavioral health coaching system called Habit Design (HD) that is the first to integrate habit formation, contingency management, and social learning approaches within a smartphone app to support to behavior change in corporate or employee health contexts. In this Fast Track project, we will adapt the HD approach to address MetS. In Phase I, we will 1) refine and extend existing functional prototypes of the HD app to support the latest versions of iOS and Android, 2) conduct usability testing with 8 targeted end users, and 3) prepare standard treatment manuals for the Phase II clinical trial. In Phase II, we will 1) make indicated changes to the HD app based on findings from the Phase I usability test and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of HD coaching compared to standard health coaching in a randomized trial with 424 corporate wellness program participants who have MetS, with follow-up spanning one year. Participants will employees of TriHealth in Cincinnati who have completed a health screening as part of their corporate wellness program and been identified as having at least 3/5 of the following: 1) TG ≥150 mg/dL), 2) HDL-C <40 mg/dL in males and <50 mg/dL in females, 3) BP ≥130/85 mm Hg, 4) FBG ≥100 mg/dl, and 5) WC ≥102 cm in males and ≥80 cm in females.. All participants will be coached to increase physical activity, which will be monitored with a waist-worn FitBit and Fitabase software. Additionally, participants will choose prior to randomization a goal of increasing fruit and vegetable intake or substituting water for sugar-sweetened beverages. Conditions will be stratified by choice of goal and gender. In both conditions coaching will be monitored for fidelity and delivered in 12 weekly in-person 30-minute sessions followed by one 30-minute maintenance session per month for 4 months. The primary outcome will be average daily step count measured over the course of at least one week at baseline, 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months. The secondary outcome will be standard units increase of fruit/vegetable intake or water intake, according to the participant's choice. Tertiary outcomes will consist of FBG, TG, HDL, BP, WC, and body mass index, measured at each time point. Additionally, we will conduct web-based assessment of self-reported physical activity, junk food, and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption; automaticity of exercise and fruit, vegetable, and water consumption; self-efficacy and social support for target behaviors; and health-related quality of life. Ratings of usability and satisfaction and app usage metrics will be examined. Analyses will be intent-to-treat assuming 15% loss to follow-up. Project Narrative/Relevance Metabolic syndrome is a major public health problem that affects over one in three American adults and increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some forms of cancer.

"Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt Founded in 1965 as one of the original Intellectual and Developmental Disorders Research Centers (IDDRC), the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center (VKC) IDDRC serves as the central nexus across Vanderbilt for interdisciplinary research, communication, and training in intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The VKC IDDRC serves as a trans-institutional institute that brings together over 200 faculty from 38 departments in 10 schools at Vanderbilt. The VKC’s mission to facilitate discoveries that inform best practices to improve the lives of people with IDD and their families. This mission is met by leveraging our outstanding institutional resources and support, partnering with disability communities, and capitalizing on synergistic interactions across the VKC’s federally-designated centers: the VKC IDDRC, a University Center of Excellence in Developmental Disabilities and a Leadership Education in Neurodevelopmental Disabilities program. The IDDRC as the centerpiece of the VKC is the foundational organizing structure that creates a “Center culture” wherein research and discovery permeates the VKC’s broader training and service activities, thus enhancing the translational research goals of the IDDRC. Demonstrable IDDRC success includes 976 investigator- authored publications and robust NIH funding to Vanderbilt to support IDD-related research ($52.6M in FY20). Harnessing and leveraging this trans-institutional strength to focus on unique challenges in IDD, the overarching goal of the next phase of the IDDRC is to develop precision care for IDD by providing infrastructure and scientific leadership to enable rapid translation of basic discoveries into high- impact IDD interventions and treatments. Three global Aims guide the IDDRC’s work. Aim 1 provides core services to enable and disseminate impactful research on individualizing treatments based upon the causes, mechanisms, and contributing co-morbid sequelae of IDD; Aim 2 focuses on incorporating innovative methods and approaches to enhance multidisciplinary IDD research; and Aim 3 proposes to conduct a signature research project to improve the precision use of antipsychotic medication in people with autism. Across these Aims and five Cores supported by the IDDRC (Administrative, Clinical Translational, Translational Neuroscience, Behavioral Phenotyping, and Data Sciences), three themes permeate our work: (1) recruitment of highly-skilled researchers not currently conducting IDD research (non-traditional researchers); (2) inclusion of IDD participants into research studies that currently do not include IDD (non-traditional subjects); and (3) incorporation of novel scientific approaches and methods (non-traditional approaches). Our IDDRC is ideally posed to enable rapid discovery of precision care approaches by supporting 50 investigators leading 70 research projects (15 from NICHD) and, as highlighted by the Signature Research Project, to promote and implement generative, novel, and impactful research directions, thus meeting the NICHD’s vision of applying newly evolved technologies and approaches to rapidly accelerate the prevention and/or amelioration of IDDs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As a group, intellectual and developmental disabilities, including Down syndrome and autism spectrum disorder, have dramatic effects on affected people’s and their caregiver’s lives. Unfortunately, there remains a lack of understanding about what causes these disabilities and, critically, how to treat them with targeted therapies. The Vanderbilt Kennedy Center’s Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center serves as the hub for Vanderbilt’s research efforts focusing on improving the lives of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities by understanding the causes of these disorders and developing and testing therapies tailored to each individual’s precise needs.",Overall: Eunice Kennedy Shriver Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Vanderbilt,10229591,P50HD103537,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Affect', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Down Syndrome', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Research', 'Prevention', 'Problem behavior', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'clinical translation', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug-induced weight gain', 'experience', 'image processing', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'individuals with autism spectrum disorder', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research study', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'translational neuroscience', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,P50,2021,1364066
"Diagnosing and predicting risk in children with SARS-CoV-2- related illness In the wake of COVID-19 pandemic, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) has evolved as a new threat to children exposed to SARS-CoV-2. The emergence of MIS-C is so new and so rapidly evolving that there are currently no diagnostic tests to identify these patients nor are there tools to predict disease progression. Through established, funded, multi-center consortia in the U.S. (CHARMS: Characterization of MIS-C and its Relationship to Kawasaki Disease funded by PCORI) and the UK (DIAMONDS), we will collect clinical data and samples to support the proposed studies. First, we will generate transcript, protein and antibody datasets from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, and with other febrile illnesses. Next, we will use these data to devise tests to distinguish children at risk of progression to severe COVID-19 or MIS-C and diagnostic tests to distinguish these conditions from other causes of fever in children. Continuing our established collaboration with Columbia University, we will define the antibody repertoire against all known human coronaviruses and determine how pre-existing antibody to other coronaviruses may shape the immune response in acute SARS-CoV-2 infection and MIS-C. The first two years (R61) will build on the expertise of the assembled teams to discover unique proteomic and transcriptomic patterns in MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2- infected patients and relate clinical parameters to the antibody response to coronaviral antigens profiled on peptide arrays. This work will leverage already banked plasma, serum, and RNA samples from children with COVID-19, MIS-C, Kawasaki disease and other inflammatory conditions. Rigorous Go/NoGo criteria have been established and will determine progression to the R33 phase. The final two years (R33) will focus on platform development and multicenter and bi-national test validation to diagnose and predict severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection or MIS-C based on aptamer technology, lateral-flow protein detection, point-of-service RNA or antibody profiling with commercial partners. De-identified clinical and molecular data will be deposited in the RADx-rad hub to facilitate data sharing. Many potential hurdles in this type of research have already been overcome: a) IRB-approved patient recruitment for data and samples is on-going, b) clinical samples have been banked, c) strong preliminary data has been generated on RNAseq, aptamer proteomics, and coronaviral antibody responses, and d) the teams have a strong track record of previous collaboration and productivity. The synergistic expertise of these investigative teams in this multi-center proposal provides a unique opportunity to create diagnostic and prognostic tools for children suffering from the spectrum of SARS- CoV-2 illnesses. 1 Project Narrative As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved in early 2020, case reports appeared describing children with unusual febrile illnesses with elevated inflammatory markers and multi-system involvement that is now termed Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C). The illness occurs weeks following exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and these children have a wide spectrum of disease severity ranging from cardiogenic shock to milder illness that can be self-limited. To address an urgent, unmet clinical need, investigative teams across three countries will join forces to discover and validate a diagnostic test to identify children with MIS-C and predict progression of disease.",Diagnosing and predicting risk in children with SARS-CoV-2- related illness,10271147,R61HD105590,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age-Months', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antibody Response', 'Antibody-Dependent Enhancement', 'Antigens', 'Aptamer Technology', 'Attenuated', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Burn injury', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'California', 'Cardiogenic Shock', 'Case Study', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Coronavirus', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Fever', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Industrialization', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Liquid Chromatography', 'London', 'Measures', 'Metadata', 'Molecular', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'RADx Radical', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 antibody', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'college', 'comorbidity', 'data sharing', 'human coronavirus', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning method', 'pediatrician', 'predictive signature', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'response', 'severe COVID-19', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'testing services', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'two-dimensional', 'vaccine development']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R61,2021,698415
"IL-18 Signaling and Lung Epithelial Cell Barrier Integrity in Severe Asthma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  Asthma is a common disease, affecting more than 300 million people worldwide. Though well controlled in most, some experience disease that is refractory to standard treatments such as corticosteroids. Recent efforts focused on understanding these severe asthma (SA) patients suggests ontological heterogeneity. Previous work from the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) cohort linked epithelial gene signature to clinical phenotype. We revisited this data set and identified 3 novel groups of asthmatics, one of which housing the majority of SA cases and having the worst lung function and greatest exacerbation history. Using principal drivers of variance in the data set, we found that expression of the interleukin 18 receptor (IL18R1) along with 18 other genes was able identify at-risk asthmatics. IL18R1 has been previously linked to asthma in genome-wide association studies. Its ligand, interleukin-18 (IL-18), may be a cofactor for both Th1 and Th2 inflammation. High IL-18 levels have been detected in serum and sputum of asthmatics including in those with fatal asthma. Importantly, IL-18 and IL18R1 regulate epithelial barrier function in other inflammatory conditions. We have confirmed an increase in IL18R1 at the protein level in SA patients compared to healthy controls (HC) using lung biopsies from very severe asthma cases. These SA patients also harbor increased numbers IL-18+ cells, the cognate ligand for IL18R1. Downstream targets of IL18 stimulation, including the active phosphorylated forms of JNK1 and c-Jun, show increase in SA airway epithelium. SA patients also show disorganization of adherens junctions, suggesting breakdown in epithelial barrier integrity.  Based on this background and our preliminary data, we hypothesize that IL-18 pathway activation, via elevated IL18R1 expression in bronchial epithelium, promotes dysregulated barrier function that contributes to SA pathobiology by increasing immune cell access to foreign antigens. We propose 2 aims to address this: Aim 1. We will interrogate pre-existing tissue banks for quantitative analysis of IL18R1 and compare that with levels of its ligand in tissue and fluids from these patients. These data will be corroborated with activity of associated signaling pathways and tight/adherens junction integrity. Aim 2. We will us primary human airway epithelial cells, obtained bronchoscopically from HCs and asthmatic patients to mechanistically confirm and expand upon the results from Aim 1. This will include validation of ex vivo results as well as quantification of barrier function.  These data will identify a novel role for IL18 in severe asthma pathogenesis and open up new avenues for treatment of this difficult and costly disease. The activities of the project will provide the PI with valuable experience in obtaining, culturing and manipulating primary human airway epithelial cells and lay the foundation for future in vivo work by integrating study in computational biology and immunology. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Severe asthma is disease with tremendous impact on patient quality of life and significant cost of treatment. We have used machine learning to identify the IL-18 pathway as a potential driver of this disease which may one day be targeted for novel treatments. Thus, we propose confirmation of these findings using an extensive ex vivo tissue collection as well as mechanistic validation using primary human airway epithelial cells to lay groundwork for future in vivo study.",IL-18 Signaling and Lung Epithelial Cell Barrier Integrity in Severe Asthma,10116175,F32HL147415,"['Address', 'Adherens Junction', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Allergens', 'Antigens', 'Asthma', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Cells', 'Collection', 'Computational Biology', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'E-Cadherin', 'Electrical Resistance', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'IL18 gene', 'Immune', 'Immunofluorescence Microscopy', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interleukin-18', 'JUN gene', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'MAP Kinase Gene', 'MAPK8 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Ontology', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Sputum', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tight Junctions', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Transcription Factor AP-1', 'Treatment Cost', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Western Blotting', 'Work', 'airway epithelium', 'asthma exacerbation', 'asthmatic', 'asthmatic airway', 'asthmatic patient', 'base', 'bronchial epithelium', 'clinical phenotype', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'genetic signature', 'genome wide association study', 'in vivo', 'interleukin-18 receptor', 'novel', 'occludin', 'p38 Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'response', 'standard care', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F32,2021,52121
"Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array PROJECT SUMMARY COVID-19 presents a public health emergency: There is a critical need for rapid, not reagent intensive, non- invasive testing technologies. This program will lead to the production of a prototype system to diagnose COVID-19 infection using the body odor signature of the disease. Our goal is to maximize societal impact by creating a validated prototype that can be used in a community or workplace setting by minimally trained personnel for low-cost, on-the-spot diagnosis within minutes. The system will be developed in a manner that puts it on a pathway for rapid FDA approval. The Research Aims are: Aim 1. Optimization, assembly, and integration of a prototype system with the ability to odor signature of COVID-19 in samples of body odor. The system will be simple to use, pose essentially zero risk to the operator and the test subject, and report a result within minutes. The production cost at scale will be approximately $9,000 for the complete measurement system, with a per test cost of approximately $0.50. The design and construction of the prototype will be conducted by Novo Engineering, a leading firm with extensive experience in medical device development. Aim 2. Software development. Software for the system from VOC sampling to final diagnostic result will be developed to ensure error-free operation of the device. Our preliminary results suggest that simple linear discriminant analysis (LDA) does an excellent job of classifying VOCs from human body odor as COVID-19 positive or negative (92% sensitivity and 87% specificity). Optimization of the sensor array (Aim 1) and use of richer feature sets in our classifier models will lead to further performance improvements in the prototype system. Aim 3. System Benchmarking and Validation. We will benchmark the full prototype system against a number of VOC mixtures, with and without in vitro skin models. The system will undergo extensive testing against body odor samples from individuals with pathological conditions other than COVID-19 and other sources of potentially confounding VOCs. The prototype will be validated against 1000 samples drawn from the COVID-SAFE program at Penn. The screening will include all members of the Penn community, and represents incredible racial and ethnic diversity as well as a wide variance in age, sex, and gender. Aim 4. Regulatory Approval Plan The plan will be developed under the direction of Sr/Key personnel John Fuson, JD, an attorney at Crowell & Moring LLP and a former Associate Chief Counsel at FDA. Novo Engineering has extensive experience in guiding prototype design in alignment with the requirements for FDA approval. The proposed COVID-19 VOC-based testing device will be regulated by the FDA, likely as a Class I or II medical device. Because there is no clear predicate device to reference in this case, we intend to submit a direct de novo petition to FDA asking the agency to categorize and clear the proposed COVID-19 testing device as Class I or Class II without reference to any predicate. PROJECT NARRATIVE This program addresses the critical unmet need of an effective means to screen for COVID-19 infection, and potentially other novel virus infections, in a community setting based upon the body odor signature of the disease. The program will result in a validated prototype system, with a test time of minutes, a test cost of approximately $0.50, on a path to rapid FDA approval.","Effective, Reagent-free Detection of the Odor Signature of Covid-19 Infection Using a Nano-Enabled Sensor Array",10266403,U18TR003775,"['Address', 'Age', 'Astronomy', 'Benchmarking', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 screening', 'COVID-19 testing', 'Carbon Nanotubes', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Florida', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Housekeeping', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Human body', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Information Sciences', 'International', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Lawyers', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measurement', 'Mechanics', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Nose', 'Occupations', 'Odors', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Production', 'RADx', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 negative', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Skin', 'Software Engineering', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visual', 'Workplace', 'animal care', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'community setting', 'coronavirus disease', 'cost', 'design', 'design and construction', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'high standard', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'nano', 'nanosensors', 'next generation', 'novel virus', 'operation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health emergency', 'racial diversity', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sensor', 'sex', 'software development', 'software systems', 'vapor', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,U18,2021,999830
"RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY The research project outlined in this SBIR submission will develop the Realize, Analyze, Engage (RAE) platform into a tool to promote sustained recovery in individuals receiving treatment for substance use disorder. In this proposal, the investigators intend to deploy the RAE system- consisting of a wearable sensor, a smartphone app, and a clinical portal- to provide individuals in recovery and their treatment providers with an opportunity to identify moments of high risk for relapse and to access real time intervention opportunities. Wearable biosensors are small, noninvasive devices that continuously record physiology. These sensors have the ability to detect digital biomarkers of drug use and stress, the latter of which herald an increased risk of relapse. RAE aims to utilize this capability to create a real-time solution for individuals in recovery. The components of RAE are: 1) The Empatica Embrace, a wrist mounted sensor similar in form factor to a smart watch, that continuously monitors skin temperature, electrodermal activity (EDA) and locomotion. Detection algorithms for stress and drug use will be embedded on the Embrace firmware. 2) The RAE smartphone application (app), for the individual in recovery. The app will be triggered either by detection of an event on the Embrace or manually by the user when needed and will provide multiple options for annotations, stress reduction techniques and immediate contact with individuals in the pre-defined support system via call or SMS text. The app will also log sleep, physical activity, and geographic location of events. 3) The RAE Portal, for the treatment provider, will deliver immediate alerts when an event is detected on the user’s device for the opportunity to intervene in real time and will also provide metrics on the user’s recorded activities. The research plan has two Specific Aims: Aim 1) To deploy and optimize the RAE system in a population of individuals in treatment for substance use disorder and Aim 2) To demonstrate the impact of the RAE system on outcomes in substance use treatment. To achieve these aims the investigators will first deploy the technology in a population of individuals in recovery and collect data on accuracy, usability and functionality (Aim 1). The data from Aim 1 will be used to optimize the system and achieve millstones prior to transition to Aim 2 which will include sensitivity, specify, accuracy and user compliance targets. The investigators will then undertake a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (Aim 2) to evaluate the efficacy of RAE on key outcomes including rates of relapse, retention in treatment programs, and psychosocial wellbeing. The investigators have assembled a leadership team and advisory team with the necessary expertise in business, medicine, wearable technology and engineering to develop RAE into a tool that dramatically improves the success of treatment for substance use disorder, promotes sustained sobriety, and reduces morbidity and mortality from relapse to substance use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to substance use disorder has reached staggering proportions, and treatment options suffer from high rates of relapse. RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage) is a mobile based solution that combines a wearable sensor, a smartphone app and a cloud based clinical portal to detect stress and drug use in individuals in treatment for substance use disorder. The goal of the RAE system is to provide real-time intervention tools for patients, to allow clinicians to personalize the treatment approach for each patient, and ultimately to reduce morbidity and mortality from substance use disorder by improving the success of treatment programs.","RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders",10356481,R44DA046151,"['Advisory Committees', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological Markers', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'Journals', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposition', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin Temperature', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'User Compliance', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wrist', 'active method', 'addiction', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'craving', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy evaluation', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'randomized controlled study', 'relapse risk', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'sobriety', 'software development', 'stress management', 'stress reduction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance use treatment', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,"CONTINUEYOU, LLC",R44,2021,739128
"The Impacts of Mitigation Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in American Indian Communities OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Summary/Abstract The Impacts of Mitigation Strategies to Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in American Indian Communities Very little is known about the impact of locally-mandated COVID-19 mitigation policies such as Non- Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) on the health and wellbeing of medically and economically vulnerable populations such as American Indians (AI) living in rural tribal lands. There is an urgent need to evaluate the effect of already implemented measures on the spread of COVID-19, the social and economic impact of those measures in these communities, and the potential spillover effects on non-AIAN communities. The staggered nature of the NPI implementation in tribal lands and the independence of sovereign nations’ policy decisions from local (e.g. county-level) policies present a unique quasi-natural experiment in policy timing, allowing us to study spillover effects from tribal NPIs to connected non-tribal areas. Our research efforts seek to improve American Indian health by understanding and evaluating these NPI measures on an NIH-designated disparity community. This R01 proposal has four specific aims: (1) Identify whether COVID-19 cases and deaths are related to the early closure of American Indian reservations and/or tribal casinos among Native and non-Native populations living on and off of adjacent reservation lands. (2) Identify the change in commuter patterns and movement behaviors as a result of NPIs. (3) Use in-time claims data to analyze how the implementation of NPIs and the progression of the epidemic affected utilization of different non-COVID-19 health care services and facilities. (4) Conduct a survey of American Indians living in rural areas to create a new primary data resource and cross-validate the results we obtain through analysis of secondary data of cell phone traffic flows. The long- term goal of this proposal is to develop and validate analytical tools that could be applied with large secondary datasets to aid the evaluation and design of public policies to address public health emergencies in AI populations. Our central hypothesis is that the timely implementation of tribal NPIs reduced the incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in AI communities and in traffic-connected areas. However, we also expect that the secondary effects of NPIs, such as economic hardship and under-utilization of non-COVID-related health care, would be stronger on tribal lands. We will use an innovative two-pronged approach to combine empirical analysis of secondary big data sources with primary data collection to provide robust evidence on the current and future effects of these policies. This proposal is significant because the impact of COVID-19 and related policies on tribal communities is under-researched, under-funded, and not well understood, and yet relevant not only for AI tribal policies and populations but for regional health and economic policies. Our research is guided by the C.A.R.E. Principles of Indigenous Data Governance developed by our team members. It is innovative because it applies techniques from economics, computer science and public health to deliver actionable results and recommendations for future policy implementation. OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION – Project Narrative The COVID-19 pandemic and associated mitigation strategies have been shown to disparately impact socially vulnerable and under-served minority groups in the US. This proposed study develops an innovative approach to analyzing the effects of COVID-19 mitigation policies on American Indian populations living on tribal lands and in rural areas, by integrating big data and deep learning techniques with primary data collection.

"Impact of chronic ethanol consumption on lung functional and immunological landscape and implication for susceptibility to SARSCoV2 infection PROJECT SUMMARY As of the submission of this proposal, over 38 million cases of COVID-19 including a million deaths have been reported worldwide. COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that can range from a mild to a severe/fatal disease characterized by excessive lung inflammation, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), coagulopathy, and multi-organ failure. Current studies suggest a major role for myeloid cell subsets in the development and exacerbation of disease, but the precise roles of lung-resident macrophages and infiltrating monocytes in COVID-19 pathogenesis remains poorly understood. It is already well-established that chronic heavy alcohol drinking (CHD) is a significant risk factor for developing ARDS and admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) for patients with pneumonia. CHD is also associated with increased susceptibility to both bacterial and viral pulmonary infections, notably respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), community-acquired pneumonia, and tuberculosis. Defects in epithelial barrier as well as anti-microbial functions of alveolar macrophage are believed to be major causes for increased vulnerability to respiratory diseases in individuals with CHD. Despite the clear association between CHD and increased risk of severe pulmonary infections, no studies to date have examined the impact of CHD on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. In this application, we propose to test the hypothesis that chronic alcohol drinking alters lung-resident myeloid cells leading to exacerbated inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 with reduced viral clearance. To test this hypothesis, we will leverage a rhesus macaque model of voluntary ethanol self- administration that accurately mirrors human physiology and recapitulates complex human drinking behavior. Using this model, we recently demonstrated that CHD results in transcriptional and epigenetic rewiring of circulating monocytes and splenic macrophages, resulting in aberrant inflammatory responses. Additional preliminary studies show enhanced production of inflammatory factors with reduced type I IFN response to RSV infection as well as decreased phagocytic capacity of alveolar macrophages in CHD animals. We will first examine the impact of CHD on the phenotypic, functional and transcriptional landscape of lung-resident immune cells. Then, we will examine the impact of CHD on the response of lung-resident immune cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Completion of these experiments will allow us to define CHD-mediated differences in the lung immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection that modulate COVID19 disease progression and severity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, can result in severe lung pathologies and inflammatory cytokine storms in individuals with underlying health conditions. Chronic heavy alcohol use and misuse increases risk for several lung infection, but whether CHD is a risk factor for COVID-19 disease remains unknown. The proposed research aims to identify the impact of chronic alcohol consumption on immune response to SARS-CoV-2.",Impact of chronic ethanol consumption on lung functional and immunological landscape and implication for susceptibility to SARSCoV2 infection,10288563,R01AA028735,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Aging', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohols', 'Alveolar Macrophages', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Area', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 pathogenesis', 'COVID-19 susceptibility', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Ethanol', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Host Defense', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interferon Type I', 'Interferons', 'Interstitial Pneumonia', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung diseases', 'Lung infections', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Myelogenous', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Phagocytes', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Production', 'Pulmonary Pathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Respiratory syncytial virus', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sales', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Shelter facility', 'Stress', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Tuberculosis', 'Viral', 'Virus Diseases', 'alcohol misuse', 'antimicrobial', 'chronic alcohol ingestion', 'community acquired pneumonia', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'drinking behavior', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'insight', 'lung injury', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'public health relevance', 'pulmonary function', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistics', 'synergism', 'theories', 'thrombotic complications']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2021,69281
"Clinical prediction and epigenetic regulation of asthma and rhinitis Asthma and rhinitis share a strong genetic component and are the most common chronic respiratory diseases worldwide affecting 339 million and 500 million people, respectively. Both allergic and non-allergic rhinitis are well-studied risk factors for the development of asthma, independent of atopy and IgE sensitization, and up to 80% of asthmatics have concomitant rhinitis. Conversely, asthma is also a risk factor for the development of rhinitis suggesting a common pathophysiological link between the upper and lower airways. Individuals with comorbid asthma and rhinitis are more likely to experience frequent and severe asthma exacerbations. Currently, an unmet need exists in the understanding of the comorbid development of asthma and rhinitis, including which patients are at risk and why patients with comorbid disease have increased disease severity. microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important predictive biomarkers and regulators of the pathogenesis of asthma and rhinitis. However, the role of miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) regulatory networks in asthma with comorbid rhinitis is not known. The overall hypothesis of this K23 award proposal is that the comorbid development of asthma and rhinitis can be predicted by clinical factors and is regulated by miRNA-mRNA networks. Specific Aim 1 will evaluate the early childhood clinical prediction of the development of comorbid disease in the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) and Children, Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiology (BAMSE) cohorts and create a validated clinical prognostic tool to identify high-risk children who may benefit from early monitoring and interventions. Specific Aim 2 will identify the unique miRNA-mRNA pathways and regulatory networks in the peripheral blood that regulate asthma with comorbid rhinitis in children from the VDAART, BAMSE, and Childhood Asthma Management Program (CAMP) cohorts to identify candidate miRNAs and biological pathways that may serve as future targets of miRNA-based therapies and biomarkers. Specific Aim 3 will prospectively validate the miRNA-mRNA signature of asthma with comorbid rhinitis across the peripheral whole blood and local nasal epithelium in subjects recruited from Brigham and Women’s Hospital to identify the shared and tissue-specific pathogenic pathways in the peripheral blood and local primary airway tissue. Through this K23 award proposal, the candidate will complete an integrated plan of mentorship, coursework, conferences, patient-oriented research, statistical and computational analyses, manuscript submissions, and R01 grant preparation. She will develop new knowledge and skills in clinical, translational, and computational research and generate new hypotheses and data that will provide the basis for future independent lines of investigation. With the support of her division, mentors, and scientific advisory committee and the resources available at her institution, the candidate is ideally positioned to achieve her goal of becoming a successful independent investigator in the epidemiology and epigenetics of asthma and allergic diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Asthma and rhinitis frequently coexist and are the most common respiratory diseases globally, yet it remains unknown why these two diseases often develop concomitantly and why patients with comorbid disease have worse control of asthma symptoms and more frequent and severe asthma exacerbations.

"A Chatbot Utilizing Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing to Implement the Brief Negotiation Interview to Improve Engagement in Buprenorphine Treatment among Justice-Involved Individuals Project Summary/Abstract This Administrative Supplement proposes the participation of a 3-member team from the Center for Progressive Recovery, LLC (CPR) in the Innovation Corps (I-Corps™), an intensive, 8-week program focused on developing a successful commercialization plan and business model for technology-driven start-ups funded by NIH’s SBIR Phase I mechanism. The program would entail training, as well as structure and accountability around conducting 100 interviews with key stakeholders and others whose expertise would inform the company’s plans. The SBIR Phase I award to CPR (the small business concern, SBC) that this application is predicated on addresses the problem that the people at the greatest risk of dying from an opioid overdose are the least likely to get life-saving medication. Justice- involved individuals coming out of prison have the highest risk of death by overdose (8x greater than the general population), yet only 1 in 20 of these individuals receive buprenorphine (bup), a safe, effective medication that has been shown to reduce a person’s risk of death by overdose by half. There is an urgent need to facilitate an increase in bup treatment engagement among these individuals. Two of the top barriers to receiving bup for this population are 1) system level barriers and, 2) low levels of individual motivation. We will disrupt system level barriers by circumventing the pieces of the probation system that are stigmatizing and reduce the chances of a bup referral with an artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbot. This will be the only tool needed to receive a referral to a bup provider. We will also address low individual motivation with the chatbot by programming it to deliver the efficacious Brief Negotiation Interview (BNI) without the need for a trained human. Our aims are: Aim 1: Design and develop a prototype chatbot to motivate bup engagement. Milestones: (a) human-centered design (HCD) interviews with key stakeholders; and (b) creation of a chatbot using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) that is integrated with a mobile application; Aim 2: Conduct a 4-week pilot study with 60 probationers randomly assigned to the BNI Chatbot or Digital Resources (i.e., Digitally-delivered OUD and buprenorphine education and referral resources). The following 3-member team has deep expertise in developing and bringing to market digital health solutions and was formed to pursue the unique benefits of the I-Corps program. All 3 are able to meet the time-intensive requirements of the training program: 1) Michael V. Pantalon, Ph.D., CEO; 2) Marianne S. Pantalon, Ph.D., PI, and 3) Thomas Wheeler, Industry Expert and CTO.

"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, affecting an estimated 300 million people. Evidence-based treatments are available and measurement-based care has been described as the gold standard. Monitoring of depressive symptoms is currently performed with self-administered and interview- based assessment methods conducted by clinicians in their offices. However, the shortage of mental health specialists and the limited resources available to primary care physicians who often manage patients with depression, prevent close monitoring of symptoms delaying optimal treatment potentially prolonging suffering. Passive recording of behavioral data (gathering information without individual's direct input) has been identified as a potentially feasible method for long-term monitoring of depression. To date, most studies have collected passive behavioral data in ""real time"" through mobile apps (i.e. accelerometer, phone clicks) with the goal of identifying potential markers of depression. However, this method lacks critical biological indicators of depression, including sleep, arousal, and motion. Recent development in wristband sensor technology developed by out lab has allowed to measure physiological parameters like gait, heart rate variability (HRV) and electrodermal activity (EDA) continuously in “real time”, allowing a broader anatomical and neurophysiological understanding of emotion, behavior, and cognition in mood disorders as they occur during routine activity. During the past decade, along with the development of sensors, we have seen the progressive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that enables the detection of complex patterns in multimodal data, allowing the development of complex models. The combination of sensor technology and machine learning allows detailed measurement in real time of a wealth of behaviors predicting mood variation. Over the past 2 years, our interdisciplinary team, including one of the leading lab on depression research, and one of the most innovative lab on affective computing, has conducted a study applying machine learning analytics to create a model combining wristband sensors data and phone- based passive measurements to assess severity of depressive symptoms. In our pilot study with depressed patients monitored over 8 weeks, we found that an algorithm based on biological and behavioral sensor data could estimate depression severity evaluated by a clinician with high accuracy. The proposed study will further refine our model in a sample of 100 adults with depression, assessed over 12 weeks. We anticipate that the proposed study will enable the development of an objective, passive, sensor-based algorithm able to measure depressive symptom severity. The identification of reliable, objective, passive assessment of depressive symptoms with biosensors will have significant ramifications for the monitoring of depression, early detection of response, remission and relapse and ultimately contribute to the advancement of precision medicine. Narrative  The proposed project will create a novel method to assess depressive symptoms by harnessing modern machine learning analytics, phone sensors, and wrist-band sensors. Measurement-based treatment is considered optimal and the development of a valid passive, objective, behavioral and biological assessment of depressive symptoms that does not rely on clinician interviews will improve monitoring and ultimately improve treatment significantly. Ultimately, the ability to leverage a remarkable wealth of behavioral and biological data has the potential to transform the delivery of treatment for depression.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for the assessment of severity of depressive symptoms,10063043,R01MH118274,"['Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biosensor', 'Caring', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease remission', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Emotions', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Melancholias', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Temperature', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'affective computing', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'depressed patient', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'information gathering', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'multimodal data', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'statistical and machine learning', 'wearable device']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,498501
"Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is an effective and easy-to-tolerate treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). TMS is costly and time-intensive so identifying markers of response would reduce financial and psychological burden. Further, treatment response is highly variable. Clinical and diagnostic heterogeneity of depression contributes to significant variability in neural markers of response. The literature on neural markers is complicated by variability in TMS intensity and targets, which may further modify response. Electrical field models estimate the degree to which a target is stimulated by considering both the intensity and structural information of each participant but at this time there are no studies that have investigated the association between brain electrical fields and treatment response. Moreover, the neurobiological correlates of dorsolateral (dlPFC) TMS treatment response are not well understood. Machine learning may be able to help us understand these complex set of features and their association to treatment response. Thus to appropriately personalize treatments, I will develop a data-driven machine learning model that uses the following: (1) pre- treatment resting state connectivity that reflects circuit dysregulation; (2) electrical field modeling to estimate the electrical field or voltage on individual patient’s brain, as a marker of sufficiency of stimulation; and (3) expected target network connectivity as a marker of target engagement. We have previously demonstrated feasibility of machine learning to predict antidepressant response in MDD. We will optimize and expand a model developed on archival University of Toronto data that predicted dlPFC TMS response. We will validate this externally on three sets of data: data we collect at University of Pittsburgh, archival data from Brown University, and sham TMS data. As an exploratory aim, we will identify whether our model that predicts dlPFC TMS treatment response is capable of predicting response to dmPFC TMS stimulation. During my PhD in Bioengineering, I developed kernel-based machine learning models to personalize neural networks markers of antidepressant response. Given the clinical and neural heterogeneity of depression, I will leverage my machine learning and neuroimaging experience by receiving training in advanced optimization approaches and depression neurobiology to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments. This will allow me to develop optimized models of treatment response and facilitate my long-term career goal to develop personalized treatment algorithms using large-scale data. My previous experiences in machine learning, bioengineering, neuroimaging, as well as the preliminary understanding of depression uniquely position me to maximize the benefits of training aims outlined in this proposal. 1 This is a K01 application designed to develop a data-driven machine learning model that will take into account several neural markers of response to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). The application proposes expanded training in machine learning optimization approaches and depression neurobiology for the applicant, who has a PhD in Bioengineering. The goal of the study is to identify stable, reproducible neural predictors of TMS treatment response to achieve clinically translatable personalized treatments, which matches the candidate’s long-term goal to conduct research on and develop models that personalize medicine for depression. 1",Machine Learning Models for Identifying Neural Predictors of TMS Treatment Response in MDD,10125330,K01MH122741,"['Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Archives', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Placebos', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Universities', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'career', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'electric field', 'executive function', 'experience', 'individual patient', 'large scale data', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging', 'personalized medicine', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'random forest', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'support vector machine', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response', 'voltage']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2021,170027
"Center for Machine Learning in Urology PROJECT SUMMARY We propose to establish an Exploratory Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Benign Urology at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), the central mission of which is to apply machine learning to improve the understanding of the pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and prediction of treatment responses of benign urological disease among children and adults. The proposed CHOP/Penn Center for Machine Learning in Urology (CMLU) addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede the development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. Structurally, urologic research occurs in silos, with little interaction among investigators that study different diseases or different populations (e.g. pediatric and adult). Scientifically, analysis of imaging and other types complex data is limited by inter-observer variability, and incomplete utilization of available information. This proposal overcomes these barriers by applying cutting-edge approaches in machine learning to analyze CT images that are routinely obtained for evaluation of individuals with kidney stone disease. Central to the CHOP/Penn CMLU is the partnership of urologists and experts in machine learning, which will bring a new approach to generating knowledge that advances research and clinical care. In addition, the CMLU will expand the urologic research community by providing a research platform and standalone machine learning executables that could be applied to other datasets. The Center’s mission will be achieved through the following Aims, with progress assessed through systematic evaluation: Aim 1. To expand the research base investigating benign urological disease. We will establish a community with the research base, particularly with the KURe, UroEpi programs, other P20 Centers, and O’Brien Centers. We will build this community by providing mini-coaching clinics to facilitate application of machine learning to individual projects, developing an educational hub for synchronous and asynchronous engagement with the research base, and making freely available all source codes and standalone executables for all machine learning tools. Aim 2. To improve prediction of ureteral stone passage using machine learning of CT images. The CMLU has developed deep learning methods that segment and automate measurement of urinary stones and adjacent renal anatomy. In the Research Project, we will compare these methods to existing segmentation methods and the current gold standard of manual measurement. We will then extract informative features from thousands of CT scans to predict the probability of spontaneous passage of ureteral stones for children and adults evaluated in the CHOP and Penn healthcare systems. Aim 3. To foster collaboration in benign urological disease research across levels of training and centers through an Educational Enrichment Program. We will amplify interactions across institutions and engage investigators locally and nationally by providing summer research internships, and interinstitutional exchange program, and an annual research symposium. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed CHOP/Penn O’Brien Center for Machine Learning in Urology addresses critical structural and scientific barriers that impede development of new treatments and the effective application of existing treatments for benign urologic disease across the lifespan. This application overcomes these barriers by applying cutting- edge approaches in machine learning to analyze complex imaging data for individuals with kidney stone disease.The Center’s strategic vision of using machine learning to generate knowledge that improves diagnosis, risk stratification strategies, and prediction of outcomes among children and adults will be achieved through the implementation of a Educational Enrichment Program and a Research Project.",Center for Machine Learning in Urology,10260577,P20DK127488,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Benign', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internships', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Patient Care', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pennsylvania', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Site', 'Source Code', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologist', 'Urology', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical care', 'complex data', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'human error', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'programs', 'risk stratification', 'routine imaging', 'senior faculty', 'skills', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'tool', 'urologic', 'web page']",NIDDK,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,P20,2021,332101
"AICORE-kids: Artificial Intelligence COVID-19 Risk AssEssment for kids This work is directed at characterizing pediatric COVID-19 and stratifying incoming patients by projected (future) disease severity. Such stratification has several implications: immediately improving treatment planning, and as disease mechanistic pathways are uncovered, directing treatment. Predicting future severity will inform the risks of outpatient treatment; to the patients themselves, their family, other caregivers/cohabitants, and to schools and employers. As varying levels of “reopening” are adopted across the country (and the world), such prognostication will inform policy on the handling of pediatric carriers in the community. Based on our preliminary analysis we assert that a combination of novel assays including quantitative serology inflammatory markers (cytokine/chemokine profiles, immune profiles), transcriptomics, epigenomics, longitudinal physiological monitoring, time series analysis, imaging, radiomics and clinical observation including social determinants of health, contains adequate information even at early stages of infection to stratify the disease and predict disease severity. We propose an artificial intelligence/machine learning approach to integrate this rich and heterogeneous dataset, characterize the spectrum of disease and identify biosignatures that predict severity in progressive disease. To facilitate translation of the approaches developed in this work to a wide user community, we incorporate a Translational Development function, to oversee the design-control process and ensure readiness of our methods for regulatory review. Incorporated into our timelines are appropriate regulatory milestones intended to conform with the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) programs in effect for SARS- CoV-2 diagnostics.

"Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system Project Summary/Abstract This SBIR Phase I project will develop a deep learning-based algorithm to analyze the sound of blood flow in mature arterio-venous (AV) fistulas used for hemodialysis access. This monitoring tool can help to identify fistulas with impending failure in patients who are in need of surgical intervention to ensure patency of the patient’s hemodialysis access. The specific aims of the study are (1) to create the world’s first deep learning-scale database of mature AV fistula sounds paired with ultrasound imaging from hemodialysis patients, and (2) develop and evaluate the performance of a deep learning classification model trained via semi-supervised learning to discriminate between patients with patent fistulas and patients with failing fistulas. By integrating this deep learning algorithm into Eko’s mobile and cloud software platform, we anticipate this algorithm will enable better monitoring for failing fistulas. During Phase I of the project we will recruit study subjects in vascular surgery and interventional radiology clinics at Columbia University Medical Center. The follow-up SBIR Phase II project will extend our algorithm to account for (1) broader forms of hemodialysis access including AV grafts, which often fail more frequently than fistulas, and premature fistulas, which are often abandoned, and (2) longitudinal collection and analysis of hemodialysis access sounds at commercial dialysis centers and in patients’ homes. SBIR Project Narrative In creating the world’s largest annotated dataset of mature AV fistula sounds and corresponding ultrasounds, Eko will gain unprecedented insights into fistula blood flow. We expect this to advance our scientific understanding of the fluid dynamics of fistulas, and help explain how and why hemodialysis access fails at such a high rate over time. A clinical decision support algorithm trained from this dataset can help healthcare systems detect fistula failures earlier, leading to more timely interventions that can avert costly complications, prolong life expectancy, and improve quality of life for hemodialysis patients as their care transitions from clinic to home care.",Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system,10255460,R43DK129107,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auscultation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Bluetooth', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Eko', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Fistula', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Sounds', 'Hemodialysis', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Life Expectancy', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicare', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Research Design', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stethoscopes', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'algorithm training', 'analog', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cloud software', 'commercialization', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data streams', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'patient home care', 'premature', 'recruit', 'skills', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NIDDK,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R43,2021,299358
"AC/DC: Artificial intelligence and Computer visioning to assess Dietary Composition ABSTRACT Dietary intake is a complex human behavior that drives disease risk and corresponding economic and healthcare burdens worldwide. Poor diet is the leading cause of death in the US and a known driver of obesity – a global epidemic. A major contributor to poor diet is food eaten away from home, such as restaurant foods. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods. Accurate approaches and tools to evaluate food and nutrient intake are essential in monitoring the nutritional status of individuals. There is a critical need for real-time data capture that minimizes burden and reduces error. While progress has been made, there is no tool available that accurately and automatically estimates foods left unconsumed in a meal. Two major limitations of existing systems is the reliance of a fiducial marker for food detection and volume estimation, and reliance on humans – either the respondent or a trained researcher – to estimate the portion of food leftover. This application leverages novel technology to remove those limitations. The long-term research goal is to utilize digital imaging (DI), artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision (CV) techniques to develop a novel hybrid methodology for rapid, accurate measurement of dietary intake. To attain this goal, our objective in this R21 application is to refine and test a system architecture that (a) uses digital images to record dietary intake in real-time and (b) uses AI and CV techniques to identify food/beverage items and determine amounts leftover. We plan to build on our current prototype in which digital food images are captured before and after the meal, analyzed to detect the food items, a three-dimensional (3-D) virtual model constructed, and volume remaining after the meal estimated, which will be used to calculate the amount leftover based on the initial volume. Volume consumed will be converted to weight and linked to public-use nutrition information. These calorie estimates will be compared against calories those from (a) DIs coded by trained research staff and (b) weighed plate waste methodology. Our expectation is to develop a valid system architecture for rapidly estimating dietary intake. The outcome of this proposal is expected to have a significant positive impact, enabling nutrition and health researchers to collect high-quality food consumption data in real world settings, increasing knowledge of dietary patterns and improving capacity to assess dietary interventions. This work will lead to an R01 application that will expand food types and meal settings and test the utility of our system among consumers. Project Narrative Solutions to address the global obesity epidemic are urgently needed. Research has shown that tracking one’s weight and dietary intake significantly improve success toward weight loss and maintenance goals; however, this type of tracking is burdensome, prone to error, and difficult to estimate for restaurant foods, a known driver of obesity. This study integrates nutrition science, computer science, and engineering to develop and test a new method for assessing dietary intake, and if successful would yield a rapid, reliable, accurate and cost- effective tool.",AC/DC: Artificial intelligence and Computer visioning to assess Dietary Composition,10163822,R21CA250024,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Beverages', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet Records', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary Practices', 'Dietary intake', 'Economics', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Food', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Science', 'Nutritional status', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Respondent', 'Restaurants', 'Side', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unhealthy Diet', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'dietary', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'food consumption', 'food quality', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'prototype', 'success', 'system architecture', 'tool', 'virtual model', 'wasting', 'weight maintenance']",NCI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R21,2021,197745

"Identifying treatment responders in medication trials for AUD using machine learning approaches ABSTRACT Alcohol use disorder (AUD), as defined in DSM-5, represents a highly prevalent, costly, and often untreated condition in the United States. Pharmacotherapy offers a promising avenue for treating AUD and for improving clinical outcomes for this debilitating disorder. While developing novel medications to treat AUD remains a high priority research area, there remain major opportunities to further elucidate clinical response in completed medication trials. To that end, a key question in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) is which patients respond to a given pharmacotherapy. Identifying treatment responders provides major opportunities to advance clinical care for AUD by personalizing medication practices on the bases of variables/predictors of good clinical response. For example, while the effect size for medications such as naltrexone is deemed small-to-moderate, a host of studies over the past decade have shown that its effect size may be considerably larger for certain subgroups of patients. Towards advancing precision medicine for AUD and leveraging data from a host of carefully conducted RCTs for AUD, this R03 application seeks to conduct secondary data analysis. Specifically, we propose to analyze data from four RCTs conducted by the NIAAA Clinical Investigations Group (NCIG). These state-of-the-art RCTs for AUD have tested the following pharmacotherapies: (a) quetiapine, (b) Levetiracetam XR (Keppra XR®), (c) Varenicline (Chantix®), and (d) HORIZANT® (Gabapentin Enacarbil) Extended-Release. In this R03 application, we propose to use a machine learning approach to identify treatment responders in the NCIG RCTs. Machine learning represents a highly promising and underutilized data analytic strategy in the field of AUD treatment response. Machine learning models prioritize the ability to predict future outcomes over creating perfectly fitting models for the data at hand. This results in models which are more generalizable to future observations, which fits well with our goal of identifying responders in RCTs. Leveraging data from these pivotal RCTs through secondary data analysis and using novel analytic methods, namely machine learning, provides a cost-effective approach to identifying AUD pharmacotherapy responders.

"Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and the leading cause of global disease burden. Associated with over 1,000 different symptom profiles, MDD is highly heterogeneous. The majority of MDD symptom change occurs across hours. Consequently, there is a need to increasingly focus MDD research on personalized assessment of these rapid symptom fluctuations. To date, personalized models of MDD have shown promise, but relied solely on self-report measures. There is thus a critical need to develop personalized models of MDD that incorporate objective signals. Passively collected information from smartphones and wearable sensors can continuously and unobtrusively track behavioral and physiological signals related to core disturbances associated with MDD, including psychomotor retardation, sleep disturbances, social contact, behavioral activation, heart rate variability, and screen time. Preliminary data suggest that personalized artificial intelligence (i.e., personally weighted deep learning models) are well suited for creating novel personalized digital biomarkers of these passive indicators, and that these biomarkers can predict rapid changes in MDD symptoms. This proposal will investigate the ability to develop personalized deep learning models of rapid changes in MDD symptoms among a nationally representative sample of 120 treatment seeking adults with MDD across 90 days using passively collected data from smartphones and wearable sensors. This proposal aims to test the accuracy of personalized, subtyped, and cohort-based modeling techniques and uncover personalized digital biomarkers of moment-to-moment changes in MDD symptoms. The project proposes the following innovations: it will (1) conduct the first passive-sensing study of MDD in a nationally-representative cohort; (2) utilize deep learning models to aid in the discovery of novel maintenance factors of MDD symptom changes; and (3) use personalized multimodal assessments of MDD to address the heterogeneity in MDD. In line with the aims of the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), this project will study MDD symptom changes across multiple units of analysis and integrate multiple systems. This study will provide a critical step towards uncovering novel personalized maintenance patterns of MDD symptom changes in daily life. Further, it will allow for scalable personalized treatments to be developed using technology to deliver behavioral interventions in the moments immediately preceding rapid MDD symptom changes. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to utilize personalized artificial intelligence techniques and objective data (collected from smartphones and wearable devices) to create individualized digital biomarkers of rapid changes in major depressive disorder symptoms. This is important because, if we were to uncover personalized patterns between objectively measured physiology and behavioral changes and understand their resulting impact on rapid fluctuations in major depressive disorder symptoms, we would be able to define new, person-specific maintenance patterns that underlie the wide-ranging heterogeneity that is currently seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder. Moreover, these advancements will provide a crucial step forward towards developing personalized, scalable, technology-based interventions that will be able to be delivered immediately (and, ideally, before rapid symptom changes) among those persons with major depressive disorder.",Personalized Deep Learning Models of Rapid Changes in Major Depressive Disorder Symptoms using Passive Sensor Data from Smartphones and Wearable Devices,10229551,R01MH123482,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arousal', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Devices', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Fostering', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Negative Valence', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Photoplethysmography', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Subgroup', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'analog', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'burden of illness', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'disability', 'heart rate variability', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'microphone', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phenomenological models', 'premature', 'prevent', 'sensor', 'social', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tv watching', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R01,2021,173784
"Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, there are nearly 13,000 patients waitlisted for liver transplant, yet only two-thirds will receive a transplant, and in 2018 approximately 2,500 patients died or were removed from the waitlist due to medical deterioration. This shortage of donor livers available for transplant has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are higher risk than typical donor livers but may be safely transplantable in carefully selected recipients. These include older donors (>70 years), steatotic livers, and livers procured through donation after cardiac death. Due to their riskiness, these marginal livers are often declined, yet as many as 84% of patients who died on the transplant waitlist declined one or more marginal livers prior to death. In light of this, certain waitlisted candidates might have derived a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a marginal organ rather than remaining on the waitlist (i.e. they would have survived longer after a transplant with a marginal liver than they would have survived on the waitlist). Currently, decisions about whether a particular marginal liver is suitable for a particular candidate are based on clinical gestalt or simple subgroup analysis using traditional regression models, which likely do not fully approximate the complex interactions between donor, recipient, and transplant factors. To account for this, we will utilize machine learning (which can incorporate complex, higher-order interactions) to predict whether a specific candidate would derive a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a specific marginal liver, and interview transplant candidates and surgeons to understand how best to translate these predictions into an immediately clinically-useful decision aid. To accomplish this, we will leverage Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) national data (n=293,140) and use a machine technique (random forests) to address the following aims: (1) To predict waitlist survival for waitlisted liver transplant candidates; (2) To predict post-transplant survival for liver transplant recipients of a marginal liver; and (3) To create a decision aid that compares predicted waitlist survival and predicted post-transplant survival for a specific transplant candidates with marginal liver. These aims are highly feasible given our group’s expertise in liver transplantation, analysis of national registry data, and machine learning techniques. We hypothesize that utilizing SRTR and machine learning, we can accurately predict post-transplant survival for a particular candidate with a particular marginal liver, as well as waitlist survival for that same candidate without a liver. We also hypothesize that our decision aid could be utilized in real-time to inform clinical decision-making. If the proposed aims are achieved, our decision aid could be utilized to improve clinical practice by bringing high-quality risk prediction directly to patients and transplant professionals to directly inform the real-time clinical decision of whether a candidate should undergo transplant with a marginal liver. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are far fewer donor livers available for transplant than patients who need them, which has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are riskier than typical donor livers but yet might still provide a benefit to carefully selected patients. However, the decision to use a particular marginal liver for a particular patient is based largely on clinical gestalt or traditional clinical studies, which likely do not account for the complex relationships between donor, recipient, and transplant characteristics. To optimally inform the decision to undergo transplantation with a marginal liver or not, we propose to utilize machine learning to generate personalized risk predictions of post-transplant survival with that specific marginal liver and waitlist survival without that liver, and then develop a decision aid to be used by patients and surgeons to compare predicted survival between both options.",Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation,10208791,F32DK124962,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Computing', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Survey Methodology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplant Surgeon', 'Transplantation', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'liver transplantation', 'personalized decision', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'post-transplant', 'programs', 'public health research', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'risk prediction', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'transplant registry', 'web site']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,84562
"Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity PROJECT SUMMARY The long-term goal of this project is to determine whether optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) might lead more accurate and objective diagnosis, earlier intervention, and improved outcomes in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). International consensus and National Institute of Health (NIH) funded clinical trials over the last 30 years have defined the phenotypic classifications, natural history, prognosis, and management of ROP. However, it is well established that due to the subjectivity of the ophthalmoscopic examination, and systematic bias between examiners, there is significant variation in treatment of the most severe forms of ROP in the real world. This leads to both under-treatment (and poor outcomes due to retinal detachment) and over-treatment (exposing neonates to the ocular and systemic risks of treatment). Roughly 20,000 babies per year develop retinal detachments (RD) due to ROP and there is strong evidence that most of these are preventable. In adult retinal vascular diseases, most notably diabetic retinopathy (DR), OCT and OCTA can detect and quantify disease features such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and retinal neovascularization (NV) before they are noted clinically, enabling earlier treatment and reducing the risk of blindness from RD. However, evaluating the use of this technology in neonates requires high speed and portable technology, and the commercially available handheld OCTs are too slow for ultra-widefield (UWF) OCT and OCTA imaging. Several groups (including our own) have published preliminary results using prototype 100 to 200 kHz swept- source (SS) OCT systems, however consistent data acquisition remains challenging due to the lack of fixation and subsequent motion in an awake neonate, which has limited the evaluation of the potential benefits of the technology in this population. Recently, there has been much interest in using artificial intelligence (AI) (specifically deep learning), which relies on high speed graphics processing units (GPUs) to provide real time OCT image processing, segmentation, and tracking. This application addresses 2 fundamental gaps in knowledge: (1) Can we overcome the technical challenges through the development of a faster ultrawide-field view SS-OCT system coupled with a GPU-enabled DL software system to enable consistent data acquisition in neonates? (2) Would quantitative objective metrics of ROP improve objectivity of ROP diagnosis and detect subclinical signs of disease progression which may enable earlier intervention and improved outcomes in the future. By leveraging our institution’s OCT, AI, and ROP expertise, we will address these questions in three specific aims: (1) Develop an ultra-high speed, handheld, panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA system. (2) Develop real time GPU accelerated intelligent image acquisition software. (3) Evaluate the clinical significance OCT derived biomarkers. Successful translation of this technology to the ROP population could improve the accuracy and objectivity of ROP diagnosis, and lead to earlier intervention and improved outcomes in patients with severe ROP. PROJECT NARRATIVE Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) have proven the ability to detect subclinical disease, provide quantitative evaluation of disease progression, and improve outcomes in the leading causes of blindness in adults, age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Technological and practical limitations have limited the application of this technology in routine use for non-sedated children undergoing routine screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), the leading cause of blindness in children. The proposed project will develop an ultra-high speed, handheld OCT system with graphics processing unit (GPU) enabled real-time processing to improve the feasibility of panoramic ultra-widefield OCT/OCTA imaging in non-sedated neonates and evaluate the clinical utility of OCT-derived biomarkers in ROP.",Artificial intelligence assisted panoramic Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Retinopathy of Prematurity,10198930,R01HD107494,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Age related macular degeneration', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Coupled', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyes', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Natural History', 'Neonatal', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Retina', 'Retinal Detachment', 'Retinal Neovascularization', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Visualization', 'accurate diagnosis', 'arm', 'awake', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diabetic', 'disease classification', 'disorder of macula of retina', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'instrument', 'interest', 'lens', 'macular edema', 'neonate', 'neovascularization', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'overtreatment', 'parallel computer', 'portability', 'prototype', 'real-time images', 'research clinical testing', 'routine screening', 'sample fixation', 'software systems', 'standard of care', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,377300
"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice. A computational pathology approach to characterizing disease will help identify patients for whom aggressive multimodality therapy will improve outcomes and post-treatment quality of life.",A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort,10149283,R01DE028741,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Head and Neck Surgery', 'Head and neck structure', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Medical Economics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral Stage', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Productivity', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Specimen', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Workload', 'analysis pipeline', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer type', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'digital pathology', 'expectation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'international center', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pathology imaging', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'quality assurance', 'quantitative imaging', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIDCR,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,R01,2021,380042
"Characterizing and targeting subphenotypes of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder via individually imputed tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are highly heritable, severe and complex brain disorders characterized by substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity. Despite this, case-control studies often ignore such heterogeneity through their focus on the average patient, which may be the core reason for a lack of robust biomarkers indicative of an individual’s treatment response and outcome. Although they are classified as independent diagnostic entities, SCZ and BD are highly genetically correlated, exhibit high relative risks among relatives of both BD & SCZ patients, and have partially overlapping symptomatology and treatment. In this project we will use tissue and cell-type specific imputed transcriptomes for individuals with SCZ or BD in our VA discovery cohort comprising the Million Veteran Program (MVP) and Cooperative Studies Program 572 (CSP #572, “The Genetics of Functional Disability in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Illness”), as an intermediate molecular phenotype, to identify, characterize and target subphenotypes of these disorders. Findings from the VA discovery cohort will be validated in the PsycheMERGE and BioMe cohorts.  First, we will impute tissue and cell-type specific transcriptomes for all individuals with schizophrenia (SCZ) or bipolar disorder (BD) in the VA discovery cohort. To achieve this, we will train tissue (brain and peripheral tissues) and cell-type (glutamatergic & GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia from DLPFC) specific EpiXcan transcriptomic imputation models at the gene and isoform level. Secondly, we will use the imputed transcriptomes as an intermediate molecular phenotype to identify genetically-regulated gene expression (GReX) based subpopulations and within them the key molecular drivers using deep neural networks (DNNs). Lastly, we will identify key non-genetic biomarkers and effective treatments for each validated subphenotype. Non-genetic biomarkers will be based on pre-mined features available from the electronic health records (EHR) and features extracted from the EHR via natural language processing (NLP). The subphenotypes will be validated in the civilian cohorts PsycheMERGE and BioMe.  This project will take place at the Icahn School of Medicine, one of the leading centers of data science, genomics and precision medicine. The mentoring committee comprises experts in the fields of computational and functional genomics, integrative analysis, machine learning (including DNNs and NLP), and EHR mining. Dr. Voloudakis will develop the skills necessary to launch an independent academic career in genetically based EHR-informed precision psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) are genetically correlated, highly heritable, severe and complex brain disorders characterized by substantial clinical and biological heterogeneity with partially overlap- ping symptomatology and treatment. This project will use tissue and cell-type specific imputed transcriptomes for individuals with SCZ or BD to identify, characterize and target subphenotypes of those disorders.

"Personalized Management of Intracranial Aneurysms Using Computer-aided Analytics Abstract The primary objective is to develop an artificial intelligence-centric, quantitative and noninvasive software platform that can be integrated into 3D angiographic scanners (DSA, CTA or MRA) to provide guidance regarding the diagnosis and management of intracranial aneurysms (IA). Hemorrhagic stroke secondary to ruptured IAs leads to significant morbidity and mortality and affects over 35,000 patients on a yearly basis in the United States. The diagnosis of asymptomatic IAs is on the rise with the increasing use of cerebral imaging. However, guidance regarding which aneurysms should be treated has not advanced. Leveraging recent advances in computational science and technology, particularly artificial intelligence, the proposed software platform built on two enabling technologies can (1) propel automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations into the clinical workflow and (2) conduct “data-driven” risk assessments of IA rupture on an individual basis. Specific research aims are to (1) develop a clinically-oriented CFD platform that enables automated “patient-specific” hemodynamic evaluations of IAs, (2) investigate data-driven analytics toward prediction of rupture risk for IAs and (3) evaluate the data-driven analytics in a blind study. Once validated, a follow-up R01 project is planned to examine the clinical utility of the proposed software platform in a prospective clinical study as a single gateway for computer-aided evaluation of cerebral aneurysms. Public Health Relevance/Narrative This R01 proposal is to investigate the feasibility of developing an innovative, non-invasive and artificial intelligence-centric tool that can be used as a software add-on to clinical angiographic (e.g. DSA) scanners. The software can automatically select high-risk aneurysms for immediate treatments from a pool of patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms, impacting the clinical management of intracranial aneurysms.",Personalized Management of Intracranial Aneurysms Using Computer-aided Analytics,10121043,R01EB029570,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Aneurysm', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benign', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cerebral Aneurysm', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Geometry', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Genetic', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intracranial Aneurysm', 'Knowledge', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Natural History', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Aneurysm', 'Secondary to', 'Smoker', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'blind', 'computer grid', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'neurosurgery', 'open source', 'personalized management', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'shear stress', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,MICHIGAN TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,346966
"CT and CXR Phenotyping Platform for Assessing COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity Abstract COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11. Since then, there have been 8.15 million confirmed cases worldwide with a case fatality rate ranging from 16.3% to 0.1%. In the US, there have been 2,187,202 cases with a 5.4% case fatality rate as of June 16, 2020. The magnitude of this infectious disease has stressed the need to develop novel methodologies to define who are at the highest risk of developing acute symptoms. X-Ray (CXR) and Computed Tomography (CT) play a fundamental role in the detection and follow-up of the COVID-19 lung injury. It also provides a unique opportunity to define quantitative biomarkers that may identify susceptible subjects to the acute phase of the disease using pre-infection and early infection radiological exams. This proposal's broad objective is to provide a better understanding of acute COVID-19 susceptibility markers based on artificial intelligence approaches on radiological exams, both CT and CXR. CT offers a unique way to phenotype the lung and its changes. Subtle changes of normal parenchyma have been associated with systemic inflammation that can be detected on CT. We hypothesize that susceptible subjects for acute COVID- 19 disease evolution will express inflamed normal parenchymal signatures that can be measured on CT scan prior to the infection or in the early phases of the viral infection. We will develop new computational approaches to identify radiographic patterns consistent with inflamed normal parenchyma as well as early COVID-19 injury and compute radiomics signature that can capture the heterogeneity of the radiographic expression for each lung pattern. We will define new CT-based biomarkers for acute COVID-19 susceptibility using Gradient Boosting decision trees and feature importance. We will then translate the quantification of the most relevant features in CXR image using image translation approaches based on deep neural networks. Finally, we will integrate these automated tools in the CIP workstation using clinically friendly end-to-end workflows to empower clinical investigations across the world. We will continue the support and dissemination of this tool across the research community. Over the last 15 years, our group has developed the Chest Imaging Platform (CIP), an NIH-funded open-source software tool for the automated phenotyping of chest CT scans that is widely used in the chronic lung disease research community. Since the beginning of the pandemic, CIP has been used to the characterization of COVID-19 using existing densitometric metrics. Our commitment to open science in the form of open toolkits that are freely distributed is fundamental to catalyze the application of AI and imaging in the context of this pandemic. Project Narrative As of June 16, there has been 2.18 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States with 118,435 fatalities. Unlike many other diseases, only general epidemiological factors are available for describing the susceptibility to COVID-19 and its acute phase.

"A Handheld Microchip for GC analysis of breath to screen for COVID-19 Project Summary  The COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented societal suffering and economic disruption. In the United States, more than six million people have contracted COVID-19 and more than one hundred ninety thousand patients have died of this disease to date. Although current COVID-19 diagnostic testing technologies are critical for slowing the spread of the virus and preventing future outbreaks, they are not practical for field use. Current diagnostic tests are cumbersome to perform because they use aqueous solutions, require multiple steps, and hours-to-days to obtain results. Since the US began to reopen the economy in May, there has been a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic approach that is non-invasive, portable, and can rapidly provide test results.  The overall goal of the project is to develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). The handheld tool will be a closed system for trapping select volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on a microfabricated chip. The captured VOCs will be eluted with ethanol and then analyzed using a commercially available, portable GC-PID instrument. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms will be applied to recognize the VOC pattern that correlates with COVID-19 infection. The central innovation is the microfabricated chip that captures carbonyl compounds in exhaled breath and thus serves as a preconcentrator, which enables analysis of carbonyl VOCs by the portable GC-PID. The hypothesis is that the carbonyl metabolome in exhaled breath is directly related to the body’s reaction to the novel coronavirus infection, and changes in the carbonyl VOC composition in exhaled breath relative to healthy controls can be used to detect both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19 patients.  Three specific aims are proposed to fulfill the overall goal. Aim 1 is to build a disposable handheld breath analyzer tool for concentrating carbonyl VOCs. Aim 2 is to identify VOC patterns in the breath of COVID-19 patients by machine learning algorithms. Aim 3 is to integrate portable GC technology with the breath sampling tool for COVID-19 screening guided by an AI system. The University of Louisville is uniquely suited to rapidly transition the microchip technology to field use because of the PI and Co-PI’s experience in breath analysis and translational research, and the project team’s experience in virology, infectious diseases, biostatistics, and artificial intelligence as well as the state-of-the-art facilities that include a MicroNano Technology Center, Biosafety Level 3 Regional Biocontainment Lab, and an NIH-funded REACH program. 8. Project Narrative  This project will develop a mobile breath analysis technology for rapid screening for COVID-19 using a handheld breath collection tool and a portable GC with a photoionization detector (PID). Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will be used to analyze the detected signals of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath by the portable GC for detection of COVID-19 patients.

"Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis Project Abstract (30 lines of text)  1 Systematic review and evidence mapping, both forms of research synthesis, are formal, sequential processes  2 for identifying, assessing, and integrating the primary scientific literature. These approaches, already  3 cornerstones of evidence-based medicine, have recently gained significant popularity in several other  4 disciplines including environmental, agricultural, and public health research and are increasingly utilized for  5 informed decision making by governmental organizations. It has been estimated that more than 25,000  6 systematic reviews are conducted and published annually and selecting studies for inclusion is one of the most  7 resource intensive steps for any systematic review or evidence map. In Phase I of our research plan, we have  8 developed a web-based, collaborative systematic review web application called SWIFT-Active Screener, an  9 innovative document screening tool that allows users to identify the majority of relevant articles after screening 10 only a fraction of the total number of abstracts. Our goal for the current proposal is to conduct additional 11 research and development required to make SWIFT-Active Screener a commercial success, while also 12 building on and leveraging methods and software we have previously built to address other stages in the 13 systematic review pipeline. Therefore, one of the primary aims of our ongoing research and development is to 14 address this need by expanding the Active Screener application into an integrated platform for research 15 synthesis by uniting it with several of our other related software products. The resulting platform, which we call 16 “swift.ai,” is described in detail in “Aim 1 – Software engineering to create a unified platform for research 17 synthesis.” In “Aim 2 – Improved statistical methods for Active Screener 2.0”, we expand on the methodological 18 research completed during Phase I of this SBIR, to further develop and refine our methods. Specifically, we 19 investigate new ways to integrate state-of-the art methods in deep learning and new ways to better utilize the 20 large amounts of screening data collected from our users in order to improve our models. Finally, in “Aim 3 – 21 Living evidence maps powered by Active Screener 2.0,” we explore new approaches for using machine 22 learning to facilitate evidence mapping. Project narrative Systematic review is a formal process used widely in evidence-based medicine and environmental health research to identify, assess, and integrate the primary scientific literature with the goal of answering a specific, targeted question in pursuit of the current scientific consensus. By conducting research and development to build a unified, web-based, collaborative, systematic review software application that integrates the latest developments in deep-learning, machine learning, natural language processing and artificial intelligence, we will make an important contribution toward ongoing efforts to automate systematic review. These efforts will serve to make systematic reviews both more efficient to produce and less expensive to maintain, a result which will greatly accelerate the process by which scientific consensus is obtained in a variety of medical and health-related disciplines having great public significance.",Swift.ai: research and development of an integrated platform for machine-assisted research synthesis,10259172,R44ES029001,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Agriculture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Elements', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environmental Health', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Influentials', 'Internet', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Formulations', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Toxicology', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'active method', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel strategies', 'public health research', 'research and development', 'response', 'screening', 'simulation', 'success', 'systematic review', 'user-friendly', 'web app']",NIEHS,"SCIOME, LLC",R44,2021,820314
"Evaluation of artificial intelligence-controlled CPR to improve vital organ perfusion and survival during prolonged resuscitation Project Summary / Abstract  Almost 400,000 cases of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) occur each year in the United States. In patients requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for prolonged periods, current CPR methods are unable to maintain adequate blood flow and oxygen delivery to the vital organs. Survival is <10% in patients with shockable rhythms and ~0% in those with non-shockable rhythms. Current American Heart Association (AHA) recommendations for CPR follow a “one-size-fits-all” paradigm. Our goal is to improve vital organ perfusion during prolonged CPR by “personalizing” compression/decompression therapy with a dynamic CPR method that changes compression characteristics over the course of CPR after taking into account the temporal changes of chest wall compliance and hemodynamics in order to increase the rate of neurologically intact survival after OHCA.  In this grant proposal, we are investigating the deployment of machine learning algorithms incorporated into a mechanical CPR device to predict and optimize hemodynamics during CPR. We will use state-of-the-art dynamical modeling in conjunction with closed-loop control algorithms to individualize CPR characteristics and optimize temporal blood flow. Our preliminary results suggest that deployment of machine learning prediction algorithms paired with control algorithms in a preclinical Ventricular Fibrillation model can adapt compression and decompression depth in real time, resulting in increased vital organ blood flow as compared to standard CPR techniques Based on these results, we hypothesize that optimization of compression depth, decompression depth, duty cycle, and compression rate of CPR will lead to better outcomes. Our proposed research will: 1) identify the most promising algorithm for the prediction of CPR hemodynamics 2) identify the best control algorithm to pair with this prediction algorithm in terms of optimizing CPR hemodynamics and return of spontaneous circulation 3) use the prediction and control pairing to improve 48h neurologically intact survival in a porcine model of ventricular fibrillation, as compared to standard CPR techniques. Throughout this process, we will identify non-invasive alternative measurements to provide to the algorithms with the ultimate goal of proceeding with device development and human trials. Project Narrative In light of a growing body of evidence which suggests that prolonged duration CPR is a dynamic process, without universally optimal “one-size-fits-all” parameters, advanced methods of CPR individualization may be applied to optimize cardiac and cerebral perfusion for these patients. We propose to study the effects of machine learning and optimal control techniques within the context of CPR, thus creating a closed-loop CPR system that has been trained by pre-clinical data to modify CPR characteristics and optimize blood flow. Our preliminary studies suggest that machine learning and control algorithms can be successfully deployed in a preclinical model to adapt compression and decompression depth, increasing vital organ blood flow as compared to standard CPR techniques. If our hypotheses are verified, a gateway for the first human trials is open.",Evaluation of artificial intelligence-controlled CPR to improve vital organ perfusion and survival during prolonged resuscitation,10186125,R01HL157625,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Animal Experiments', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Biofeedback', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood flow', 'Carbon Dioxide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Cerebrum', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chest wall structure', 'Choices and Control', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'E-learning', 'Early Mobilizations', 'Evaluation', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gaussian model', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resuscitation', 'Shock', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'coronary perfusion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'pre-clinical', 'prediction algorithm', 'pressure', 'prospective', 'time interval']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,547699
"Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY Depression is an impairing and prevalent mood disorder in adolescence, affecting 1 in 6 youth by age 18. So far, the use of conventional statistical approaches has had limited success in delivering tools for accurate individualized prediction of future depression for a specific child. The objective of this project is to build advanced non-linear machine learning algorithms integrating information from multiple sources to deliver accurate, individualized prediction. To accomplish this objective, the research team will use 5,000 variables (biological, cognitive, socio-emotional, environmental) measured on multiple occasions between the prenatal period and age 10 in children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N = 15,636). The goal is to use features from the prenatal period to age 10 to estimate risk of reaching clinical levels of depressive symptoms between the ages of 12 and 18 years old. The research team will pursue two specific aims. The first aim is to build an algorithm for accurate prediction of adolescent depression by using informative features from the prenatal period until age 10 with machine learning methods that capture complex, multi-variate associations. The team will use several techniques, including artificial neural networks that exploit temporal information (recurrent neural networks, Long Short-Term Memory networks) to identify constellations of highly predictive features. Based on early-life stress sensitization theory, the first hypothesis is that features from the prenatal and early postnatal periods (up to age 5) provide greater predictive power than features from ages 6-10. The second aim is to determine if features predicting depression are unique to depression or shared with anxiety disorder and substance use disorder. Machine learning algorithms will predict age 18 clinical diagnoses of depression, anxiety disorder, and substance use disorder. The team will test the second hypothesis that some predictive features will be unique for each disorder and some will be shared across all three disorder types (e.g., childhood trauma). By accomplishing these aims, the research team will devise a clinically useful algorithm to estimate a child’s probability of developing adolescent depression. All software that will be created for this project will be open-source, and made freely available online in public repositories. Algorithms that would allow accurate early identification of children at risk to develop depression during future adolescent years would provide new avenues for preemptive interventions. This would yield enormous public health benefits by prioritizing treatment and shifting developmental trajectories away from eventual disorder for millions of individuals worldwide. To realize the potential of this overall impact on the field and society, predictive models that calculate risk with high sensitivity and specificity in childhood are needed. The proposed project aims to use robust, rigorous machine learning algorithms to take on this challenge. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on depression in adolescence, which is highly prevalent and impairing during this life stage and a major risk factor for suicide. The project is relevant to NIMH’s mission because it aims to identify early behavioral and biological indicators of risk for depression in order to predict the onset of illness and support early preemptive interventions.",Predicting Adolescent Depression Using Machine Learning,10108555,R21MH125346,"['18 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Crude Extracts', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Emotional', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Benefit', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adverse childhood events', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'developmental psychology', 'early life stress', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'learning algorithm', 'long short term memory network', 'longitudinal dataset', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'maltreatment', 'open source', 'pediatric trauma', 'personalized predictions', 'postnatal period', 'precision medicine', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'preemptive intervention', 'prenatal', 'protective factors', 'psychosocial', 'public repository', 'recurrent neural network', 'speech recognition', 'success', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R21,2021,179604
"Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications Low prevalence searches form an important and problematic class of visual search tasks. These are tasks where the search target is rare. Many socially important tasks like airport security or cancer screening are low prevalence tasks. Previous work, much of it from our lab, has shown that low prevalence can have undesirable effects. Most notably, miss (false negative) errors are markedly elevated at low prevalence. This is a clear problem if the purpose of the search is to detect something rare but important like cancer or a terrorist threat. Our previous work has documented this pattern of increased miss errors in a number of expert domains including cytology (cervical cancer screening), airport baggage screening, and breast cancer screening. False alarm (false positive) error rates typically decline at low prevalence, moving in the opposite direction from miss errors. This indicates a shift in the observer’s decision criterion. At low prevalence, observers become more reluctant to call something a target. Several studies – ours and others - have shown that this “conservative” criterion shift is not adequate to explain the entire prevalence effect. Wolfe and VanWert (2010) developed a “Dual- Threshold” model that better captures the important aspects of the prevalence effect data by proposing two effects of low prevalence: (1) the conservative shift in the criterion for deciding if an attended item is a target, and (2) a lowering of the “quitting threshold.” The quitting threshold determines when observers end a search. Quitting too soon also increases the chance that the observer will miss a target. Prevalence effects have been studied in experimental isolation from other aspects of search. However, in tasks like breast cancer screening, other factors interact with prevalence. The four projects in the present proposal each investigate one of these interactions. Project 1 examines the relationship of prevalence to the “vigilance decrements” that are seen as time elapses in a task. In search, observers must maintain an internal, mental representation of the search target (or targets). Project 2 is concerned with the impact of prevalence on these “target templates”. Advances in artificial intelligence (notably deep learning) are producing tools to assist expert searchers. However, once deployed, these AI tools have been less effective than theory predicts. Project 3 tests the hypothesis that part of the problem is another side-effect of low prevalence and the project tests a potential intervention. Finally, clinicians, searching for one type of target (e.g. pneumonia) are supposed to report signs of other possible problems (e.g. lung cancer). Project 4 probes the role of prevalence in the failure to report such “incidental findings”. Again, we test several interventions. This is “use-inspired, basic research” whose results will provide guidance for experts performing socially important low prevalence tasks. Important tasks like breast cancer screening involve visual search for rare (“low prevalence”)  targets but, unfortunately, low prevalence is known to increase the percentage of targets that are  missed even by well-trained experts. In a task like breast cancer screening, prevalence interacts  with other factors like observer vigilance or the effectiveness of an artificial intelligence tool.  This proposal studies four of these interactions with the goal of counteracting the malign effects  of prevalence; thus making it possible for experts to perform their critical search tasks more  effectively.",Prevalence effects in visual research: Theoretical and practical implications,10111519,R01EY017001,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Breast Cancer Detection', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Collaborations', 'Cytology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Effectiveness', 'Failure', 'Flecks', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Incidental Findings', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Low Prevalence', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pneumonia', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevalence Study', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Screening for cancer', 'Security', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'mental representation', 'programs', 'side effect', 'social', 'theories', 'tool', 'vigilance', 'visual search']",NEI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,441020
"Multimodal monitoring and high-dimensional data for episode prediction in bipolar disorder SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder with high recurrence and disability rates, high economic burden, and an estimated suicide risk 20 times higher than the general population. While efficacious treatment is available, BD patients spend a large proportion of their life symptomatic. Predicting the onset of episodes is a valuable strategy to decrease suicide and disability rates and to optimize healthcare costs. The overall objective of this (R21) Exploratory/Developmental study is to obtain pilot data to support the feasibility and potential value of a new approach to predict mood episodes in stable adult patients with BD. This proposal aims to develop new data modeling and inference techniques that will enable more tailored clinical signal detection: examining changes within each individual, over time. To do so, we propose integrating multimodal, high-dimensional telemonitoring data, nonlinear techniques and artificial intelligence classification systems. This approach builds on our preliminary work on: (i) nonlinear techniques for the study of mood regulation in BD; (ii) an award-winning simulation using a machine learning technique (Markov Brains) for episode prediction in BD. AIMS: Aim 1 (feasibility): To obtain and integrate multimodal data to perform time-series analysis and to calculate entropy levels in 90 euthymic BD adults. Exploratory Aim 2 (potential value): To use machine learning techniques (Markov Brains) to distinguish participants at higher risk for a depressive or manic relapse based on their time-series and entropy levels (from Aim 1). HYPOTHESES: H1: We will be able to collect enough data in 80% of our participants and to integrate multimodal data to perform time-series analysis and to calculate entropy levels. H2: Markov Brains will identify participants at higher risk for a mood episode based on high (vs. low) auto-correlated time-series and low (vs. high) entropy levels. SIGNIFICANCE: This R21 application challenges more traditional prediction models by conceptualizing inter- and intra-individual variability as a dynamic property of biological systems. By leveraging densely-sampled objective and subjective data, autonomic, clinical and demographic data, this proposal aims to develop inference techniques that will examine changes within each individual, over time, in order to enhance the estimation performance. Ultimately, if we develop the capacity to predict mood episodes, we should be able to prevent them. NARRATIVE The proposed research is clinically relevant as it could develop new data modeling and inference techniques that will enable more tailored clinical signal detection: examining changes within each individual, over time, in order to predict mood changes indicative of an imminent episode of illness in bipolar disorder. The project supports the goals of strategy 2.2 of NIMH Strategic Research priorities by creating predictive algorithms at the individual level (what is an individual’s digital signature like, and how well does deviation from that signature predict an event?)",Multimodal monitoring and high-dimensional data for episode prediction in bipolar disorder,10217550,R21MH123849,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Entropy', 'Event', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Technology', 'Heart Diseases', 'Individual', 'International', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Manic', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Property', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Visual', 'Work', 'analog', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biological systems', 'clinically relevant', 'data modeling', 'depressive symptoms', 'digital', 'digital health', 'disability', 'efficacious treatment', 'heart rate variability', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'individual variation', 'mHealth', 'mood regulation', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'suicidal risk', 'telemonitoring', 'tool']",NIMH,CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH,R21,2021,136658
"Differential artery-vein analysis in OCT angiography for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy Abstract: This project aims to establish differential artery-vein analysis in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and to validate comprehensive OCTA features for automated classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Early detection, prompt intervention, and reliable assessment of treatment outcomes are essential to prevent irreversible visual loss from DR. It is known that DR can target arteries and veins differently. Therefore, differential artery-vein analysis can provide better performance of DR detection and classification. However, clinical OCTA instruments lack the capability of artery-vein differentiation. During this project, we propose to use quantitative feature analysis of OCT, which is concurrently captured with OCTA, to guide artery- vein differentiation in OCTA. The first aim is to establish automated artery-vein differentiation in OCTA. In coordination with our recently demonstrated blood vessel tracking technique, OCT intensity/geometry features will be used to guide artery-vein differentiation in OCTA automatically. Differential artery-vein analysis of blood vessel tortuosity (BVT), blood vessel caliber (BVC), blood vessel density (BVD), vessel perimeter index (VPI), vessel branching coefficient (VBC), vessel branching angle (VBA), branching width ratio (BWR), fovea avascular zone area (FAZ-A) and FAZ contour irregularity (FAZ-CI) will be implemented. Key success criterion of the aim 1 study is to demonstrate robust artery-vein differentiation in OCTA, and to establish OCTA features for objective detection and classification of DR. The second aim is to validate automated OCTA classification of DR. We propose to employ ensemble machine learning to integrate multiple classifiers to achieve robust OCTA classification of DR. Key success criterion of the aim 2 study is to identify OCTA features and optimal-feature- combination to detect early DR, and to establish the correlations between the OCTA features and clinical biomarkers. The third aim is to verify OCTA prediction and evaluation of DR treatment. Our preliminary OCTA study of diabetic macular edema (DME) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment has shown that BVD can serve as a biomarker predictive of visual improvement. During this project, we plan to test differential artery-vein analysis for DME treatment evaluation. Key success criterion of the aim 3 study is to identify artery-vein features to provide robust prediction and evaluation of DME treatment outcomes. As an alternative approach, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for deep machine leaning based artery-vein and DR classification. Early layers in the FCNN will produce simple features, which will be convolved and filtered into deeper layers to produce complex features for artery-vein and DR classification. Further investigation of the relationship between the new features learned through the machine learning process and clinical biomarkers will allow us to optimize the design for better DR classification. Success of this project will pave the way towards using quantitative OCTA features for early DR detection, objective prediction and assessment of treatment outcomes. Project Narrative This project is to establish quantitative optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) analysis for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). By translating subjective findings into objective assessments, this study will standardize clinical OCTA for eye disease detection and treatment assessment.

"SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics  The current best practice guidelines for treating depression call for close monitoring of patients, and periodically adjusting treatment as needed. This project will advance personalized depression treatment by developing an innovative system, DepWatch, that leverages mobile health technologies and machine learning tools to provide clinicians objective, accurate, and timely assessment of depression symptoms to assist with their clinical decision making process. Specifically, DepWatch collects sensory data passively from smartphones and wristbands, without any user interaction, and uses simple user-friendly interfaces to collect ecological momentary assessments (EMA), medication adherence and safety related data from patients. The collected data will be fed to machine learning models to be developed in the project to provide weekly assessment of patient symptom levels and predict the trajectory of treatment response over time. The assessment and prediction results are then presented using a graphic interface to clinicians to help them make critical treatment decisions. Our project comprises two studies. Phase I collects sensory data and other data (e.g., clinical data, EMA, tolerability and safety data) from 250 adult participants with unstable depression symptomatology. The data thus collected will be used to develop and validate assessment and prediction models, which will be incorporated into DepWatch system. In Phase II, three clinicians will use DepWatch to support their clinical decision making process; a total of 50 participants under treatment by the three participating clinicians will be recruited for the study. A number of innovative machine learning techniques will be developed. These include a set of new learning formulations to construct matrix-based longitudinal predictive models, and determine the temporal contingency and the most influential features, and deep learning based data imputation methods that can handle both problems of sporadic missing data as well as missing data in an entire view. In addition, multi-task feature learning models and feature selection techniques will be expanded and refined for this challenging setting of large-scale heterogeneous data. The project is highly relevant to public and global health because it will provide a significant step forward in providing effective and patient-centric care in treating depression. It will help personalize depression treatment by identifying patients who are failing treatments early and will assist providers to take necessary actions before patients drop out of treatment.",SCH: Personalized Depression Treatment Support by Mobile Sensor Analytics ,10196980,R01MH119678,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Drops', 'Early treatment', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Family', 'Formulation', 'Health Technology', 'Influentials', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Self Administration', 'Sensory', 'Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'data de-identification', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'feature selection', 'global health', 'heterogenous data', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'medication safety', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'symptomatology', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2021,245551
"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN).

"Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics Project Summary/Abstract: This proposal has two major goals: 1) Define signature exhaled breath volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to diagnose SARS-CoV-2 infections, and 2) Develop a portable chemical sensing device that can capture and detect exhaled VOCs and includes machine learning algorithms for automated data processing and results interpretation. This project will bring a portable sensor forward into clinical use with the aim of supplementing COVID-19 diagnostics with a reagentless alternative. Breath testing of exhaled VOC biomarkers is a relatively new concept that has the potential to transform healthcare in the US and globally. Our overarching hypothesis is that a miniature breath analysis device can measure signatures of exhaled breath VOCs in real-time and correlate their profile to viral upper respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV-2, even asymptomatically. In Aim #1, we propose a prospective, observational study to analyze breath samples from COVID-19 positive and negative subjects, solely for the purpose of analysis through gold standard GC- MS to define breath VOC biomarkers of infection. We will recruit subjects at two local sites, the UC Davis Medical Center (Sacramento, CA) and VA Northern California Health Care System (Mather, CA), where MPI Dr. Kenyon and Co-Is Drs. Harper and Schivo have joint clinical appointments. Our group has a proven track record to conduct these types of clinical breath studies. In Aim #2, we will develop a portable breath analysis device using our novel miniature differential mobility spectrometry (DMS) detector, coupled with chip-based gas chromatography. DMS is a subset of ion mobility spectrometry and detects VOCs at ambient temperatures and pressures, making it highly appropriate for portable devices. This device would include our custom chip- based preconcentrator, which is packed with a chemical sorbent for extraction of VOCs from breath, and will compare functionality of a compact commercially available GC column to a micro-GC column chip from Deviant, a subcontractor in this work. Individual components of this device have already been developed, and under direction of MPI Prof. Davis, Chair of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, a team of research engineers would integrate these pieces together into a single unit. Collaborator Prof. Chuah would guide development of a custom software package for the device with machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities for automated data processing and interpretation. The device would be placed in the hands of clinicians, who would provide feedback that engineers would immediately incorporate into the device and return to the clinicians for more testing. Under Aim #3, our team would process the GC-MS and GC-DMS data generated in this work, identifying a novel VOC profile for COVID-19 diagnostics. Aim #4 would initiate towards the end of this study to develop both a regulatory pathway & contract manufacturing plan for large scale production and deployment of the device for clinical approval. These efforts are supported by collaborator Dr. Nam Tran, Director of Clinical Pathology & Clinical Chemistry at the UC Davis Medical Center. Project Narrative: In the United States and worldwide, public health experts agree that nations must increase their capacity to test for COVID-19, yet global supplies for testing materials remain scarce. This project would lead to the development of an entirely new type of COVID-19 test, one that could diagnose infections with only a breath sample. Through this proposal, our team would develop a portable device that could identify people with COVID-19 infections by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in exhaled breath.",Portable GC detector for breath-based COVID diagnostics,10266337,U18TR003795,"['2019-nCoV', 'Aerospace Engineering', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automatic Data Processing', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Breath Tests', 'COVID diagnostic', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 diagnostic', 'COVID-19 test', 'California', 'Catalogs', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Chemistry', 'Clinical Pathology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consultations', 'Contact Tracing', 'Contracts', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Exhalation', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Flushing', 'Funding', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heating', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Materials Testing', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Observational Study', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Rapid diagnostics', 'Reagent', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Spectrometry', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Respiratory Infections', 'Viral', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'clinical care', 'detector', 'deviant', 'differential expression', 'disease transmission', 'graphical user interface', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'ion mobility', 'large scale production', 'machine learning algorithm', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pandemic disease', 'portability', 'pressure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'risk mitigation', 'scale up', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'volatile organic compound']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U18,2021,975463
"Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers” 7. Project Summary We will test Adapt2Quit, an innovative Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational Messaging System. Adapt2Quit uses complex, machine-learning algorithms to adaptively select the best messages for a smoker, based upon multiple attributes, including: 1) the smoker’s profile; 2) the smoker’s explicit feedback over time to the system; and 3) data from thousands of prior smokers’ profiles and their feedback patterns. Adapt2Quit’s type of machine- learning is called a recommender system. Outside healthcare, companies (like Amazon) use recommender systems to continuously learn from user feedback (e.g.: liked product, products purchased) to improve, thus enhancing personal relevance and customer engagement. Engagement is a huge challenge for digital health. In the field of computer-tailored health messaging, Adapt2Quit is the first to use machine-learning to continuously adapt to feedback and select new personalized messages to send to smokers. To evaluate the impact of the recommender system, Adapt2Quit will be compared with a robust, active control, a simple but effective messaging system. In our pilot experiment, Adapt2Quit outperformed the control, especially among socio- economically disadvantaged (SED) smokers. SED smokers are harder to engage in interventions. Thus, Adapt2Quit’s increased engagement will be of particular importance for targeting SED smokers. In addition to the potential impact of the Adapt2Quit messages in inducing and engaging smokers in cessation, our goal is to increase use of the state Quitline. We will recruit 700 SED smokers at two sites. All smokers will complete a baseline interview and receive a paper brochure with information about the state’s Quitline. Smokers will then be randomized to: Adapt2Quit or the standard messaging. As the system is designed to enhance engagement, and through engagement lead to positive actions, Aim 1 will focus on engagement [Hypothesis (H1a) Among Adapt2Quit smokers, those with higher engagement levels (completed more ratings) will have greater scores on the perceived competence scale (PCS)]. Aim 2 compares (Adapt2Quit and control) behavior change processes including perceived competence for smoking cessation and cessation supporting actions (calling a Quitline) [H2a: Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater scores on the PCS than control smokers; H2b: Adapt2Quit smokers will adopt more cessation supporting actions (Quitline, NRT) than control smokers]. Aim 3 will assess effectiveness of the system [H3a: (primary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater smoking cessation rates (6-month point prevalence biochemically verified) than control smokers; H3b: (secondary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have lower time to first quit attempt than control smokers; H3c: (mediation analysis) Measured internal and external processes will mediate the effect of Adapt2Quit on smoking cessation].

"SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Medical professionals have recently put to rest the idea that there is an ideal weight loss diet for everyone. One cause for obesity is overeating, but we do not know what patterns and behaviors contribute to this problematic habit. Defining problematic eating behaviors that lead to energy imbalance is essential for treating obesity. Studies typically focus on a single putative causal mechanism of overeating such as stress or craving, not addressing the multiple features that co-occur with overeating. Hence, the factors that predict overeating episodes remain unknown, as do which of them contribute to an individual's consistency and variability of overeating. Given recent advancements in passive sensing, we now have the potential to detect problematic eating using seamlessly captured physiological features such as number of feeding gestures and swallows, and heart rate variability. Collecting detectable and predictable features that identify overeating will hone in on the patterns that interventionists may optimally target to help populations with obesity understand their eating habits and ultimately improve their ability to self-regulate their eating behaviors. Location-scale models will map the factors that most contribute to habit formation within subjects, providing interventionists with essential targets to guide behavior. The first aim is to collect sensor-based and ecological momentary assessment data (to assess factors not yet detectable through sensing) from adults with obesity and apply machine learning algorithms to identify a subset of features that detect overeating, as validated against ground truth of videotaped eating episodes and 24 hour dietary recall. Participants will wear a passive sensing sensor suite and respond to random and event-triggered prompts regarding each eating episode. Then, machine learning will determine the optimal feature subset that detect overeating episodes using Gradient Boosting Machines. In the second aim, hierarchical clustering techniques will cluster overeating episodes into theoretically meaningful and clinically known problematic behaviors related to overeating. The final aim is to build statistical models that explain the effect of detectable and clinically-known problematic features on new habit formation. These models will lay a foundation for optimization studies to discover evidence-based decision rules that can guide timely interventions to treat obesity by preventing overeating, and maintaining healthy eating behaviors. PROJECT NARRATIVE Obesity affects more than a third of American adults. Weight loss regimens rely on self-monitoring, but many people struggle to exercise this skill due to difficulty of execution and small perceived short-term benefit. Wearable passive sensors allow us to learn an individual's problematic eating behaviors more easily. Analyzing sensor data then enables us to identify the essential factors that describe and even predict overeating, and ultimately provide personalized care that supports maintenance of healthy eating behaviors.",SenseWhy: Overeating in Obesity Through the Lens of Passive Sensing,10063429,K25DK113242,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Appetitive Behavior', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Computers', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Deglutition', 'Detection', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietitian', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Energy Intake', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Access', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Gestures', 'Goals', 'Habits', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthy Eating', 'Heart Rate', 'Hour', 'Hyperphagia', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mastication', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Neck', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Videotape', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'adult obesity', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'computer science', 'craving', 'dietary', 'emotional eating', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'feeding', 'heart rate variability', 'hedonic', 'improved', 'lens', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'obese person', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized care', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'substance abuse treatment', 'theories', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDDK,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K25,2021,165181
"HEAL Diversity Supplement: Great Lakes Nodes Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract We assess the feasibility of mobile technologies to study the psychophysiological underpinnings of affect in Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). In this feasibility pilot study, we will evaluate participants’ adherence to the procedures of a longitudinal study, including: 1. wearing wearable sensors for the duration of the study, 2. completing research activities involving prompted and self-initiated self-reports on momentary experiences of stress and negative affect. We will also examine the validity and reliability of the physiological data captured with two wearable sensors from two different brands and that are placed in different body locations. It is important to assess the reliability of data from two devices simultaneously to examine issues that may hinder a study’s viability, like data noise, signal problems, or data loss, etc. Lastly, we will utilize this data to investigate the role of autonomic function as a valid physiological marker of stress and negative affect in OUD. This has relevant implications in the understanding and development of digital treatments, as stress and negative affect are major contributors of relapse. This pilot work will contribute to the aim 2 of the parent grant by using digital and computational health cores to advance research in mHealth, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. In addition, the work supported under this supplement will serve as a building block to successfully create and submit an F31 grant proposal, a research that will be carried out following the diversity supplement period. This supplement will support the intensive training and invaluable practical experience that will advance the career of the trainee, Veronica Ramirez. This is in alignment with aim 6 of the parent grant to “expand the pipeline for early investigators” and create programs that support “addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship”. Aligned with this, our research can ultimately help current efforts to address the opioid epidemic to ameliorate its detrimental effects on society. Project Narrative This proposal aims to address the complex problem of addiction and the opioid epidemic. This is important due to the cascade of negative impacts on society. Understanding the psychophysiological factors that interact with disrupted neurobiological systems resulting in increased negative affect could clarify drug addiction trajectories and apply this knowledge to the development of digital therapeutics in mHealth.",HEAL Diversity Supplement: Great Lakes Nodes Clinical Trials Network,10354615,UG1DA049467,"['Abstinence', 'Academia', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Faculty', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Individual', 'Individual National Research Service Award', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Noise', 'Overdose', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Psychophysiology', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technical Expertise', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Veronica', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'Writing', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'base', 'career', 'digital', 'digital mental health', 'digital treatment', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'implementation science', 'indexing', 'mHealth', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'negative affect', 'new technology', 'novel', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid use disorder', 'parent grant', 'pre-doctoral', 'professor', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'statistics', 'stress reactivity', 'substance misuse', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UG1,2021,70982
"Studying exceptional treatment non-responders and genetics to predict treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A major challenge in caring for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is determining the optimal therapy. Several effective biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are available for RA, reflecting both advances in therapy, and the heterogeneity of RA; subsets of patients respond while others do not. Prior studies focused on patients with a good response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), the most common bDMARD, with limited success in finding predictors that can be used in clinical care. This proposal seeks to address that gap in knowledge by taking a different direction. The objective of this study is to focus on exceptional bDMARD non-responders, defining and characterizing patients who have been on ≥3 classes of bDMARDs for RA. We will test whether data available in clinical electronic health record data (EHR) or genomic data can identify exceptional non-responders from TNFi responders. In Aim 1, we leverage data from an EHR cohort of ~16K RA patients to determine clinical factors associated with exceptional non-response using traditional epidemiologic approaches. As well, we will apply approaches using machine learning and topic modeling that will enable us to evaluate the predictiveness of a broader range of features. Examples of features include billing codes, prescriptions, and medical concepts extracted from text notes using natural language processing. In Aim 2, we will test whether RA genetic risk factors available in a subset of patients in Aim 1, and those of other inflammatory arthritides, e.g. axial spondyloarthropathy, can predict exceptional non- response to bDMARD therapy. As part of aim 2, we will also incorporate any predictive clinical factors identified in Aim 1 through the traditional or topic modeling approach. The overarching hypothesis is that the exceptional non-responders may be less “RA-like” than patients who respond to TNFi, with fewer RA genetic risk alleles and classic RA features from the narrative notes. This definition provides a new way to sub- phenotype RA, focusing on those that will have a poor response to therapy. This study is significant because a screen will be helpful not only in the clinic but can also identify patients to target for future studies of novel drug targets. This approach is innovative because it considers contemporary data where patients now have more “opportunity” to fail 3 classes of bDMARDs, where in the past there were only a limited number available. These data will be examined both using traditional epidemiologic models and newer approaches such as topic modeling that can integrate a broader range of data types. Finally, this proposal is designed to anticipate a time when patients will come for their visit with genetic data as part of their medical record. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune joint disease worldwide. In line with NIAMS’ mission to conduct research in the treatment of arthritis, this proposal will investigate approaches using recent data and state-of-the-art approaches to improve RA management. In this proposal, we will define the poorly understood subgroup of RA patients where multiple therapies have been ineffective, enabling future studies to expand our understanding of inflammatory arthritis, and to inform discovery of novel treatment targets.",Studying exceptional treatment non-responders and genetics to predict treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis,10301407,R21AR078339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antirheumatic Agents', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biological', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease-Modifying Second-Line Drugs', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Heterogeneity', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk-Taking', 'Spondylarthropathies', 'Subgroup', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic risk factor', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'joint inflammation', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optimal treatments', 'patient screening', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'response', 'risk variant', 'small molecule', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,251507
"A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment  Unhealthy diet is strongly linked to risks of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and certain types of cancer. The Global Burden of Disease Study has found that, among the top 17 risk factors, poor diet is overwhelmingly the No. 1 risk factor for human diseases. Despite the strong connection between diet and health, unhealthy foods with large portion sizes are widely consumed. Currently, 68.5% of U.S. adults are overweight, among the highest in developed countries. The recent decline in U.S. life expectancy sent another alarming signal about the general health of the American people. Understanding how the diet-related risk factors affect people’s health and finding effective ways to empower them in improving lifestyle habits are among the most important tasks in public health. Unfortunately, dietary assessment in real-world settings has been exceedingly complex and inaccurate to implement. Technology is needed that allows researchers to assess dietary intake easily and accurately in real world settings so that effective intervention to manage obesity and related chronic diseases can be developed. We propose a biomedical engineering project to address the dietary assessment problem, taking advantage of advanced mathematical modeling, wearable electronics and artificial intelligence.  Our research team has been improving the ability to assess diet for over a decade. We have designed the eButton, a small wearable device pinned on clothes in front of the chest, capable of collecting image-based dietary data objectively and passively (i.e., without depending on subject’s self-report or volitional operation of the device). We have also developed algorithms to compute food volumes and nutrients from images. Since the eButton was developed, it has been used by many researchers in the U.S. and other countries for objective and passive diet-intake studies in both adults and children.  Despite the past successes, there have been two lingering critical problems associated with the objective and passive dietary assessment using wearable devices: 1) substantial manual efforts are required for researchers to visually examine image data to identify foods and estimate their volumes (portion sizes), and 2) there are privacy concerns about researchers’ viewing of participants’ real-life images. Although solving these problems could enable the eButton and other wearable devices for large-scale diet-intake studies, we were not able to find effective solutions until recently when Artificial intelligence (AI) emerged. Advanced AI systems, especially those based on deep learning, can be trained by large amounts of labeled data to produce results comparable or even superior to those produced by human in numerous fields of applications. AI technology is also a powerful tool for dietary assessment, potentially providing an ideal solution to the two previously mentioned problems. We thus propose to develop a human-mimetic AI system to recognize foods from images, estimate portion sizes, and find energy and nutrient values from a database in a fully automatic process. Using the AI approach, there will be no need for researchers to view participants’ real-life images, and the AI system well-respects individuals’ privacy because it is trained to recognizes human foods only, nothing else.  Currently, the performances of existing AI systems are limited by the extensive variety and high variability of human foods, insufficient training data, and difficulty in finding appropriate nutritional information from food databases. In this application, we propose a new strategy to personalize the AI system for each research participant using an advanced mathematical model of personal food choices. With this personalization step, the dimensionality of our envisioned AI system can be reduced drastically, and our goal of automatic, objective and passive dietary assessment can be reached realistically. We also propose to improve the electronic hardware and develop a biomimetic camera to enlarge the field of view for the eButton. Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation of the personalized AI system in real-world settings using human subjects. This research aims to apply advanced mathematical modeling, wearable electronics and artificial intelligence to evaluate individual’s energy and nutrient intake automatically and objectively.","A Human-Mimetic AI System for Automatic, Passive and Objective Dietary Assessment",10111099,R01DK127310,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomimetics', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Country', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Developed Countries', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary intake', 'Dietetics', 'Dimensions', 'Eating', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Eye', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Food Energy', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Habits', 'Health', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Label', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Science', 'Obesity', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Privacy', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Unhealthy Diet', 'Update', 'Volition', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cancer type', 'computerized data processing', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dietary', 'effective intervention', 'field study', 'good diet', 'human disease', 'human subject', 'improved', 'infancy', 'intelligent algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mimetics', 'neural network', 'obesity management', 'operation', 'overweight adults', 'robotic system', 'success', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,657303
"Using Artificial Intelligence to Optimize Delivery of Weight Loss Treatment Abstract Seventy percent of American adults are overweight or obese, presenting an unprecedented challenge to the nation’s health systems. Effective behavioral programs exist, but these programs are intensive, long-term and require highly-trained clinicians, making them prohibitively expensive and thus limiting disseminability. Approaches to decreasing costs include replacing highly-trained clinicians with paraprofessionals, reducing contact frequency, and/or automating intervention. However, although these alternative interventions result in considerably lower average weight losses, variability of weight loss is high. Specifically, and consistent with a Supportive Accountability Model, a substantial minority of participants in high-intensity interventions receive no benefit, while a subset of those receiving low-intensity interventions achieve clinically significant weight loss. An ideal weight loss treatment system would enhance outcomes and reduce costs by matching each participant to the intervention he/she needs, thus adapting to participants’ needs and conserving resources where they are not needed. Stepped care represents one such system, but has had mixed success and suffers from a number of shortcomings. The innovative artificial intelligence (AI) strategy of reinforcement learning (RL) provides rapidly and repeatedly-varying features of intervention, continuously ""learning"" which features provide optimal responses for which participants. Our team recently completed a pilot of an AI weight loss system in which overweight adults received a brief in-person weight loss intervention and then were randomly assigned to receive 3 months of non-optimized interventions (i.e., 12-minute phone calls) or an optimized combination of phone calls, text exchanges, and automated messages, selected based on each participants’ response to each intervention as determined by weight and behavioral data. As hypothesized, we achieved equivalent weight losses at a fraction of the time cost. The proposed study would recruit 320 overweight adults, provide 1 month of group-based behavioral weight loss treatment and then randomize participants to either continue to receive group-based behavioral weight loss in a remote format for 11 months (BWL-S) or to reinforcement learning-based treatment (BWL-AI). In line with our Supportive Accountability model, BWL-AI would vary modality, intensity and counselor skill based on continuously-monitored participant digital data. The proposed study--the first of its kind--would expand on our pilot in several ways including sample size, duration, and features of intervention selected by the AI system. Aims of this project are to test the hypotheses that weight loss outcomes in BWL-AI will be equivalent to or better than BWL-S, and that the cost per participant and per kg of lost weight will be less in BWL-AI than in BWL-S. Other include characterizing the AI system (in terms of interventions selected), assessing feasibility and acceptability of the refined AI system, evaluating psychological and demographic predictors of AI intervention selection and investigating differences between responders and non-responders in how the AI system allocates resources. Project Narrative The obesity epidemic presents an unprecedented challenge to the nation’s health systems, and existing gold standard behavioral weight loss treatments are highly expensive to implement due to their intensive, long-term nature and the highly trained clinicians required to deliver treatment. Approaches to decreasing costs (e.g., low intensity treatments, coaching by paraprofessionals rather than experts) have been implemented with moderate success, but weight losses are not consistent across different cost-saving approaches, suggesting that individuals may be best served when they are matched to the type of treatment they need, and when the resources matched to individuals are continuously adapted as their needs change. The primary goal of the proposed project is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an artificial intelligence (AI) system that continuously adjusts features of weight loss coaching including modality and coach skill level.",Using Artificial Intelligence to Optimize Delivery of Weight Loss Treatment,10210830,R01DK125641,"['Accelerometer', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Binge Eating', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Calories', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cost Savings', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Data', 'Effectiveness', 'Expert Systems', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Government', 'Health system', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insurance', 'Intake', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Minority', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Pain management', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Sample Size', 'Selection for Treatments', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'base', 'care systems', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'cost effective treatment', 'cost-effectiveness evaluation', 'design', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learning progression', 'medication compliance', 'overweight adults', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'recruit', 'remote delivery', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'treatment responders', 'weight loss intervention', 'weight loss program']",NIDDK,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,634165
"Validating of Machine Learning-Based EEG Treatment Biomarkers in Depression SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overarching aim of Alto Neuroscience is to advance brain-based biomarkers for psychiatric disorders in order to both optimize treatment pathways and drive the development of novel pharmacological and non- pharmacological interventions. Alto does this by developing and applying sophisticated machine learning computational models to electroencephalography (EEG) data collected at scale in real-world clinical treatment contexts. Specifically, in this direct-to-phase II SBIR proposal we will refine, and then independently validate, two EEG-based candidate biomarkers we have identified for stratifying patients with depression in a manner that both factors biological heterogeneity and informs treatment response. One of our biomarkers was derived in a “top-down” (i.e. supervised) manner by trying to directly predict treatment outcome, while the other biomarker presents a complimentary “bottom-up” (i.e. unsupervised) approach that begins by first identifying the most biologically homogeneous subset of patients and then testing the treatment relevance of the subtyping. Together, these findings represent very robust individual patient-level treatment-relevant EEG biomarkers, and in both cases, help define a critically-important objective approach to prospectively identifying and treating treatment- resistant depressed patients. A successful outcome of the proposed work would yield the first FDA-cleared biomarkers for stratifying psychiatric conditions. It would also provide a basis for targeted development of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions based on the EEG biomarkers. Both outcomes hold substantial commercial value and exciting potential for transforming psychiatry.

"Using Natural Language Processing and Crowdsourcing to Monitor and Evaluate Public Information and Communication Disparities about Colon Cancer Screening PROJECT SUMMARY Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and death rates are higher among Black Americans than non-Hispanic White Americans. While some CRC-related disparities have decreased (e.g., incidence and stage of presentation), disparities persist in the context of CRC screening (CRCS). Studies suggest that supportive and information-rich social networks, both online and offline, could improve CRCS among Black Americans. A growing body of evidence indicates the importance of online sources of health information seeking and scanning about CRC and CRCS, but little is known about the impact of the messages that individuals are encountering on these platforms. Research on the content and volume of messages White and Black Americans encounter from online health information sources is still unclear—particularly regarding any disparities that exist about what specific information is sought, scanned, or shared by Black Americans. There is a critical need to understand which messages resonate among populations at-risk for specific diseases (e.g., CRC) and who may have concerns about engaging in early detection behaviors (e.g., CRCS) and may face disparities in exposure to public information online. The proposed project utilizes and applies novel cancer communication surveillance approaches (e.g., natural language processing and crowdsourcing) to examine public health communication about CRC prevention and control. Aim 1 will use computational, natural language processing approaches to capture and analyze digital and social media information about CRC and CRCS to identify prominent messages, sources and types of misinformation, and information inequalities. This approach offers an efficient, effective, and responsive method to monitor (mis)information and emerging messages about CRCS. Aim 2 will use a crowdsourcing approach (wiki surveys) to assess population perceptions of public information and messages about CRCS. Recruiting nationally representative samples of White (N = 1,000) and Black American (N = 1,000) adults ages 45-74, we will use an innovative data collection procedure known as wiki surveys to rank candidate messages as potential message targets in strategic efforts to promote CRCS. For Aim 3, we will conduct a randomized controlled message trial (N = 1,600) to determine the validity of the wiki survey approach to selecting messages for targeted audience segments. We will use data collected from Study 2 to identify four sets of messages with strong arguments respective to each target audience’s rankings: highest rated messages for both audiences, highest rated messages for target in-group, highest rated messages for target out-group, and middle-/median-rated messages. We will cross those message categories with target audience (White/Black American) to test if messages selected via the wiki survey are associated with intentions to adhere to screening recommendations in the future and share CRCS messages. The project will offer evidence to help determine the validity and scalability of these novel methods, which is essential to innovate formative research and evaluation approaches in the future. PROJECT NARRATIVE Efforts to improve public health communication about colorectal cancer (CRC) and CRC screening (CRCS) require understanding what information is commonly seen by target audiences and consideration of existing information and behavior disparities for populations at higher risk for CRC (e.g., Black Americans). The current project uses novel computational approaches to monitor the public communication environment about CRCS, crowdsourcing to engage in formative evaluation of possible message content, and a randomized, controlled trial to validate these computational and crowdsourcing approaches. The project tests novel approaches to monitor and evaluate public health information to inform health communication research and practice.",Using Natural Language Processing and Crowdsourcing to Monitor and Evaluate Public Information and Communication Disparities about Colon Cancer Screening,10187999,R37CA259156,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohols', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Cancer Control', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communication', 'Communication Research', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Death Rate', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Health Policy', 'Health Promotion', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Information and Media', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Misinformation', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Perception', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Public Opinion', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Social Network', 'Source', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'United States', 'Woman', 'caucasian American', 'colon cancer screening', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'crowdsourcing', 'design', 'digital media', 'efficacy trial', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'formative assessment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'recruit', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'social media', 'wiki']",NCI,IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,396908
"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,10164748,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans Health Administration', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data repository', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid user', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'substance use treatment', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2021,203040
"Develop an Artificial Intelligence-powered Smartphone App AICaries for Caries Detection in Children Project Summary Early childhood caries (ECC) is the most common chronic childhood disease, with nearly 1.8 billion new cases per year globally. ECC afflicts approximately 55% of low-income and minority US preschool children, resulting in harmful short- and long-term effects on health and quality of life. The current biomedical approach to control the ECC pandemic has had limited success. It primarily focuses on restorative procedures rather than population-wide preventive strategies. Clinical evidence shows that caries is reversible if detected and addressed in its early stages. However, many low-income US children often have poor access to pediatric dental services. In this underserved group, dental caries is often diagnosed at a late stage when extensive restorative treatment is needed. We believe that with more than 85% of lower-income Americans owning a smartphone, mHealth tools hold great promise to achieve patient-driven early detection and risk control of ECC. Our long-term goal is to develop strategies that use mHealth tools to achieve early detection and prevention of ECC at a broad population base. Our previous innovative work has led to a novel prototype of an artificial intelligence (AI) -powered smartphone app, AICaries, to be used by children's parents/caregivers. This AICaries app prototype offers a) AI-powered caries detection using photos of children's teeth taken by the parents' smartphones, b) interactive caries risk assessment, and c) personalized education on reducing children's ECC risk. The preliminary AI- powered caries detection module demonstrated a satisfactory sensitivity and specificity for front teeth caries detection, using 6,895 annotated tooth images from 1,277 photos. We have recently built an archive of > 100,000 high-quality intra-oral photos that is ready to be used for finalizing the development of a reliable automatic detection algorithm. The immediate objectives of the study are - AIM 1: complete the development of AICaries smartphone app, maximize its caries detection performance, and achieve a caries detection sensitivity and specificity that are comparable to trained dental practitioners; AIM 2: employ a community-based participatory research strategy to conduct moderated testing and refinement of the app usability, and non-moderated field testing of the app feasibility/acceptability. Our multidisciplinary team is well-positioned for proposal success with needed expertise in computer science, AI imaging recognition, oral health care, mHealth, disparity research, patient education and community engagement. The AICaries app could facilitate early detection of ECC for many underserved US children, who often have poor access to pediatric dental services. Using AICaries, parents can use their regular smartphones to take photo of their children’s teeth and detect ECC aided by AICaries, so that they can actively seek treatment for their children at an early and reversible stage of ECC. Using AICaries, parents can also obtain essential knowledge on reducing their children's caries risk. Data from this R21 will support a R01 clinical trial that evaluates the real-world impact of using this innovative smartphone app on early detection and prevention of ECC among low-income children. Narrative Although largely preventable, early childhood caries (ECC) remains the most common chronic childhood disease, disproportionately afflicts vulnerable parts of the population and has a substantial adverse impact on children, families, and healthcare systems. Our multidisciplinary team is proposing to use an Artificial Intelligence-powered mHealth tool coupled with a community engagement strategy to revolutionize the detection and monitoring of ECC at the patient level, which may pave the way for improving oral heath among low-income children.",Develop an Artificial Intelligence-powered Smartphone App AICaries for Caries Detection in Children,10105768,R21DE030251,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Caregivers', 'Caries prevention', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Dental', 'Dental Care', 'Dental Clinics', 'Dental Hygiene', 'Dental caries', 'Dentists', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Low income', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Oral', 'Oral health', 'Parents', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preschool Child', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'community based participatory research', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'detection sensitivity', 'early childhood', 'education resources', 'empowered', 'field study', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'lower income families', 'mHealth', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'performance tests', 'population based', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'restorative treatment', 'satisfaction', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2021,189800
"PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device Project Summary/Abstract  This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase-II project proposes the deployment of an AI-powered image-processing tool, named PostureCheck™, to automatically detect when patients perform undesirable compensatory movements during robot-assisted upper-extremity (UE) rehabilitation exercises. The system is based on a standard video camera and the artificial intelligence (AI) software developed under the NIH Phase-I project. PostureCheck™ will be fully integrated with Barrett Technology's existing Burt® UE rehabilitation robot, ensuring that patients are provided appropriate and timely feedback to encourage the correct performance of therapeutic exercises without requiring constant therapist supervision.  Burt® is an FDA-listed UE rehabilitation robot that supports the weight of a patient's arm and hand while the patient moves his/her arm to interact with on-screen games. Burt® offers guided assistance, visual and haptic feedback, and activities and assessments to both help train the patient and measure progress. Clinical studies have shown that Burt® can be used to improve patients' performance in one-on-one sessions with a therapist. However, the system lacks the capability for a single therapist to monitor and work with several patients and Burt® systems at one time.  The proposed SBIR Phase-II activities are organized in three aims. In Aim 1, the annotated dataset generated in Phase-I will be used to develop three separate AI modules. These modules will be integrated into a framework that allows therapists to monitor the outcome of the modules, and, through feedback, enable the system to auto- adapt to improve performance continuously. In Aim 2, stakeholder feedback will be gathered and integrated to design multiple user interfaces for the PostureCheck™ tool. Specific interfaces will be created for use by therapists during and after RT sessions. PostureCheck™ will be integrated with the Burt® device to empower therapists to provide effective feedback to patients and deter the use of compensatory movements. Finally, in Aim 3, forty-two stroke survivors will be recruited in an interventional study deploying the PostureCheck™ and Burt® systems. Subjects will undergo eighteen RT sessions in either an individual or group therapy format. Motor performance between groups will be compared to gather information about the suitability of the combined systems for multi-patient RT therapy in future rehabilitation centers.  The long-term commercial goal of the project is to provide a practical Burt®-plus-PostureCheck™ system to empower therapists to supervise multiple patients simultaneously through a gamut of useful functionalities. The system will be suitable for deployment in clinics as well as rehabilitation centers such as wellness gyms. Project Narrative  Each year, more than 650,000 Americans survive a type of stroke that particularly weakens one side of the body in most cases. During upper-limb rehabilitation, appropriate feedback from a therapist to discourage stroke survivors from performing undesirable compensatory movements results in better motor recovery and ultimately improved function. This proposal aims to expand PostureCheck™, to provide timely and targeted feedback and enable therapists to perform robot-assisted and multi-patient therapy in a minimally supervised session.",PostureCheck: A vision-based compensatory-posture-detection tool to enhance performance of the BURT® upper-extremity stroke-therapy device,10156853,R44EB027525,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Adult', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Ensure', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Group Therapy', 'Hand', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Names', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Occupational Therapist', 'Outcome', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Posture', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rehabilitation Centers', 'Rehabilitation device', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Side', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survivors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Extremity', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'arm movement', 'base', 'chronic stroke', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost efficient', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'exercise rehabilitation', 'experience', 'functional independence', 'haptic feedback', 'image processing', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'interest', 'motor impairment', 'motor learning', 'motor recovery', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'robot assistance', 'robot rehabilitation', 'robotic system', 'software development', 'stroke patient', 'stroke rehabilitation', 'stroke survivor', 'stroke therapy', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIBIB,"BARRETT TECHNOLOGY, LLC",R44,2021,813419
"DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES ABSTRACT Anti-TNF therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic inflammation of the digestive system which presents both an economic burden as well as prominent disability and morbidity. These therapies, however, are largely ineffective in IBD patients, with primary non- response rates varying from 10-30%, and with 23-46% of patients losing response over time. They also lead to adverse health outcomes including increased risk of infections (most notably reactivation of tuberculosis), liver problems, arthritis, and lymphoma. Due to biologic switching where multiple drugs are tried in sequence until an effect is observed, they often lead to overall increased healthcare costs. There is no clear predictive factor of response or loss of response to anti-TNF therapies, with current research focusing on efficacious dosage and inhibitor selection. While numerous predictors of response have been identified in studies, none are robust enough to impact clinical practice. Overcoming this gap in the administration of anti-TNF therapies will be an important next step in improving their utility and reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality. This project proposes a multicohort meta-analysis and machine learning approach to discover and validate a prognostic gene signature that can differentiate anti-TNF responders from non-responders in IBD patients, allowing for improved decision-making and positive health outcomes. Despite the broad biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity inherent in such a task, the Inflammatix analytical framework was able to identify significant differentially expressed genes that discriminate anti-TNF responders from non-responders (mean discovery AUC of ~0.83 and mean validation AUC of ~0.81). Supported by these preliminary results, this project will (1) discover a robust, clinically translatable multi-gene prognostic signature using publicly available datasets, (2) generate independent gene expression data from retrospective cohorts of mucosal biopsy samples (n=150) to validate the signature (target AUC > ~0.8), and (3) use our proprietary Inflammatix machine learning (IML) platform to train and validate a plethora of machine learning algorithms to develop a robust, generalizable classifier (target AUC ~ 0.8 - 0.9) that is ready for clinical validation via prospective studies. Our novel prognostic signature will transform the clinical paradigm in the use and administration of anti-TNF therapies, maximizing treatment benefit while minimizing patient exposure to potentially harmful side effects and adverse health outcomes, consequently reducing financial burden for the healthcare system and patient. NARRATIVE Anti-TNF therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however, they are ineffective in greater than half of patients, and carry significant risks with associated healthcare costs. This project will discover and validate a prognostic, generalizable mRNA signature that can identify IBD patients who are likely to respond to anti-TNF treatment, transforming how physicians use and administer these expensive and oftentimes risk-laden therapies to maximize patient benefit and minimize adverse health outcomes. Improved treatment decision-making will undoubtedly help address ever-increasing cases of IBD in the US and globally while reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality.",DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES,10138841,R43DK127578,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Colonoscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Robin bird', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'TNF gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'acute infection', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'clinical development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically translatable', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'dosage', 'gastrointestinal system', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multilayer perceptron', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive signature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'service providers', 'side effect', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,"INFLAMMATIX, INC.",R43,2021,251371
"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",10129958,R01EB028591,"['Affect', 'Alkalies', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Uric Acid', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcium phosphate', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'prevent', 'risk minimization', 'statistical learning', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,350335
"A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data SUMMARY: A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict AAA Prognosis  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the aorta. If left untreated AAA may go on to rupture, an occurrence which has a 90% mortality rate and is the 13th leading cause of death in the United States, with more than 15,000 annual deaths reported annually. After AAA is diagnosed, a clinician must determine its severity; i.e., the relative risk of rupture compared to the risk of intervention. Current clinical guidelines for this determination is based on the one-size-fits-all “maximum diameter criterion”, which states that when a AAA reaches 5.5 cm in diameter, the risk of rupture necessitates repair of the aneurysm. However, smaller sized AAAs (< 5.5 cm) have been seen to rupture at rates of up to 23.4%, demonstrating that this diameter-based criterion is unsuitable for AAA management. A recently completed NIH-funded clinical trial, 1U01-AG037120: “Non-Invasive Treatment of AAA Clinical Trial” (N-TA3CT) was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of pharmacologic treatment of small AAA. During this trial, a highly unique and valuable dataset was collected longitudinally every 6 months for a 3-year period for patients presenting with small AAA.  This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that, at the time of discovery of small AAA, clinical prognosis – i.e., predicting if and when clinical intervention will be required based on rupture risk metrics – can be facilitated using machine learning-based algorithms using real-time biomechanical, morphological, and clinical data. To address this hypothesis, we will pursue two specific aims.  Aim 1 will be to quantify the “evolution” of individual small AAA from the N-TA3CT trial. The biomechanical and morphological status of all patient AAAs at each timepoint will be determined from data collected during the trial using finite element analysis and morphometric analysis, respectively, and these will be tabulated along with clinical indices for each AAA at each timepoint.  Aim 2 will be to develop and validate machine learning and regression techniques to forecast the clinical prognosis of small AAA. The data from Aim 1 as well as follow-up reporting data from the N- TA3CT trial will be used to train machine learning classification models to determine whether aneurysm prognosis can be accurately predicted. Validation will be performed on a subset of data to assess the accuracy, sensitivity, precision and specificity of the proposed prediction model.  The unique dataset from the N-TA3CT trial, paired with the extensive experience of and methods developed by our lab, will allow us, for the first time, to carefully examine and quantify the natural evolution of small AAA and to subsequently develop a predictive model to improve patient prognosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, when clinicians must decide if or when to fix an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA; characterized by the ballooning of a thin and weakened wall), they base their decision solely on the AAA diameter. However, a quarter of AAA below the accepted cutoff diameter still rupture, often leading to death. In this project, we will use a unique database collected during a clinical trial of small AAA, computer models, and machine learning to create a new decision method that will better serve patients with this disease.",A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data,10115365,R21HL156246,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Aneurysm', 'Annual Reports', 'Aorta', 'Biomechanics', 'Caliber', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilatation - action', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'rate of change', 'repaired', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,117375
"Real time colon histopathology by infrared spectroscopic imaging Abstract Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of death in the US. Active screening and early intervention in risky cancers can lead to good outcomes; however, a bottleneck in rapidly delivering appropriate patient care is the long time period for histologic assessment and lack of precision in predicting disease severity. Morphological assessments prevalent in histology are useful but resource intensive and not predictive enough. Molecular techniques to complement traditional pathology are emerging but often require much more effort and time, without being especially compatible with histologic assessments. Here, we seek to develop a technology that measures the chemical content of tissues, does not require reagents, is entirely compatible with clinical workflows and leverages modern artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to provide real-time histologic assessment. The foundation of our approach is a new design for an infrared spectroscopic imaging system that is faster than any reported, offers a higher spatial and spectral quality and uses a solid immersion lens with a fixed focus at the sealed surface of the lens to enable use by a minimally trained person. In conjunction with the instrument, we develop AI algorithms that measure the chemical content of tissue and use it to provide (a) conventional pathology images without the use of dyes (“stainless staining”), and (b) histologic assessment based on molecular data, which can provide complementary composition, disease and risk of lethal cancer images akin to conventional pathology. The instrument will be usable by laboratory technicians, without the need to prepare thin sections from excised tissue and will provide information in minutes. Using preliminary data from human patients on over 850 tissue microarray (TMA) samples from 8 TMAs and 30 surgical resections, we validate the use of technology in providing complete histologic and disease grade assessment. Statistical methods will be used to assess the results rigorously and quantitative milestones guide the entire approach. We then translate the results to fresh tissue chunks, providing histology minutes after tissue is extracted from the body. Finally, we use the detailed tumor and microenvironment information available from the tissue to segment patients into a “high risk” and “low risk” group. The availability of rapid histologic assessment can help prevent delays in providing care, provide intraoperative assessment, and add more information to morphologic assessments following screening, enabling a wide use in CRC and other cancer pathologies. Project Narrative Colorectal cancers (CRC) are among the leading causes of death from cancers in the US. Morphologically assessing excised tissue is the gold standard but requires fixation, staining, microscopy and pathology review, taking days and the information not being especially prognostic. This project develops an alternate technology based on chemical imaging evaluation that can provide an assessment within minutes, resulting in a new instrument, artificial intelligence methods for histology and microenvironment-powered prediction of disease course.",Real time colon histopathology by infrared spectroscopic imaging,10318008,R01CA260830,"['Analysis of Variance', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Cancerous', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Colon', 'Color', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronics', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Fourier Transform', 'Fresh Tissue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Immersion', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Chemicals', 'Laboratory Technicians', 'Lead', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymph Node Involvement', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Microtomy', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Morphology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Polyps', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Reagent', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Solid', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cell type', 'clinical translation', 'colorectal cancer treatment', 'coronavirus disease', 'deep learning', 'design', 'design and construction', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'human data', 'imaging system', 'improved outcome', 'instrument', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'lens', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'real-time images', 'rural setting', 'sample fixation', 'screening', 'seal', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'technology validation', 'tissue archive', 'tool', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R01,2021,466088
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients. This mid-career investigator award in patient-oriented research will develop and test methods to surmount these three barriers in the context of a multifaceted training program that will make the Principal Investigator a more effective mentor and team leader.",Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure,10219347,K24HL143289,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Advance Directives', 'Affect', 'American', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'behavioral clinical trial', 'behavioral economics', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'career', 'clinical infrastructure', 'clinical trial enrollment', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'financial incentive', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'palliative', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'student mentoring', 'treatment effect', 'trial comparing', 'uptake', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K24,2021,118570
"Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract Lyme Disease is a tickborne illness with markedly increasing prevalence in the United States and an urgent need for improved diagnostics in its early stages, when treatment is most efficient. While classic clinical presentation of the early illness is the presence of erythema migrans (EM), or “bullseye rash”, surrounding the tick bite site, 20-30% of patients do not present with EM. Further complicating diagnosis is a proportion of patients who present with EM, but are seronegative on the current standard two-tiered test algorithm (STTTA). The proposed research addresses the need for improved serological tests to diagnose early Lyme Disease in these patients, while the disease is the most responsive to treatment. A proof-of-concept antigen panel capable of distinguishing STTTA-positive acute Lyme samples from endemic controls was identified using a novel antigen discovery approach. This approach relies on representing an entire binding space of a donor’s circulating antibody repertoire using machine learning models based on the antibody binding profile to a diverse, random library of 126,050 peptides with an average length of 9 amino acids, which is a sparse representation of all possible amino acid combinations. Resulting models are then used to identify pathogen epitopes with high predictive power that are combined into a panel with diagnostic efficacy. Here, the unmet need of diagnosing early Lyme disease in STTTA-seronegative patients is addressed by the addition of antigens predicted as specific to this patient population. Diagnostic efficacy of the supplemented proof-of- concept antigen panel, that was identified in a previous proof-of-principle study, will be tested using an expanded cohort of STTTA seronegative donors and endemic controls. Specificity of the panel for Lyme disease will be confirmed using a panel of look-a-like illnesses including autoimmune diseases and tickborne diseases. This work is expected to yield data demonstrating the feasibility of a novel immunoassay for the diagnosis of early stage Lyme Disease patients currently missed by present tests. Additionally, it will serve as a demonstration of the antigen discovery approach as a means to identify diagnostic antigens for difficult pathogens. Project Narrative Improved diagnostics for early Lyme Disease, the most treatable stage of the disease, are urgently needed to identify infected patients, including those not presenting with the classic bullseye rash or who are seronegative on the standard two-tiered test algorithm. Here, we apply a novel antigen discovery approach that allows us to computationally model patients’ serum antibody binding profiles and predict diagnostic antigens for patients with early Lyme Disease. By developing a diagnostic assay which includes antigens specific for patients missed by current diagnostics, patient outcomes can be improved through enabling early intervention with effective treatments.",Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis,10259497,R43AI162473,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Exanthema', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Serology test', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface Antigens', 'Symptoms', 'Synthetic Antigens', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'United States', 'Work', 'antigen diagnostic', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'density', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'erythema migrans', 'falls', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular diagnostics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'synthetic peptide', 'technological innovation', 'tick bite', 'tick-borne']",NIAID,BIOMORPH TECHNOLOGIES LLC,R43,2021,300000
"Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring Abstract Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). Both hypotension and hypertension can impair the function of vital organs (e.g. brain, heart and kidneys), and intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative mortality, which makes it important to detect BP changes as quickly as possible to prompt timely intervention or therapy. However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, an invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection. In the United States, about 80,000 blood stream infections caused by an arterial catheter are reported annually. Due to the inherent risks associated with a-line, it is used only for clinically indicated high risk surgeries or ICU patients. As a result of the a-line risks and discomforts, even though more than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year, only a small portion receive continuous BP monitoring. In addition, although vital sign (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP etc) monitoring is routine in surgical rooms and ICUs, currently most monitoring devices are fixed in individual rooms, which result in gaps in patient monitoring, accidents during patient transport process, and extra work to disconnect and reconnect sensors when leaving and entering a new facility. Seamless “continuum of care” monitoring—for instance from surgical room to ICUs, including transport in between and without reconnecting sensors—is on top of the wish list by clinician. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop portable ECG monitors and “mobile ICUs”; however so far, no continuous and seamless BP monitoring has been achieved. This proposal fully leverages the outcomes from the related R21 (EB022271) project. We will develop novel machine learning and deep learning based data fusion algorithms to use existing vital signs for continuous BP monitoring, then integrate them with our unique wearable patient monitoring system to form a novel perioperative patient monitoring system. We will test the system’s performance against gold standard a- line and Finapres BP technologies. to develop a fully functional technology for noninvasive, continuous, and seamless BP monitoring. We will also develop a public database for future BP technology development. The proposed multimodality algorithms, seamless BP monitoring system and PhysioNet database will provide major steps forward to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring. Project Narrative Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, the invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection, and current noninvasive BP technologies have poor stability.

"Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults and is associated with high levels of comorbidities, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Although effective treatments with minimal side effects are lacking, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) can reduce body weight and suppress feeding behavior. There is little insight, however, into its mechanism and it is unclear whether VNS effects on feeding and body weight result from non-specific side effects, such as nausea. The current application directly addresses these issues by assessing gastrointestinal (GI) myoelectric changes as a potential mechanism for effects of VNS on feeding behavior, while comparing these responses to emetic activation. We plan to accomplish this by using a ferret model, which is a gold-standard for studying emesis, vagus nerve, and GI physiology. We will test the hypothesis that electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve can reduce food intake without triggering indicators of nausea, such as disrupted GI myoelectric responses, retching, and vomiting. We will complete three Aims. Aim 1: Define the individualized GI myoelectric patterns during feeding behavior using machine learning classification. Animals will be implanted with planar electrodes attached to the GI serosal surface from proximal gastric fundus to distal duodenum. We will use machine learning to classify GI myoelectric patterns of meal consumption compared to emetic-related states, including those elicited by intragastric emetine and high amplitude and frequency VNS known to trigger emesis. Aim 2: Test the efficacy of abdominal VNS on reducing meal size without triggering disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, and emesis. Animals will be assessed for effects of abdominal VNS using a variety of stimulus parameters on feeding behavior and multi-site GI myoelectric recordings. Aim 3: Determine the efficacy of cervical VNS in controlling meal size without producing off-target effects (disruptions of GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, changes in heart rate, or blood pressure). We will test the impact of cervical VNS parameters on feeding behavior, GI myoelectric responses, retching, emesis, hear rate variability, and blood pressure. Our approach is innovative because we will use machine learning classification to detect individualized GI myoelectric response patterns in an awake free-moving animal for comparing therapeutic and off-target effects of VNS on feeding, GI activity, emesis, and cardiovascular function. This planned research is significant because VNS therapy can potentially provide a frontline treatment option for patients with high levels of obesity refractory to behavioral or pharmacological therapy, which unlike other surgical interventions for weight loss, such as gastric bypass, is potentially tunable and reversible by changing stimulation parameters, switching the device off, or complete removal. Obesity affects almost 40% percent of US adults, is associated with type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer, and has a health-care cost that could total nearly one trillion US dollars by 2030. The current project is designed to test vagus nerve stimulation to reduce food intake, while limiting adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and disrupted gastrointestinal function. Our proposed research is relevant to the NIH’s plan to support the design and testing of new interventions for achieving and maintaining a healthy weight (Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research).",Therapeutic potential of vagal neurostimulation to reduce food intake,10207620,R01DK121703,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cervical', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Distal', 'Duodenum', 'Eating', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Emetics', 'Emetine', 'Event', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Ferrets', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Gastric Bypass', 'Gastrointestinal Motility', 'Gastrointestinal Physiology', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hearing', 'Heart Rate', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratory Rat', 'Laboratory mice', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Rattus', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rodent Model', 'Satiation', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stimulus', 'Stomach', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Vagus nerve structure', 'Vomiting', 'awake', 'behavioral pharmacology', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'efficacy testing', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'gastric fundus', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal function', 'healthy weight', 'heart rate variability', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'obesity treatment', 'personalized medicine', 'pre-clinical', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'reduced food intake', 'response', 'side effect', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic target', 'vagus nerve stimulation', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,482164
"Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Abstract Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 5% of all strokes, has a high mortality and the cost to society is similar to ischemic stroke since subjects are much younger. Though SAH fatality has decreased ~50% in the last 25 years due to immediate repair of aneurysms, improved medical management and nimodipine, nearly 1/3 of SAH patients develop delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) often with cerebral infarction which is associated with poor outcomes. Though this was thought to be due delayed cerebral vasospasm, recent studies have shown that decreasing or preventing vasospasm does not improve outcomes. This has led to alternative hypotheses that combined effects of microvessel thrombosis and vasospasm combined with cortical spreading ischemia and peripheral and central inflammation may cause DCI. Thus, there is a great unmet need to assess potential treatment targets that contribute to DCI following SAH in humans and that could be used to predict DCI to begin early treatment and to predict outcome to better allocate resources. The premise of the proposal is based upon the findings that we have shown that gene expression in blood can predict SAH patients who develop vasospasm. This led us to Hypothesize that clotting and inflammatory molecules in blood interact with the brain microvasculature and other factors to cause Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) and delayed cerebral infarction following SAH which lead to poor outcomes. We propose that gene profiles in blood will predict DCI and predict outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).  R61 Phase. Specific Aim #1a: Perform RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on whole blood of a training cohort of patients 1, 2 and 3 days after a SAH but prior to DCI compared to matched vascular risk factor controls. Specific Aim #1b. Identify the most significantly regulated genes and pathways in blood at 1, 2 or 3d that distinguish SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days from SAH patients who do not develop DCI. Specific Aim #1c: Use WGCNA to identify key hub genes and upstream genes expressed at 1, 2 or 3d after SAH and which are associated with developing DCI at 4-14d and might be causative. Specific Aim #1d. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning to identify the least number of genes at 1, 2 or 3d from Aim #1b that best predict (1) SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days (2) and predict mRS of 0, 1-3, 4-5, and 6 at 3 months. Specific Aim #1e. Confirm RNAseq with qRT-PCR and assess qRT-PCR accuracy and precision. R33 Phase. Specific Aim #2. In a separate validation cohort of SAH patients perform qRT-PCR on their peripheral blood to measure expression of genes derived in Aim #1 to predict using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on day 1, 2 and/or day 3 which patients will develop DCI at 4-14 days and which patients will have mRS=0 (no deficit), 1-2, 3-5 and mRS=6 (dead) at 3 months.  Contexts of Use. The molecules/pathways that predict DCI and mRS could serve as future treatment or prevention targets of DCI. Predicting who will develop DCI would make it possible to treat DCI earlier. In addition, future clinical trials to prevent DCI following SAH would enroll just those patients predicted to develop DCI after SAH. Predicting mRS outcomes could be used to stratify patients in future DCI trials. Narrative  This proposal will perform RNAseq on blood of a derivation cohort of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients to determine those genes that best predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) between 4 and 14 days and that predict median Rankin Scores (mRS) outcomes at 90 days using cross-correlation. These genes are then measured in an independent validation cohort of SAH patients to predict who develops DCI by 14d, and to predict their mRS at 90 days after SAH. The studies will direct early treatment for DCI, identify treatment targets for DCI, and help stratify patients for future DCI treatment trials.",Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,10105072,R61NS119345,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aneurysm', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Catheters', 'Cerebral Infarction', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrovascular Spasm', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Endothelin Receptor Antagonist', 'Enrollment', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Nimodipine', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Prevention', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Survivors', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Thrombosis', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vasospasm', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'care costs', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'repaired', 'spreading depression', 'stroke patient', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment trial', 'vascular risk factor', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R61,2021,681385
"Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning This is a K23 award application for Dr. Andrew Sweatt, a pulmonary/critical care physician and young investigator at Stanford University who is establishing a niche in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) precision phenotyping. His work centers on using machine learning to reclassify PAH, where hidden patterns are detected in high-throughput molecular data to uncover new phenotypes. The existing PAH clinical classification does not inform therapy decisions, and outcomes are overall poor with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ treatment approach. There is a critical need for molecular phenotyping efforts, to develop classification schemes that sit closer to pathobiology and identify therapeutically-targetable patient subsets. Dr. Sweatt’s K23 builds on an innovative foundational study where he used machine learning to cluster PAH patients based on blood immune profiling, without guidance from clinical features. This agnostic approach uncovered 4 immune phenotypes with distinct cytokine profiles that are independent of clinical subtypes and stratify disease risk. These findings indicate that inflammation is a viable platform for PAH reclassification. Extensive research has implicated inflammation in PAH and multiple immune-targeting therapies are under active investigation, but these studies rest on the assumption that a common pathophenotype exists. The objective of Dr. Sweatt’s K23 is to better understand PAH immune phenotypes in terms of their longitudinal evolution, mechanistic underpinnings, and therapeutic implications. First, he will perform serial cytokine profiling in two observational cohorts (Stanford, USA; Sheffield, UK) to reassess immune phenotypes during the disease course (Aim 1). Based on preliminary data, dynamic phenotype switches may occur in some patients and reflect changes in clinical disease severity. Next, he will integrate blood transcriptomic profiling and apply sophisticated computational tools to provide phenotype-specific mechanistic insights (Aim 2). He postulates that distinct transcriptomic profiles will link phenotypes to specific signaling pathways and immune cell subsets. Findings will be validated using multi-cohort data from public repositories. Finally, he will perform post-hoc cytokine profiling in two recent PAH trial cohorts where immune modulators were tested, to assess if therapy responses differ across phenotypes (Aim 3). His research could help identify patients who will respond to specific therapies, inform clinical trial designs, lead to biomarker discovery, and define novel biology in PAH. The K23 will provide Dr. Sweatt with the critical support needed to transition to an independent research career and be a leader in PAH precision phenotyping. His K23 objectives are to gain experience in PAH clinical phenotyping/cohort building, expand expertise in bioinformatics, cultivate collaboration, and translate findings to new hypotheses for R01 development. He will be guided by a committed team of multidisciplinary mentors (Roham Zamanian [expert in PAH clinical trial design/biomarkers], Marlene Rabinovitch [leader in translational PAH research], and Purvesh Khatri [pioneer in bioinformatics]) and scientific advisors (Mark Nicolls [translational PAH immunology], PJ Utz [immunology], and Manisha Desai [biostatistics]). NARRATIVE This proposed research is aimed at classifying novel subtypes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), by studying inflammation in the blood of patients (complex protein and genetic profiles) and using sophisticated computational methods (machine learning and systems-based network analysis) to find data patterns that would otherwise remain hidden. This research is relevant to public health as the burden of morbidity and mortality is high in PAH, and the current system used to classify patients does not inform treatment decisions. Our project has significant potential to improve public health, as it may yield a PAH classification scheme that sits closer to underlying pathobiology, provide a critical step toward identifying patients who will respond to specific therapies, help improve the design of forthcoming clinical trials, and create a framework for precision medicine.",Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning,10192823,K23HL151892,"['Address', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Growth Factor', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunomodulators', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mononuclear', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Public Health', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'chemokine', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'data repository', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'protein complex', 'public repository', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'trend']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,193536
"Tracking the microbiome: purpose-built machine learning tools for tracking microbial strains over time Summary/Abstract Approximately 150 million people annually experience urinary tract infections (UTI), the most common cause of which is uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). The gut is a known reservoir of UPEC, which typically reside at low abundance, but can transcend the periurethral area to invade the bladder. While the E. coli population within the gut can be diverse, it has been suggested that certain strains have a greater propensity to migrate and cause infection. This may be one driving factor to explain why half of those with an acute infection have a recurrence even after taking antibiotics that clear the first infection from the urinary tract. Being able to detect and track E. coli strains over time would have direct clinical applications for those patients who have frequent recurrences due to gut UPEC carriage. One such clinical application would be early detection and intervention before the onset of infection. Unfortunately, current metagenomic algorithms are not capable of performing strain tracking accurately enough for clinical relevance, especially for low abundance species such as E. coli. A major factor for this lack of accuracy is that all current state-of-the-art metagenomic tools completely ignore temporal dependence between samples. Even if it is known that multiple samples are from the same patient, current tools analyze those samples as if they were independent. Furthermore, many metagenomic tools ignore the sequence quality information that is provided for every nucleobase in every read. We propose to develop a more precise strain tracking algorithm that does take this additional information into account, making the tool host-time-quality aware. Finally, we will pilot and validate our algorithm on a clinically relevant gnotobiotic colonization model. Specifically, humanized germ-free mice will be undergoing two rounds of E. coli challenges with therapeutic perturbations from antibiotics or mannosides, a small molecule precision antibiotic-sparing therapeutic. We propose the following specific aims: (1) Develop the first purpose-built computational method for tracking bacterial strains in the microbiome over time, (2) Gnotobiotic mouse model undergoing UPEC challenges and a therapeutic perturbation. These aims would advance the microbiome field forward allowing for the future development of therapeutics and clinical diagnostics. Narrative Pathogens often reside in the gut at low abundance, hindering our ability to detect them and obfuscating their pathogenesis. To overcome this challenge, we propose to develop high-quality and high-resolution tools for tracking bacterial strains over time. These tools will further our scientific understanding surrounding bacterial infections and ultimately aid in the development of new therapeutics.",Tracking the microbiome: purpose-built machine learning tools for tracking microbial strains over time,10218776,R21AI154075,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Bladder', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dropout', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enterobacteriaceae', 'Escherichia coli', 'Future', 'Germ-Free', 'Gnotobiotic', 'Goals', 'Infection', 'Invaded', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mannosides', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Shotgun Sequencing', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcend', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Uropathogenic E. coli', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'acute infection', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically relevant', 'de novo mutation', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'human microbiota', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'machine learning method', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiome therapeutics', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'nucleobase', 'pathogen', 'recurrent infection', 'small molecule', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic development', 'time use', 'tool']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,268500
"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,10149998,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Movements', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Visualization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'former smoker', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'respiratory morbidity', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2021,185497
"Clinical Epidemiology of Pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Although the novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has accounted for significant health and economic costs throughout the world, relatively little is known about its effect on children. The first pediatric case of SARS- CoV-2 in the United States was reported on March 2, 2020, and within just three months, over 64,000 cases were confirmed. Even though children, as a group, have been relatively spared from the effects of the virus, there has been an increasing body of evidence to suggest that some may become critically ill. Since a number of children with SARS-CoV-2 infections manifest with severe systemic inflammation and multi-organ dysfunction, more research on determinants of disease and long-term outcomes of those affected is critical. Dr. Oliveira is a pediatric infectious disease clinician whose long-term goal is to become an independently funded physician-scientist, who integrates the disciplines of clinical epidemiology, data science, and biomedical informatics to detect and respond to emerging infectious diseases. The work described in this proposal builds on the scientific themes he developed throughout his prior training and aims to mechanistically understand the effects of SARS-CoV-2 in children by integrating three different scientific tools: natural language processing, machine learning, and clinical epidemiology. The first consideration for this K23 award period will be to use novel computational tools to build automated surveillance and data-extraction system that can facilitate the identification and tracking of incident cases of SARS-CoV-2 in children (Aim 1). Using this surveillance system, Dr. Oliveira will create a comprehensive registry and conduct a rigorous, model-based investigation to derive a state-of-the-art prediction model of clinical deterioration in children with SARS-CoV-2 (Aim 2). Last, he will recruit a longitudinal cohort of SARS-Cov-2 and determine the frequency of complications and long-term outcomes after recovery (Aim 3). This mentored research experience will furnish Dr. Oliveira with skills and expertise in various aspects of clinical epidemiology, including the establishment of surveillance systems, conducting longitudinal studies, computer programing, and executing sophisticated analyses of the longitudinal data. Workshops, semester- long courses will complement this practical experience, and one-on-one mentorship by a multidisciplinary team of established, independently funded, internationally respected investigators and pioneers in the fields of epidemiology, infectious diseases, biomedical informatics, and mathematical modeling. After this work, Dr. Oliveira will have produced important science that could improve the care of all the children affected by this pandemic. Furthermore, he will have gained a unique set of skills and built the necessary infrastructure that will allow him to establish a research program integrating the disciplines of clinical epidemiology, data science, and informatics to detect, prevent, and respond to future pandemics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fear of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is widespread, and the emotional toll of this virus on our society is enormous. However, relatively little is known about the effects of this virus on children. Empiric estimates on the risks and long-term effects of this virus in children will enable clinicians and policymakers to make informed decisions about both the need for optimal use of preventative and therapeutic interventions as they become available.",Clinical Epidemiology of Pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C,10191775,K23AI159518,"['18 year old', '2019-nCoV', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'COVID-19 surveillance', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Country', 'Critical Illness', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Fright', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Hospitalized Child', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric epidemiology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality-of-Life Assessment', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'State Hospitals', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'United States', 'Ventilator', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'body system', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer program', 'computerized tools', 'data access', 'design', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health related quality of life', 'improved', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel coronavirus', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'severe COVID-19', 'skills', 'structured data', 'surveillance data', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tool', 'unstructured data']",NIAID,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,188457
"Climate Penalty: Climate-driven Increases in Ozone and PM2.5 Levels and Mortality Project Summary Climate change is the greatest public health challenge of the 21st century. While numerous pathways of the health impact of climate change have been proposed, the “climate penalty” effect, i.e., a warming temperature worsens ambient air quality and consequently influences human health, remains poorly understood, resulting in an underestimated public health burden associated with global warming. Our previous epidemiological studies have reported that higher summer mean temperatures and higher PM2.5 concentrations are each associated with increased all-cause mortality in the Medicare population (aged ≥65) in the Southeastern US (SEUS)1, 2. Satellite and ground-based observations suggest a strong dependence of air pollution on interannual variabilities of summer mean temperature in SEUS3. These findings suggest that the indirect health effect of temperature via the climate penalty on air quality can be potentially important in the SEUS region, in addition to the direct adverse effects that we observed. However, clear epidemiological evidence of the air pollution serving as a mediator for the health effects of temperature, and accurate estimate of this effect is still missing in current literature. Herein, drawing on our preliminary results, we hypothesize that rising temperature can indirectly affect all-cause mortality via worsening both PM2.5 and ozone levels in the SEUS. We propose a study that will leverage the Medicare cohort from 2000-2016 (124 million person-years), the largest longitudinal cohort available for the SEUS and the high-resolution temperature, PM2.5, and O3 data, to investigate all-cause mortality in response to the “climate penalty” effect using a mediation statistical analysis. Specifically, in this project we will (1) update the present- day temperature and ozone predictions at 1-km2 grids across the SEUS through 2016 by incorporating ensemble averaging of machine learning models; (2) quantify the health effect of “climate penalty” on all-cause mortality using a mediation analysis, and explore whether mitigating anthropogenic air pollution emissions might serve as a pathway of climate change adaptation; (3) perform a risk assessment on the excess deaths related to the climate penalty on air pollution for the mid- (2050) and late-21st century (2100), using climate model output, chemical transport modeling, along with the top-down estimate of “climate penalty” from Aim 2. The proposed research will improve understanding of the interplays between climate, air pollution, and human health based on real-world big data, and provide epidemiological evidence of an important pathway that climate change adversely affects human health, with immediate relevance to climate and environmental policymaking. Project Narrative This project aims to estimate the health effect of “climate penalty”, i.e., the rising temperature indirectly affects human health via worsening ambient air quality (primarily PM2.5 and ozone levels) using a mediation analysis based on satellite-retrieved exposures and Medicare all-cause mortality. We will test the hypotheses that 1) the indirect health effect of a warming climate by worsening air quality can be a major public health burden of future climate change, and 2) improving air quality by reducing anthropogenic emission can mitigate the health effect of climate penalty. We will also forecast the excess deaths in 2050 and 2100 related to the climate penalty on air pollution using climate model ensembles simulated for different emission scenarios.",Climate Penalty: Climate-driven Increases in Ozone and PM2.5 Levels and Mortality,10218738,R21ES032606,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pollution', 'American', 'Big Data', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Climate', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Environmental Policy', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Global Warming', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Ozone', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Planet Earth', 'Policies', 'Policy Making', 'Pollution', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Assessment', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Suggestion', 'Surface', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Weather', 'air pollution control', 'anthropogenesis', 'atmospheric chemistry', 'base', 'climate change', 'climate impact', 'cohort', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'fine particles', 'human old age (65+)', 'improved', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'oxidation', 'pollutant', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'resilience', 'response', 'tropospheric ozone', 'ventilation', 'volatile organic compound', 'warm temperature']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,260895
"Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings Abstract Diarrheal diseases are the among the leading cause of death in children worldwide, most of which occur in low-income countries. In high-income countries, pediatric diarrhea remains a major utilization of healthcare resources. Treatment of diarrhea is mostly empiric, with antibiotic use mostly based on clinical suspicion for bacterial causes. However, the majority of cases of diarrhea do not benefit from antibiotic use, and inappropriate use leads to toxicity and resistance. Furthermore, despite the increasing availability of rapid molecular testing, there is little data to base a decision of whom or when to test. Our overarching goal is to develop and validate clinical decision tools for management of diarrheal illnesses in children of both high and low resource settings. We will utilize prospectively-collected data from two recently-completed multicenter cohort studies of pediatric diarrhea. These studies feature extensive etiologic testing, well-characterized clinical elements, and longitudinal outcome data. We have assembled a team with expertise in pediatric diarrhea, clinical prediction rules, and machine learning methods. In Aim 1, we will use domestic data to develop and validate: a) a score for bacterial etiology, and b) a score for which patients are likely to benefit from further testing. We will derive the scores using data from IMPACT, an NIH-sponsored study of 1200 children from 5 US Emergency Departments, and validate using electronic health records from the Utah Intermountain Health System. In Aim 2, we will use international data to develop and validate: a) a diagnostic score for bacterial etiology, and b) a prognostic score for risk stratification of children who go on to poor outcomes. We will derive the scores using data from GEMS, a study of over 9400 children across 7 low-resource countries, and validate using VIDA study of children in 3 African countries. Completion of the Aims will result in the availability of a number of clinical tools that healthcare workers worldwide can use for evidence-based care of children with diarrhea. Project Narrative Diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. The management of childhood diarrhea often depend on what type of pathogen is responsible, but in many cases testing is not affordable or feasible. We propose studies to develop clinical scores to make it easier for healthcare workers to decide how to manage children with diarrhea.",Development of clinical decision tools for management of diarrhea of children in high and low resource settings,10137881,R01AI135114,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antigens', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Biological Assay', 'Case Management', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Country', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diarrhea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Enteral', 'Etiology', 'Feces', 'Gastroenteritis', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Income', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Minority', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Resistance', 'Resistance development', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Utah', 'Vaccines', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical diagnostics', 'diarrheal disease', 'evidence base', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'low and middle-income countries', 'low income country', 'machine learning method', 'microbial', 'molecular diagnostics', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'tool']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,390449
"The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders Project Abstract At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. However, only about 3% of all children have tics that last for a year or more. Thus chronic tic disorders, including Tourette syndrome, can be conceptualized as a two- step process: tics start, and then they fail to remit. By the numbers, the second part of this process is the more unusual and perhaps more closely related to disease, yet surprisingly, almost no research has examined this critical period after a first tic appears but before it is clear whether the child will go on to have a chronic tic disorder. Therefore prior research that has identified abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS generally does not clarify whether these abnormalities are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. Furthermore, tic disappearance can be observed prospectively, allowing powerful within-subject analyses to test whether features of brain structure or function shortly after tic onset predict remission of tics before TS is diagnosable, and whether such features are state-related or more durable markers of vulnerability to tics. Colleagues in the TS field have agreed that such studies would be valuable, but have suspected that recruitment would be extremely difficult. However, we have now demonstrated enrollment of subjects with New Tics (defined as beginning within the previous 6 months, median 3.6 months) at a rate of 16 subjects per year when recruitment efforts were at their peak—though still on a shoestring budget without full staffing or media advertisements. We have implemented subject preparation and quality control methods that have allowed us to acquire structural and functional MRI data of high quality in many subjects. We now propose to enroll an additional 70 subjects with New Tics and characterize them carefully at baseline and at the 1-year anniversary of tic onset (when TS can first be diagnosed). Both time points will include clinical data, structural and functional MRI, and neuropsychological measures including ability to suppress tics. We expect that complete data will be available for 55-70 subjects (including those already collected), since MRI is sensitive to movement and we are selecting for subjects with tics and additional difficulty holding still (about half of children with tics also have ADHD). We will compare baseline data from this sample to matched tic-free control subjects, and to matched subjects who already have TS or a chronic tic disorder (leveraging existing data in our laboratories to provide some of the clinical and MRI data for these groups). Analyses will include tests of specific a priori hypotheses as well as machine learning analyses of the complete dataset. These comparisons will allow us to discover whether imaging differences in children with TS are present long before TS can be diagnosed, whether they fade when tics improve, and whether they predict outcome in children with new tics. Investigation of this “pre-Tourette” population opens an entirely new window for etiologic discovery in tic disorders. It may also have important clinical consequences, if the results identify which newly- ticcing children are at highest risk for development of a chronic tic disorder. Public Health Relevance Statement At least 20% of all children have tics at some time in their life, making tic disorders a subject of substantial public health interest. In many children the tics will disappear before they've lasted as long as a year, but in others they go on to become Tourette syndrome or Chronic Tic Disorder (TS/CTD). Prior research generally has not clarified whether abnormalities of brain structure and function in children with TS/CTD are related to tic appearance or to the more important process of tic disappearance. This project will study children with recent-onset tics using clinical evaluation, MRI, and neuropsychological measures, and repeat these measures at the earliest time point that TS/CTD can be diagnosed. The results from the first assessment will be compared to results from two matching comparison groups: children with no personal or family history of tics, and children who have had tics for more than a year (Existing TS/CTD). This new approach may provide a new angle on research into Tourette syndrome, in addition to providing sorely needed information about prognosis for children who just started ticcing.",The New Tics Study: A Novel Approach to Pathophysiology and Cause of Tic Disorders,10198671,R01MH104030,"['Advertisements', 'Age', 'Anniversary', 'Appearance', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Budgets', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Family history of', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neuropsychology', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Tic disorder', 'Time', 'brain abnormalities', 'caudate nucleus', 'comparison group', 'critical period', 'dexterity', 'follow-up', 'habit learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical attention', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'phenomenological models', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'secondary analysis', 'support vector machine', 'tic suppression', 'vector']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,626493
"Data-Driven Phenotyping of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Project Summary This predoctoral fellowship will provide the applicant (Hayley Falk), a doctoral candidate in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics at the University of Michigan, with the skills necessary to become an independent research investigator with expertise in novel applications of machine learning for TBI. The limited accuracy of current models for early prediction of GCS 3-8 TBI (commonly referred to as severe TBI) outcomes (prognostic models) is a major barrier to improving the clinical care of patients with GCS 3-8 TBI. Less than 20% of patients with GCS 3-8 TBI experience a good neurologic recovery and currently there are no therapeutic agents that improve long-term outcomes. In GCS 3-8 TBI clinical trials of promising therapeutic agents, a favorable outcome is typically defined as a better outcome than would be expected, taking into account the predicted prognosis for each individual patient. Therefore, accurate estimation of predicted prognosis is critical to assessing the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents. The leading prognostic models for GCS 3-8 TBI, IMPACT (International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trials in TBI) and CRASH (Corticosteroid Randomization After Significant Head Injury), have undergone extensive external validation, however, the discriminative accuracy is highly cohort dependent with AUCs as low as 0.60 in some patient groups. The two major limitations of the IMPACT and CRASH models include one-time measurements of clinical predictor variables and regression-based methods, which are not designed to handle complex, multidimensional datasets. Our objective is to derive a dynamic prognostic model which provides updated outcome predictions as new data becomes available. We will then develop a clustering algorithm to identify physiologically distinct subtypes (clusters) of GCS 3-8 TBI derived from continuous, high frequency data streams. Our proposed goals will be achieved by the following specific aims: 1) we will derive a dynamic prognostic model using a RNN (recurrent neural network)-based framework and data collected during the first two weeks post-injury from BOOST-2 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Phase 2) which provides updated 6-month outcome predictions every 24 hours; and 2) using time series hierarchical clustering and continuous measures of physiologic parameters collected from subjects enrolled in BOOST-2 during the first two weeks post-injury, we will identify distinct subtypes of GCS 3-8 TBI and examine the association between subtype and 6-month outcome. In Aim 1, we hypothesize that our dynamic prognostic model derived from time-varying data will have a higher discriminative accuracy (AUC) than a static prognostic model (similar to IMPACT and CRASH) derived using single timepoint data collected on the day of injury. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that subtypes of GCS 3-8 TBI characterized by continuous physiologic parameters such as increasing ICP (intracranial pressure), decreasing CPP (cerebral perfusion pressure), and decreasing PbtO2 (brain tissue oxygenation) will be associated with poor 6-month outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed project aims to address the limitations of current prognostic models for GCS 3-8 TBI using state- of-the-art machine learning techniques including RNNs (recurrent neural networks) and time series hierarchical clustering. Using time-varying data collected during the first two weeks post-injury from GCS 3-8 TBI subjects enrolled in BOOST-2 (Brain Oxygen Optimization in Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Phase 2), we will use a RNN-based framework to derive a dynamic prognostic model which improves upon the accuracy of existing static TBI prognostic models and a time series hierarchical clustering algorithm to identify distinct subtypes (clusters) of GCS 3-8 TBI derived from continuous physiologic parameters and examine the association between subtype and 6-month outcome. We will validate and refine the models developed using BOOST-2 data and data from a cohort of subjects enrolled in BOOST-3.",Data-Driven Phenotyping of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury,10230403,F31NS118944,"['Address', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cerebral perfusion pressure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coma', 'Complex', 'Craniocerebral Trauma', 'Data', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'International', 'Intracranial Hypertension', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical trial analysis', 'cohort', 'data streams', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'long short term memory', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'neurological recovery', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'pre-doctoral', 'predictive modeling', 'recurrent neural network', 'skills', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'tissue oxygenation']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F31,2021,37988
"Application of advanced methodology to osteoarthritis phenotyping Osteoarthritis (OA) is highly prevalent, contributes to substantial morbidity in the population, and lacks effective interventions to prevent onset and progression. Importantly, and like many other chronic conditions, OA is not a single disease but rather a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. It is becoming increasingly clear that consideration of specific OA phenotypes in clinical studies and trials is critically needed to move the field forward. The overall goal of this line of work is to identify and understand potential phenotypes of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) to better inform future research efforts and treatments; this exploratory R21 project using OA Initiative (OAI) data will investigate novel methodology to support phenotyping in KOA. Successful treatments for OA will need to be targeted to, and tested in, specifically chosen OA phenotypes. Our hypothesis is that an understanding of KOA phenotypes, a key step toward Precision Medicine in OA, will lead to more successful clinical studies in the long-term. To approach this important clinical problem, we propose a project in which we will apply innovative machine learning methods and validation strategies to data from the large, publicly available OAI cohort. We will leverage this large dataset, along with local expertise in statistics, biostatistics and machine learning methodology, to tackle the problem of phenotyping this heterogeneous disease. In Aim 1, we will utilize a data-driven, unsupervised learning approach, to cluster features that best define and discriminate among phenotypes of KOA in the OAI dataset, using biclustering and a novel significance test (SigClust) developed by co-I Marron. For Aim 2, we will test specific hypotheses of relevance to OA outcomes, such as differences between those with and without OA, or those who do or do not develop new or worsening disease, using another set of machine learning methods (Direction-projection-permutation [DiProPerm] hypothesis testing, and Distance-Weighted Discrimination [DWD]), also developed by co-I Marron, in the full cohort and in any identified clusters from Aim 1. In order to address these aims, this proposal involves interdisciplinary collaborations among experts in statistics, biostatistics, computer science, rheumatology, and epidemiology. This work will significantly impact the field by fulfilling a critical need to accurately define OA phenotypes, discover the key features associated with these phenotypes, link phenotype subgroups to underlying mechanisms and use this information to inform and focus future clinical studies. In the long term, we expect that this strategy will lead to more personalized and successful management of the millions of people affected by OA. Project narrative Osteoarthritis is an enormous and increasing public health problem, and like many other chronic conditions it is not a single disease but a heterogeneous condition consisting of multiple subgroups, or phenotypes, with differing underlying mechanisms. The lack of appreciation of this heterogeneity has contributed to the failure of all attempts to date to develop disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs; future trials will need to target specific OA phenotypes. There is a critical need to define and understand phenotypes in OA and link these to outcomes, leading to more personalized and successful management of this common and debilitating disease.",Application of advanced methodology to osteoarthritis phenotyping,10083187,R21AR074685,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Arthritis', 'Biomechanics', 'Biometry', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee Injuries', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Non obese', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Progressive Disease', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research Methodology', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk Factors', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'common treatment', 'computer science', 'demographics', 'design', 'disability', 'drug development', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'improved', 'injured', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'joint destruction', 'large datasets', 'loss of function', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'statistics', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R21,2021,160567
"VR-Based Evaluation and Training System for Emergency Responders and Managers Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR) systems are increasingly being utilized as training platforms for complex, extremely demanding or rarely executed tasks. Often, VR systems focus primarily on delivering increasingly realistic scenarios for training purposes without any capability to assess or refine trainee performance in situ. Our novel VR training platform to deliver HAZMAT training not only delivers realistic scenarios, but also measures and evaluates performance using scientifically validated measures of variables associated with both individual and team performance. The advantage of our approach is to immerse first responders in HAZMAT emergency scenarios that are realistic and also designed to focus on measurement and refinement of specific areas of performance. Key contributors to performance among emergency responders and managers were identified by an extensive review of the literature and subsequent tested for association by psychometric assessment of over three hundred emergency responders. A subset of 18 highly associated contributors were then identified through statistical analysis of survey results. These contributors can be measurably represented in VR Training scenario elements. Performance related to each can then be measured and assessed for individual or team trainees. These refined key contributors can then be validated on larger, more diverse samples of emergency responders using the beta version of our proposed VR-based system. Our VR system is also a configurable platform that enables the evaluation and training of a wide range of skills needed by distinct roles (police, firefighters, EMTs, etc.) in diverse scenarios such as biosafety spills, HAZMAT disasters and bioterrorism threats. Also, HAZMAT disasters that are rare or very difficult/costly to create real world training events can be more easily and cost effectively mastered. Scenarios also can be dynamically modulated by trainer input in real-time, or by computerized Artificial Intelligence analysis of performance and trainee real-time physiological measures to rapidly optimize specific key contributor performance of individuals and teams. Rapid, efficient and effective training of emergency responders serves the ultimate goal of minimizing potential catastrophic consequences of these events.

"Elucidating the role of the gut metagenome in hypertension. Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death world-wide. The primary modifiable risk factor for CVD is hypertension (HTN), which is exacerbated by high sodium intake. One third of Americans are hypertensive, of which half exhibit salt-sensitive HTN. Additionally, 12% of HTN patients do not respond to treatment using standard medications. Taken together, these statistics highlight the critical need to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the development of HTN for the design of alternative treatment options. The gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases including HTN. This project is designed to identify HTN- exacerbating or protective bacteria and their associated metabolic genes to inform the design of microbiome-based therapeutics for the treatment of HTN. Our preliminary results demonstrate that severe HTN induced by salt consumption correlates with shifts in the gut microbial community of Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) rats. Therefore, we tested the potential for the gut microbiota to affect HTN by performing a fecal material transfer (FMT) from hypertensive Dahl SS into HTN-resistant rats. We demonstrated that the microbiome was sufficient to exacerbate HTN in recipients and corresponded with statistically significant shifts in the gut microbiome. These results lead us to hypothesize that the gut microbiota directly influences HTN. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of bacterial supplementation during onset of HTN in the Dahl SS rat model. Predetermined strains identified from our preliminary experiments will be grown in vitro and transferred into SS Dahl rats and the effect on blood pressure and kidney damage will be evaluated. Potential mechanisms through which the bacteria influence the severity of HTN will be explored by measuring metabolite production, evaluating gut barrier function, and identifying shifts in the gut microbiome. Aim 2 will utilize machine learning to identify specific gut bacteria and metabolic genes that serve as signatures for the severity of HTN. Experiments in this aim will exploit shotgun metagenomic sequencing and computational approaches to identify specific bacteria and metabolic genes associated with HTN. Their use as predictive biomarkers for HTN will be validated by PCR-based analysis. This work will take place in the laboratory of Dr. John Kirby in the Department of Microbiology & Immunology (M&I) at the Medical College of Wisconsin, a highly collaborative and stimulating environment that is well equipped to perform the proposed aims. The Department of M&I offers a state-of-the-art educational program and various opportunities to explore alternative career pathways. We have designed a complementary training plan for my scientific and professional growth that will position me to reach my goal of becoming an independent biomedical scientist. In all, this project is critical for my advancement as a Latina woman in biomedical research, the field of HTN research, and the generation of microbiome-based therapeutics for CVD. Project Narrative Hypertension (HTN) is the primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of death world-wide. While the gut microbiome has been implicated in many diseases, a mechanism by which the microbiota influence HTN remain unknown. This project is designed to identify specific bacteria, metabolic genes, and potential mechanisms by which the microbiota influence HTN.

"Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 14 million individuals in the US and over 300 million adults worldwide. The disease is characterized by joint pain and functional limitations and is associated with poor health- related quality of life and increased healthcare utilization. OA of the hips and knees ranks as the 11th highest contributor to global disability. Despite the clinical and economic impact of knee OA, no disease-modifying agents are currently available; current treatments are limited to symptom control and are only modestly efficacious. While several promising treatments are in the pipeline, developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We urgently need to identify the right patient for the right treatment to ensure that new therapies are being tested on the appropriate population. This proposal aims to use machine learning methods to address gaps in our understanding of disease heterogeneity in knee OA. We will use publicly available data from the FNIH OA Biomarkers Consortium project. This study of 600 subjects with knee OA includes over 200 parameters that describe the joint structure and disease severity, including measures of cartilage, bone, ligaments, menisci, and inflammation. An unsupervised learning approach using model-based clustering will be used to distinguish disease phenotypes. To implement phenotyping in practice a minimal set of biomarkers must be identified that meets the challenges of both predictive accuracy and feasibility. Thus the second aim will investigate variable selection methods in model-based clustering in order to identify important variables and develop a prediction model to determine phenotype. Finally, a supervised machine learning approach via super learning will investigate algorithms to predict disease progression. The applicant, Dr. Jamie Collins, is a biostatistician at the Orthopedic and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Dr. Collins is a committed investigator in rheumatology research with eight first author publications in the field. She holds a career development award from the Rheumatology Research Foundation and pilot funding from the Brigham Research Institute. This proposal will provide protected time and rigorous training so that the applicant can expand her current biostatistical skill set to encompass the burgeoning fields of data science and machine learning. She will take coursework at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and will have access to courses, seminars, and training provided by the Brigham Research Institute and the Harvard Catalyst Program. The applicant will be supported by mentorship from Drs. Elena Losina and Tuhina Neogi, and input from the advisory committee of Drs. Tianxi Cai, Jeffrey Duryea, Ali Guermazi, Tina Kapur, Virginia Kraus, Katherine Liao, and Kurt Spindler. The research and training proposed in this award will address critical research gaps in our understanding of OA heterogeneity and progression. This will set Dr. Collins on the path towards independence and her long-term career objective of being an independent investigator with a focus on applying advanced analytic methods in OA research. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disabling disease that affects millions of people worldwide; there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies capable of providing symptom control and arresting structural progression.

"Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Timely diagnostics for fungal infections are sorely needed to guide effective therapy. Invasive fungal infections are increasing in prevalence, causing millions of deaths each year worldwide, and drug resistance poses a rising threat. Due in large part to slow, outmoded diagnostics that require days of culture to identify the pathogen and report its antifungal susceptibility profile, mortality from invasive fungal infections can exceed 40%. This in turn leads clinicians to rely on empiric and prophylactic use of antifungals that may be ineffective, cause needless toxicity, and select for resistance. Rapid precision diagnostic assays are critically needed to improve patient outcomes and guide efficient deployment of our limited antifungal arsenal.  To address this urgent public health need, in response to a specific funding opportunity announcement on “Advancing Development of Rapid Fungal Diagnostics” (PA-19-080), this proposal describes a strategy for rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing based on RNA signatures. This approach relies on a novel paradigm for pathogen diagnostics, recently validated in bacteria and implemented on a simple, robust, quantitative, multiplexed fluorescent hybridization assay on the NanoString platform. Detection of highly abundant, conserved ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences enables broad-range, ultrasensitive pathogen identification. Meanwhile, quantifying key messenger RNA levels following antimicrobial exposure enables phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST), relying on the principle that cells that are dying or growth- arrested are transcriptionally distinct within minutes from those that are not (Bhattacharyya et al, Nature Medicine, in press). Because this approach to AST measures gene expression as an early phenotypic change in susceptible strains, it does not rely on foreknowledge of the genetic basis of resistance in order to classify susceptibility, and can thus be generalized to any pathogen-antimicrobial pair.  This proposal aims to first computationally design and experimentally validate a set of hybridization probes to uniquely recognize the 18S and 28S rRNA from each of 48 clinically significant fungal pathogens that together cause the vast majority of invasive fungal infections in humans. Preliminary data show that these rRNA targets are abundant enough to detect a single fungal cell without amplification, enabling ultrasensitive detection in <4 hours directly from clinical samples. Next, RNA-Seq will be used to profile transcriptional changes in 12 common fungal pathogens for which resistance has important clinical consequences in response to treatment with the three major classes of antifungals. Antifungal-responsive transcripts that best classify fungal isolates as susceptible or resistant will be chosen by adapting machine learning algorithms that were developed for this purpose in bacteria. Finally, both approaches will be piloted on simulated and real clinical fungal samples. Preliminary data suggest that these approaches can identify fungi within <4 hours from a primary sample, and deliver AST results within <6 hours of a positive fungal culture. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fungal infections are common, increasing in frequency and severity, and cause considerable morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of invasive fungal infection, and prompt initiation of effective antifungal therapy, are key to improving patient outcomes. This proposal aims to adapt a novel paradigm for rapid pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing through the quantitative detection of RNA signatures to transform fungal diagnostics.","Rapid fungal identification and antifungal susceptibility testing through quantitative, multiplexed RNA detection",10183157,R01AI153405,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Antibiotics', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Antimicrobial susceptibility', 'Aspergillus', 'Azoles', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bacterial RNA', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Candida', 'Candida auris', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Class Zygomycetes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Microbiology', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Drug resistance', 'Frequencies', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'Mycoses', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Polyenes', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA, Ribosomal, 28S', 'Reporting', 'Resistance', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Skin', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sputum', 'Swab', 'Symptoms', 'Taxonomy', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Transcript', 'Urine', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'clinically significant', 'computational pipelines', 'design', 'detection limit', 'detection platform', 'diagnostic assay', 'effective therapy', 'efflux pump', 'experience', 'fungus', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'nano-string', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'overexpression', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic fungus', 'patient population', 'personalized diagnostics', 'prophylactic', 'random forest', 'rapid test', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIAID,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R01,2021,659282
"Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis is a major health concern with over 200 million people with active urogenital or ocular infection each year worldwide. Chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria with a unique biphasic developmental cycle. A better understanding of that biphasic cycle can lead to inhibitors that are specific for chlamydial infection in order to avoid overuse of antibiotics. Individual Chlamydia are too small and tightly packed to be spatially separated with conventional light microscopes, and 3D SEM is too labor-intensive for inhibitor studies. We will use a new sample preparation method that physically expands the sample with polymers termed ""Expansion Microscopy"" or ExM. Expanded samples can then be imaged with a traditional confocal microscope, and high-content analysis performed automatically using machine learning methods such as pixel classification and novelty detection. Prepared samples can be imaged and analyzed in under an hour instead of the multiple days required for 3D SEM. This R03 grant will develop an innovative high-content screening platform, called Expansion Microscopy Aided Phenotyping (ExMAP), for the quantification of changes in Chlamydia development after treatment. ExMAP can be paired with Chlamydia transformed with promoters for EUO and IhtA (RB cell types) and the promoters for HctB and Tarp (EB cell types). The combination of expansion microscopy, machine learning, and chlamydial transformation will make ExMAP a powerful tool for research on both the developmental cycle and new therapy development. Project Narrative This project will develop a new high-content platform, termed ExMAP, that will physically expand the sample of interest and then utilize machine learning for image analysis. At the completion of the project, we expect to have developed a new method for the study of the Chlamydia developmental cycle and inhibitors that disrupt that cycle.",Phenotype screens of Chlamydia Inclusions,10128374,R03AI146437,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acrylates', 'Aftercare', 'Agonist', 'Antibiotics', 'Applications Grants', 'Bacteria', 'Cells', 'Chlamydia', 'Chlamydia Infections', 'Chlamydia genome', 'Chlamydia trachomatis', 'Chloramphenicol', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Eye Infections', 'Gel', 'Genitourinary System Infection', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Iron Chelating Agents', 'Lead', 'Light Microscope', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'PF4 Gene', 'Penicillins', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Polymers', 'Preparation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'SIRT1 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sodium', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'cell type', 'chlamydia vaccine', 'human pathogen', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pathogen', 'promoter', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule inhibitor', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIAID,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,77243
"Deep learning and topological approaches to identify kidney tissue features associated with adverse outcomes after nephrectomy ABSTRACT Pathologic assessment of kidney biopsy tissue remains the best predictor of adverse outcomes in patients with kidney diseases. These features are largely independent of disease etiology and are not well reflected in non- invasive tests (e.g. serum creatinine and albuminuria). Quantitative assessment of these parameters is time consuming and maybe flawed by heterogeneity of pathologic features within kidney tissue. We propose to evaluate and optimize computational image analysis approaches to support pathologic analysis of large pieces of cancer-free kidney tissue from patients who underwent nephrectomy which we have collected (n > 220). Computer-assisted analysis of glomerular phenotypes in these samples show that morphometric features in glomeruli without obvious pathology precede established pathologic changes. We hypothesize that evaluation of cancer-free kidney tissue will inform about subclinical damage in the remaining kidney which is associated with relevant pathologic and clinical parameters. We propose to assess glomeruli, arteries and tubuli, and determine the spatial inter-relationship of the assessed features within the kidney tissue. The examination of significantly larger pieces of kidney tissue than those obtained by needle biopsy allows to include 20 times more glomeruli (nephrectomy samples: avrg. 256 glomeruli/sample; needle biopsy: avrg. 13/sample) with the vast majority considered “normal appearing” as per standard pathologic criteria. In addition, these samples include a significant larger number of blood vessels (nephrectomy samples: avrg. 18 arteries/sample; needle biopsy: avrg. 1/sample) allowing a more robust evaluation of the vasculature. We propose to apply and optimize our detection and segmentation approach to detect glomeruli, arteries and tubular segments to train convolutional neural networks and use topological image analysis to automate the identification of visual and sub-visual features. In addition, we will assess the spatial relationship between individual features (glomeruli, arteries and tubular segments and features of the same category, i.e. globally sclerosed glomeruli, arteries with hyalinosis, atrophied tubuli) within the section. To determine reproducibility of our approach, we will assess a second tissue section from a separate part of the same samples. Specifically, we propose an algorithmic detection and characterization of kidney features using deep learning, a topological image analysis for discovery of novel sub-visual features in kidney tissue images and to determine spatial relatedness of these features. If successful, we will validate our analytical approach in future independent studies. For this purpose, we are already prospectively collecting kidney tissue and longitudinal clinical data from consented patients undergoing nephrectomies, allowing association of specific features with clinical relevant outcomes. LAY NARRATIVE Patients who have one kidney removed because of cancer or other reasons, are at risk of experiencing kidney failure after the surgery due to damage to the remaining kidney, but it is difficult to know why the kidney fails and how to prevent or treat it. Evaluation of kidney tissue is the best way to determine how strong or weak the kidney is at time of surgery and how to best manage kidney-related complications afterwards. We propose a detailed analysis of pieces of tissue not affected by the tumor from the removed kidney using advanced computer-assisted analysis methods (“convolutional neural networks” and “topological image analysis”) to more accurately evaluate the status of the kidney, predict what will happen to the kidney function in the future and thereby guide therapy.",Deep learning and topological approaches to identify kidney tissue features associated with adverse outcomes after nephrectomy,10229784,R21DK126329,"['Acute', 'Albuminuria', 'Algorithms', 'Arteries', 'Atrophic', 'Blood Vessels', 'Categories', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computer Assisted', 'Consent', 'Consumption', 'Contralateral', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Needles', 'Nephrectomy', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Serum', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tubular formation', 'Visual', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'histological stains', 'improved', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney imaging', 'morphometry', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'renal damage', 'serial imaging', 'spatial relationship', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2021,234000
"Harnessing Big Data to Identify Effective Peripheral Artery Disease Treatments in Chronic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peripheral artery disease (PAD), characterized by diseased arteries to the limbs, affects 200 million people worldwide and 9 million people in the U.S. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 20 million people in the U.S. and confers a markedly higher risk for PAD. Yet patients with CKD are less likely to have revascularization procedures and are more likely to undergo lower extremity amputation than patients without CKD. In addition to a high prevalence of traditional risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, patients with CKD have other unique risk factors such as chronic inflammation or uremia, which in turn can lead to more aggressive PAD at a younger age. Therefore, patients with CKD need dedicated study. Our overarching goal is to help close these evidence gaps and address these limitations by harnessing the power of Optum Clinformatics Data Mart, which includes over 7 billion claims records on over 83 million unique lives from all 50 states spanning 2005-2019. Our secondary goal is to facilitate future PAD studies using real-world data by leveraging the power of natural language processing to improve our ability to accurately and automatically ascertain PAD from large electronic health record databases. Our innovative algorithm will be of particular importance among subgroups where clinical trial evidence is limited, such as in advanced CKD. Our proposal has the Specific Aims. Aim 1: To evaluate lower extremity revascularization in patients with non-dialysis- requiring CKD. We hypothesize that patients with CKD undergoing surgical versus endovascular revascularization will have longer initial hospitalization, but fewer subsequent major adverse limb events. AIM 2: To evaluate antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications after lower extremity revascularization in patients with non-dialysis-requiring CKD. We hypothesize that real-world patients with CKD treated with antiplatelet medications or direct oral anticoagulants after lower extremity revascularization will have higher rates of bleeding but lower rates of major adverse limb events. AIM 3: To develop an algorithm that accurately and automatically ascertains PAD from electronic health record databases. We hypothesize that a natural language processing-approach applied to diagnostic vascular testing reports will have better test performance (i.e. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) for identifying PAD than a traditional approach that uses administrative billing codes. Manual chart review will serve as the gold standard. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects millions of people around the world, causing decreased mobility, non- healing wounds, gangrene and amputations. Patients with chronic kidney disease have a higher risk for PAD and its complications, but relatively little is known about what treatments are effective in this population. Our project aims to narrow some of these knowledge gaps to improve PAD treatment practices for patients with chronic kidney disease.",Harnessing Big Data to Identify Effective Peripheral Artery Disease Treatments in Chronic Kidney Disease,10180665,R01HL151351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Anticoagulants', 'Arteries', 'Aspirin', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Mart', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gangrene', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Manuals', 'Medial', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modernization', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nephrology', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uremia', 'calcification', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'virtual']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,354432
"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",10075930,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'diagnostic technologies', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'hepatocellular injury', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,448421
"A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy Cancer treatments can cause a variety of poorly-managed symptoms and toxicities that can impair quality of life and functioning and lead to early discontinuation of life-prolonging medical treatment. The goals of the proposed study are (1) to develop a novel mobile sensing system to passively monitor symptom burden during chemotherapy and (2) to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using this system to recommend patient-provider communication. To accomplish Aim 1, we will enroll 200 oncology patients starting a new chemotherapy regimen and will collect smartphone and wearable sensor data continuously as well as daily patient-reported symptoms via smartphones for 90 days. Using machine learning methods, we will retrospectively analyze data from the first 100 participants and develop a generalizable and parsimonious population-level model to identify severe symptom days. For the second 100 participants, we will run these computational models in real-time and prospectively evaluate the accuracy of our classifications relative to patient-reported symptoms. For Aim 2, we will enroll 50 patients in a prospective single-arm trial of a system that uses inferences based on sensing and machine learning to recommend contact with providers and will evaluate patient accrual, attrition, and compliance as well as information from both patients and their providers about acceptability and perceived usefulness of the system. The scientific premise of this proposal is that mobile sensing of subtle fluctuations in behavior coupled with real-time computational modeling could enable earlier detection and ultimately better management of severe symptoms during cancer treatment. The proposed project builds on our prior research and completes the necessary development and feasibility work to support a large multisite trial comparing the mobile sensing system to standard of care to determine effects on symptom burden, quality of life, health care utilization, and survival. Public health relevance: Symptoms during cancer treatment are common, compromise patient quality of life and ability to tolerate treatment, and often go undetected at clinic visits. This project aims to combine smartphone and wearable sensor data with machine learning to remotely monitor symptoms during chemotherapy and to develop a system that automatically recommends patient-provider contact when severe symptoms are detected.",A mobile sensing system to monitor symptoms during chemotherapy,10218121,R37CA242545,"['Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enrollment', 'Goals', 'Health Status', 'Heart Rate', 'Impairment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Notification', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer therapy', 'care delivery', 'care outcomes', 'chemotherapy', 'common treatment', 'feasibility testing', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'mobile computing', 'multi-site trial', 'novel', 'patient-clinician communication', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'remote monitoring', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'sensor', 'standard of care', 'symptom management', 'trial comparing', 'wearable sensor technology']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R37,2021,361146
"The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health Abstract My research in health economics has focused on how information and targeted consumer cost-sharing influences how patients choose providers and the financial savings of incentivizing patients to choose low-price providers. I have also examined the opposite side of the market, how patient use of information and targeted consumer incentives spurs provider price competition. These topics provided the framework for my research as a PhD student in Health Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and I continue to build on these topics while a policy researcher at the RAND Corporation. A natural next step for my career is to expand this line of research but in a more in-depth manner and using more advanced statistical methods. Performing mentored research in these areas will help me successfully make the transition from directed to independent research. The proposed study will help me to (1) contribute to a deeper understanding of patient health effects of an innovative insurance benefit design that is particularly relevant for the aging population; (2) continue to build capabilities working with large medical claims data sets and develop expertise in innovative statistical methods from different disciplines; (3) gain training in aging-related health-services research; (4) expand my exposure to the aging, health economics, and health services research communities; and (5) develop my abilities as an independent health services researcher and build the foundations to successfully compete for R01-level grants.  In this project, I propose to examine whether reference pricing for colonoscopies and pharmaceuticals decreases adherence to recommended colorectal cancer screening and medication therapies among the near- elderly population. I will also examine the impact of reference pricing on patient health outcomes and the aging process. To do so, I intend to apply novel machine-learning statistical methods that have been recently developed in the computer science and statistics fields. As part of this proposal, I have built a formal training plan to develop expertise in these methods. This project will provide me with the flexibility and support to develop a long-term research agenda that focuses on using innovative statistical methods to evaluate the comprehensive effects of consumer cost- sharing programs. Although this study focuses on a single cost- sharing program, reference pricing, the skills I gain through this award will allow me to independently lead evaluations of future benefit designs. The application of machine-learning methods to the setting of reference pricing will provide a framework that I or other researchers can use to evaluate other insurance benefit designs or alternative patient populations. ! Narrative An increasingly popular insurance benefit design, reference pricing, provides targeted financial incentives for consumers to receive care at low-cost providers. While the financial savings from reference pricing programs are well-known, the health impacts have yet to be studied. The proposed career grant will apply machine learning techniques to develop a long-term research agenda focused on understanding the patient health effects of reference pricing for colonoscopies and medication therapies, which are services that are especially relevant for the aging population. !",The Effects of Insurance Benefit Design Innovation on Patient Health,10188375,K01AG061274,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Colonoscopy', 'Communities', 'Cost Sharing', 'Data Set', 'Deductibles', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discipline', 'Elderly', 'Employee', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Rate', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Benefits', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Internal Medicine', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Preventive service', 'Price', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retirement', 'Savings', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Side', 'Statistical Methods', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'aging population', 'asthmatic patient', 'career', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'comorbidity', 'compliance behavior', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'financial incentive', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'health economics', 'health plan', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'programs', 'response', 'semiparametric', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'treatment effect']",NIA,RAND CORPORATION,K01,2021,129913
"Rethinking Electronic Fetal Monitoring to Improve Perinatal Outcomes and Reduce Frequency of Operative Vaginal and Cesarean Deliveries The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to fetal hypoxia and ischemia. Its established weaknesses include: 1) the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns and 2) the widespread use of unproven surrogates for relevant fetal hypoxic and/or ischemic injury such as umbilical arterial pH, intrapartum stillbirth, newborn Apgar scores and neonatal seizures. This technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with cerebral palsy. EFM as it is presently used in the clinical setting has been associated with an extraordinary increase in the use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery. No functional algorithm has yet been developed that integrates clinical data collected in the antepartum period and during labor and any other patient specific data with the results of EFM. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of EFM data, especially under real world conditions and in real time where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes. It is anticipated that the proposed research will result in significantly decreased use of operative vaginal delivery and cesarean delivery while more precisely defining the fetus at risk for developing metabolic acidosis and long term neurologic injury. The essential role of electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) of the fetal heart rate (FHR) during labor is to prevent adverse outcomes due to oxygen deficiency, but its weaknesses almost all stem from the obstetrician’s highly subjective visual interpretations of the signal patterns. The widespread use of this technology over the past 50 years has not been shown to decrease stillbirths or reduce the numbers of infants with severe hypoxic/ischemic neurological disorders, but it has been associated with an extraordinary increase in cesarean delivery rates. The main objective of the proposed research is to use recent breakthroughs in machine learning to drive the development of predictive analytics to support and improve the interpretation of FHR monitoring data, especially under real world conditions where clinicians must make timely decisions about interventions to prevent adverse outcomes.

"Point-of-care antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells ABSTRACT Antibiotic resistance has become a significant public health threat. To combat the problem, a rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) technology is needed to provide timely diagno- sis of resistant infections and delivery of accurate antibiotic treatment at primary health-care settings, includ- ing hospitals and point-of-care (POC). The present project aims to develop a point-of-care AST (POCASTTM) technology based on a large-image-volume microscopy technique that enables direct detection of individual bacterial cells in clinical samples without culturing or pathogen isolation, and a machine-learning model that allows fast determination of pathogen and susceptibility. To establish the technology, the project will focus on urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs affect millions of people annually, and the pathogens that usually cause UTIs are the organisms that pose the highest threat of antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem- resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteri- aceae. This project will focus on: 1) developing the large-image-volume microscopy and machine learning model for simultaneous tracking of multi-phenotypic features of single bacterial cells directly in patient urine sample, and performing rapid automatic pathogen ID and AST for UTIs; 2) building prototype instrument, and 3) validating the instrument for UTIs using large scale clinical samples. Successful development and validation of the tech- nology will enable precise antibiotic prescription on the same day of patient visit. The project will be carried out by a multidisciplinary team with expertise in biosensors (Biodesign Center for Bioelectronics and Biosensors, ASU), microbiology and infectious diseases (Biodesign Center for Immuno- therapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy, ASU), biomedical instrument development and production (Biosensing Instrument Inc.), and clinical testing (Clinical Microbiology Laboratory, Mayo Clinic). ! PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a culture-independent technology for point-of-care diagnosis of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in urinary tract infections within 3 hours, by imaging urine samples directly with an innovative large- image-volume imaging technique and analyzing the data with a machine-learning model.

"An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine Project Summary  This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable technology that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. Accordingly, we will address fundamental and intermeshed engineering bottlenecks and scientific questions at sensor, device, and data analytics levels to realize a sweat-based wearable bioanalytical technology, equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities. To illustrate our technology’s transformative potential, we will particularly position it to monitor a panel of nutrients and indicators of the metabolic and disease state that are relevant in cystic fibrosis (CF, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), in order to enable individualized nutritional support, which is central to the CF treatment.  Accordingly, in the first phase (R21), we will develop microsensor arrays targeting glucose, triglyceride, and β- hydroxybutyrate. We will incorporate our readily developed auxiliary sensing modalities (sweat sodium, chloride, pH, and sweat secretion rate sensing interfaces) to enable the in-situ characterization of the secretion profile (which is useful for the normalization of sweat readings and tracking of the CF progression). In parallel to these engineering efforts, we will conduct sweat characterization experiments to study the effect of the secretion rate on analyte partitioning from blood into sweat. These datasets will be augmented with state-of-art machine learning algorithms to formulate a dedicated analytical framework that accounts for sweat secretion variabilities and determines optimal sweat secretion condition(s) to provide undistorted and physiologically meaningful sweat readings.  In the second phase (R33), we will establish the clinical utility of our technology by demonstrating the ability to non-invasively track the target nutrients’ temporal profiles in relation to their circulating levels in blood (in both healthy subjects and CF patients and through simple/mixed meal-modulated studies). Accordingly, we will first measure the sweat and blood analytes’ excursion profiles after controlled single/binary combinations of nutrients intake and develop a machine-learning based algorithm to correlate the sweat analyte readouts to their circulating concentrations. Then we will assess and characterize the predictive utility of our solution in the context of complex nutritional supplement studies. Upon its validation, we will recruit a cohort of CF patients and perform a longitudinal randomized nutritional support study to demonstrate the enabling remote patient monitoring capabilities rendered by our solution.  The success of this work will represent a groundbreaking contribution towards the development of strategies to enable precision nutrition and personalized medicine. Project Narrative This proposal aims to enable precision nutrition by creating a wearable sweat bioanalytical technology— equipped with autonomous sweat secretion modulation, biofluid management, and analysis capabilities—that can be scaled across the general population to non-invasively track the diurnal profiles of a panel of putative circulating nutrients and biomarkers. By deploying this technology in clinical studies (with a particular focus on cystic fibrosis, the most common inherited multisystemic disorder), we will study and establish the correlation of the sweat readings to the circulating analytes and in response to nutritional interventions. This technology will provide a comprehensive and physiologically rich view of the individuals’ well-being/disease and nutritional status, rendering a personalized solution for effective treatment and nutritional support.","An Autonomous, Non-invasive, and Bioanalytics-enabled Wearable Platform for Precision Nutrition and Personalized Medicine",10198604,R21DK128711,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Engineering', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Engineering', 'General Population', 'Glucose', 'Health', 'Hour', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Inherited', 'Intake', 'Iontophoresis', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional Support', 'Nutritional status', 'Periodicity', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reading', 'Sampling', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Study Subject', 'Sweat Glands', 'Sweat test', 'System', 'Technology', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'beta-Hydroxybutyrate', 'cofactor', 'cohort', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'dietary supplements', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'human subject', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microsensor', 'multidisciplinary', 'operation', 'personalized medicine', 'precision nutrition', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'remote patient monitoring', 'response', 'sensor', 'success', 'targeted biomarker', 'wearable device']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,210796
"Personalized Statin Treatment Plan to Optimize Clinical Outcomes Using Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY An estimated 47% of Americans 65 years of age and older take statins, which are highly effective in lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and reducing all-cause mortality. Unfortunately, ~50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain these critical benefits because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation. There, Statin discontinuation has been identified as a major public-health concern due to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs associated with ASCVD. In clinical practice, statin-associated symptoms (SAS) often result in dose reduction or discontinuation of these life-saving medications. Currently, physicians employ reactive strategies to manage SAS concerns after they manifest, such as offering an alternative statin treatment plan (e.g., reducing dosage or changing medication) or a `statin holiday'. However, with numerous statin treatment strategies available and no means of optimizing their match to a given patient, physician decision-making is based on minimal patient data elements. Moreover, using a single patient's data to identify the optimal statin regimen and treatment plan is inadequate to ensure that the harms of statin use are minimized and the benefits are maximized. A decision- support system, by contrast, can use a vast number of variables from a large number of patients (“big data”) to match an optimal statin treatment plan to an individual patient prospectively. We propose to use complex patient information to develop and test an effective predictive model and tool, the personalized statin treatment plan (PSTP) platform, which could be used by physicians to optimize personalized statin treatment to minimize harms (SAS and statin discontinuation) while at the same time maximizing benefits (LDL reduction). The proposed study leverages data from the OptumLabs Data Warehouse (which includes more than 20 years of insurance claims and electronic health records data from more than 150 million patients across the United States), as well as clinical trial simulations, for model development, validation, and evaluation. We will address the following specific aims: 1) Develop and validate a deep-learning model to predict both SAS and statin discontinuation using linked insurance claims and EHR data; 2) Develop and validate the PSTP platform to identify statin treatment plans that optimize both LDL reduction (benefit) and SAS and statin discontinuation (harm) for a given patient profile; and 3) Evaluate the PSTP relative to current and guideline-driven practices using CTS to assess clinical benefits and harms. The proposed study will produce a precision-medicine tool to empower physicians to make proactive clinical decisions regarding statin treatment planning (i.e., selecting the statin drug and dosage optimized for a particular patient to maximize LDL reduction and minimize statin discontinuation and SAS) before any statin is prescribed. The implementation of such a tool would substantially improve public health by reducing statin discontinuation and sub-optimal clinical outcomes inherent in current reactive statin-prescribing strategies based on non-personalized statin treatment plans. PROJECT NARRATIVE About 50% of patients prescribed statins do not obtain critical benefits in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and reducing all-cause mortality because they discontinue use within 1 year of treatment initiation largely due to statin-associated symptoms.

"The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony Project Summary/Abstract Despite significant advances in ventilator management, mortality from the acute respiratory distress syn- drome (ARDS) remains unacceptably high. Mechanical ventilation with large tidal volume, high pressure ven- tilation, and repeated alveolar collapse can injure the lung, called ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). Defined as the inappropriate timing and delivery of a breath in response to a patient effort, ventilator dyssynchrony (VD) may potentiate VILI. This proposal outlines a 5-year training programing including mentoring, formal didactics, and practical research experiences which positions Dr. Sottile for a successful clinical research career examining ventilator dyssynchrony (VD), its impact on ventilator induced lung injury (VILI), and its optimal management. An integrated curriculum will optimize an automated VD detection algorithm, delineate which types of VD are deleterious, and determine the ideal ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD and improve patient outcomes. This experience will provide Dr. Sottile with the necessary tools to be a leader in signal analysis, ventilator dyssynchrony, advanced mathematical modeling, and critical care research. This program will consist of formal mentoring from four renowned experts in machine learning, mechanical ventilation, critical care research, and modeling of dynamic systems. In addition, coursework in clinical sciences, machine learning, and advanced mathematical modeling will build the theoretical foundation to apply these techniques. This structured curriculum will help Dr. Sottile gain expertise in the computerized detection of VD from real-time ventilator data, the pathophysiology of VD, and the modeling of complex, temporally dynamic, biological systems. The formal curriculum will coincide with three practical experiences. First, Dr. Sottile will optimize his already developed VD identification algorithm to detect additional types of VD that may be injurious to the lung. Second, he will identify which types of VD are associated with deleterious ventilator mechanics. Finally, he will deter- mine the personalized ventilator and sedation strategies to minimize VD, VILI, and the negative consequences of over sedation using linear optimization and lagged linear correlation to account for the dynamic nature of patient physiology. The result of the proposed studies will develop a computerized algorithm to detect seven types of VD, identify which types of VD are most likely to propagate VILI, and determine the optimal ventilator and sedation strategies to improve individual patient outcomes. This will leave Dr. Sottile and the study team positioned to conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing computer-predicted individualized ventilator and se- dation strategies compared to the current standard of care. If successful, this will potentially to revolutionize the use of mechanical ventilation by tailoring evidenced-based therapies to the individual patient. Project Narrative Despite over 50 years of research, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) accounts of over 10% of ICU admissions. Despite current treatment strategies focused on reducing ventilator induced lung injury through low tidal volume ventilation or prone position, mortality remains over 30%. This proposal seeks to understand how patient-ventilator interactions may propagate lung injury and will determine optimal treatment strategies to improve patient- ventilator interactions, decrease lung injury, and improve patient outcomes.","The Detection, Quantification, and Management of Ventilator Dyssynchrony",10080102,K23HL145011,"['Accounting', 'Admission activity', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Algorithms', 'Alveolar', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Dysbarism', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial', 'Esophagus', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Induction of neuromuscular blockade', 'Injury', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manometry', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prone Position', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sedation procedure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Tidal Volume', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training Programs', 'Ventilator', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'biological systems', 'career', 'computerized', 'dynamic system', 'esophagus pressure', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'lung injury', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized strategies', 'pressure', 'programs', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing', 'ventilation']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K23,2021,169654
"Selection of Flow Modulation Protocols for Patients on Continuous Flow Ventricular Assist Devices (CF-VADs) PROJECT SUMMARY A major concern with continuous flow ventricular assist devices (CF-VADs) is the resulting non-physiological flow with diminished pulsatility which has been shown to be a major risk factor for development of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. To address this issue, flow modulation via rapid changes in pump impeller speed has been proposed as a technique to introduce ‘artificial pulsatility’. However, given the inadequacy of large animal models with recreating CF-VAD associated non-surgical bleeding events, it is still unclear if artificial pulsatility can prevent these adverse events or what level of artificial pulsatility is even necessary. To evaluate the effects of pulsatility and identify promising flow modulation approaches we developed a vascular pulse perfusion model (VPPM) to culture Human Aortic Endothelial Cells (HAECs) under conditions of normal pulsatile flow or flow with diminished pulsatility (CF-VAD support). Our rationale for modeling arterial vessels is because pulsatility primarily affects the arterial side of the circulatory system and its effects are transduced by endothelial cells that line the large arterial vessels. The VPPM was validated as relevant model via direct comparison with aortic samples of patients with and without CF-VADs. Our published data also shows that loss of pulsatility is associated with an increase in production of pro-angiogenic/inflammatory cytokines. The relevance of these results is further strengthened by supporting data from patients that experience AVMs and GI bleeding events (both CF-VAD related and due to other conditions) showing similar elevated levels of pro- angiogenic/inflammatory cytokines. The VPPM therefore provides a powerful model to evaluate artificial pulsatility in the context of CF-VAD flow modulation and determine if restoring pulse pressure and/or pulse frequency can mitigate non-surgical bleeding events. Based on recent studies that suggest that pulse pressure < 35 mmHg is a major risk factor for development of GI bleeds, we hypothesize that “Diminished pulsatility associated with ‘CF-VAD support’ results in endothelial dysfunction and pro-inflammatory/pro-angiogenic soluble factor production. These changes can be mitigated via introduction of artificial pulsatility using flow modulation strategies where pulse pressure is preserved at > 35 mmHg”. Aim1 will evaluate response of patient derived endothelial cells within the VPPM to CF-VAD flow and quantify angiogenic/inflammatory soluble factor production, Aim2 will follow patients for up to 36 months to evaluate serum levels of pro-angiogenic/pro- inflammatory cytokines and non-surgical bleeding events which will then be compared to results from in-vitro studies within the VPPM and Aim3 will evaluate different flow modulation strategies using patient-derived endothelial cells to determine most promising patient-specific approaches via comparison of hemodynamic profiles and cytokine biomarkers using deep learning approaches. Successful completion of this project will enable identification of device-based strategies to prevent non-surgical bleeding in patients on CF-VAD support. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to determine the effects of diminished pulsatility during continuous flow ventricular assist device (CF-VAD) support on human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). Changes in production of pro- angiogenic/pro-inflammatory cytokines will be used as biomarkers to evaluate the effects of loss of pulsatility and help validate new approaches to introduce artificial pulsatility in CF-VADs.",Selection of Flow Modulation Protocols for Patients on Continuous Flow Ventricular Assist Devices (CF-VADs),10116660,R01HL151663,"['Activities of Daily Living', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Aging', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antioxidants', 'Arteriovenous malformation', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelin-1', 'Endothelium', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage', 'Heart failure', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Pulsatile Flow', 'Pulse Pressure', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Refractory', 'Regulation', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Sheep', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Transducers', 'Translating', 'VWF gene', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cytokine', 'deep learning', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'novel strategies', 'operation', 'patient response', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'response', 'safety testing', 'ventricular assist device']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,535547
"Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB) The introduction of Coordinated Specialty Care (CSC) has transformed the standard of care and elevated treatment outcome goals for young individuals experiencing the initial stages of a psychotic illness (EP). The response to treatment for EP individuals receiving CSC, however, remains highly variable. A substantial proportion show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices comprising this treatment model. Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond to treatment and published data show that expert clinicians perform no better than chance. Early identification of treatment non-responders has very high clinical significance and would inform and enhance clinical decision making during the first few months of care. Surprisingly, little research has been conducted on baseline predictors of treatment outcomes in EP individuals entering CSC. During the past two decades, considerable progress has been made using neuroimaging to investigate pathophysiological processes during the early phases of illness. Furthermore, limited data suggest that fMRI measures of brain activity and PET measures of increased dopamine synthesis are related to treatment outcomes in EP. We have recently demonstrated in a moderately large sample of EP patients entering CSC that the ability to activate the frontal parietal (FP) cognitive control network (measured using fMRI during the AX- CPT task) is a significant predictor of who will meet responder criterion after one year of CSC. We propose to replicate and extend this result by examining the predictive ability of this and two other promising MRI based measures linked to pathophysiological processes related to psychosis: 1) free water diffusion tensor imaging (FW) - a putative biomarker of neuroinflammation that is increased in EP individuals, and 2) midbrain neuromelanin (NM) scans, which index midbrain dopamine, shown to be decreased in Parkinson's disease and increased in schizophrenia. Each of these measures will be used individually to predict responder status for EP participants entering CSC. In addition to these analyses we will use novel deep learning methods to optimize the prediction of treatment response in EP individuals entering CSC and to obtain new insights into the mechanisms underlying these effects. Our goal is to leverage recent progress in the development of MRI based imaging biomarkers to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform treatment decision making for all patients in order to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness. A substantial proportion of early psychosis EP individuals show minimal symptom reduction despite receiving the full range of evidence-based practices provided by coordinated specialty care (CSC). Currently, clinicians have no way to predict which EP individuals entering CSC will respond and who will not. In this project we will leverage recent progress in the development of pathophysiologically informed MRI based imaging biomarkers along with novel computational image analysis, to develop a precision medicine tool that can identify early psychosis patients entering CSC who are at high risk for non-response and thereby inform clinical decision making to optimize the recovery of young individuals following the onset of psychotic illness.",Pathophysiology Informed Biomarkers of Treatment Response in Early Psychosis (PIB),10194614,R01MH122139,"['Adjuvant', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Clozapine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Psychotherapy', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'base', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'indexing', 'ineffective therapies', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'medication compliance', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuromelanin', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'psychosocial', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'responders and non-responders', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment responders', 'treatment response', 'water diffusion', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,710640
"BIGDATA: Causal Inference in Large-Scale Time Series Project summary Large datasets generated by hospitals could have a transformative effect on medical knowledge and patient care. Yet currently the volume of data is more likely to overwhelm clinicians and the challenges of the data can overwhelm machine learning algorithms. Intensive care units (ICUs) generate data at a resolution of seconds, for the entirety of a patient's stay. Our long-term goal is to turn these data into actionable knowledge, like risk factors for a disease, early intervention targets, and real-time information to support clinical decisions. This is a broad problem, but particularly important in ICUs, which involve high stakes decisions being made in a complex environment under time pressure. We focus in particular on understanding consciousness in adults, and neurologic status in neonates. While 7% of ICU admissions are due to loss of consciousness, and degree of consciousness is critical to evaluating prognosis, making difficult choices such as when to withdraw care, and providing early interventions to improve quality of life, there are no objective or automated assessments for consciousness (adults) or neurologic status (neonates). We have shown that unresponsive patients with brain activation were twice as likely to regain the ability to follow commands compared to unresponsive patients without such activation, yet these assessments are too time consuming for regular clinical use. However we also showed that physiological data routinely collected in ICUs can be used as a proxy to classify consciousness. It is still not known why it changes and we must be sure that the patterns we find are in fact causal to avoid treating symptoms instead of a disease or launching unsuccessful clinical trials. There have been two key barriers preventing a causal understanding of consciousness. First, variables measured for each ICU patient differ, and can differ within a patient over the course of their admission. This leads to confounding when attempting to infer causal models, and has prevented learning a single model for all patients, which limits generalizability. Second, while the challenges of medical data require new methods, researchers are rarely able to rigorously evaluate and compare them, since real-world data lacks ground truth and often cannot be shared for privacy reasons. To address these challenges, we aim 1) to develop methods that learn generalizable causal models with latent variables (by intelligently sharing and combining information across patients), 2) to develop data driven simulations methods for testing machine learning algorithms while preserving privacy, and 3) to apply these methods to neonatal and neurological ICU data. We aim to create better indicators for consciousness and to uncover causes of both neurological status in ICU and its link to long-term functional outcomes. Our work turns potential weaknesses of medical data (different variables measured across individuals) into a strength, and will enable better use of large-scale observational biomedical data for real-time treatment decisions. Project Narrative Big data can form the basis for more precise, personalized, interventions for ICU patients, but it is challenging for clinicians to integrate a large number of complex signals. Our work will allow data to guide treatment by making machine learning more accurate and providing better ways of combining insights from many patients (each of whose data may be incomplete). These will aid in understanding consciousness in neurological and neonatal ICUs.",BIGDATA: Causal Inference in Large-Scale Time Series,10123124,R01LM011826,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Altered Level of Consciousness', 'Behavior assessment', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conscious', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological status', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Privacy', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unconscious State', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawing Care', 'Work', 'causal model', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'effective intervention', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neonatal patient', 'neonate', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized intervention', 'premature', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'privacy preservation', 'respiratory', 'response', 'simulation', 'stroke patient', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NLM,STEVENS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,295006
"Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy This K24 grant will provide the PI, Dr. Lin Yee Chen, a midcareer NIH-funded patient-oriented research (POR) investigator, with the protected time and support needed to (1) accelerate his current trajectory in mentoring junior clinicians and investigators who are conducting POR in cardiovascular (CV) science, (2) acquire additional training in mentoring methods, machine learning, and omics science, (3) promote his current research that aims to define the mechanisms underlying the relationship of the abnormal atrial substrate—atrial cardiomyopathy—and atrial fibrillation (AF) to ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes. Trainees in his AF Clinical Research Group will be recruited from the NIH-funded T32 training programs in the University of Minnesota's Division of Cardiology, Division of Epidemiology, and Division of Biostatistics; Department of Medicine Physician Scientist Training Program; KL2 and TL1 Programs of the CTSI; and graduate programs (MS in Clinical Research, MPH, and PhD) in the School of Public Health. For his career development, Dr. Chen will hone his mentoring skills and learn new skills in cutting-edge areas (machine learning and omics science) through focused study, selected coursework, seminars, and guidance from senior collaborators with domain expertise. Finally, this grant will support a research project that is based on the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, which extends Dr. Chen’s ongoing work to elucidate the role of atrial cardiomyopathy in driving AF-related outcomes. The specific aims are: (1) Identify atrial cardiomyopathy subtypes by using machine learning approaches to analyze the extensive data at ARIC Visit 5 (2011-13): clinical, 2D-echocardiographic, heart rate variability, arterial stiffness, ECG, and multi-omics data, (2) Evaluate association of subtypes with ischemic stroke and other CV outcomes, and (3) Discover specific risk factors for subtypes by analyzing risk factor measures collected at Visits 1-4 (1987-98). Crucially, findings will be validated in 2 independent community-based cohorts: Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) and Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). This project has significant impact: (1) This K24 grant will provide the PI with the protected time to enhance his current mentoring of trainees involved in POR. By assembling a team of senior collaborators that comprise experts in mentoring, data science, and molecular epidemiology, the PI provides an outstanding platform for his mentees to acquire cutting-edge skills in POR, (2) By resolving heterogeneity in atrial cardiomyopathy, the team will advance the NIH’s Precision Medicine initiative by personalizing current treatment for patients based on biological underpinnings, (3) The findings will lead to a clinically meaningful improvement in classification of stroke risk in patients with AF, which will improve patient outcomes, (4) By efficiently leveraging existing resources of deeply phenotyped NHLBI cohorts, this project will fill critical knowledge gaps in prevention and treatment, thus achieving a sustained and powerful impact on CV public health, clinical practice, and education of the next generation of researchers in POR. The abnormal atrial substrate (atrial cardiomyopathy) is associated with elevated risks of ischemic stroke dementia, and other cardiovascular outcomes, such as heart failure. Progress in preventing these adverse outcomes has been hampered by unresolved heterogeneity underlying atrial cardiomyopathy; hence, this K24 grant will support a project that will use machine learning and dense phenotypic data to identify clinically relevant subtypes of atrial cardiomyopathy. Additionally, this K24 grant will foster a supportive environment for the mentoring of junior investigators involved in patient-oriented research and facilitate acquisition of new cutting-edge skills by the PI and his mentees.",Mentoring and Research to Classify  Atrial Cardiomyopathy,10307378,K24HL155813,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anticoagulants', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Atrial Function', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Multiomic Data', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'aptamer', 'arterial stiffness', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'exome', 'genome wide association study', 'heart rate variability', 'heart rhythm', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'patient oriented research', 'phenotypic data', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'recruit', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'stroke risk', 'supportive environment', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,K24,2021,126631
"A computational approach for quantifying motor behaviors in spinocerebellar ataxias to improve early detection of motor signs and precisely estimate disease severity and disease change ABSTRACT  The spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are debilitating neurodegenerative diseases that impact a range of human behaviors including arm function, speech, and vision. Tools that can quantify motor deficits in a granular and objective manner are needed to support early recognition of clinical disease onset, more sensitively determine efficacy of a therapy, and make personalized predictions about disease progression. Such tools are needed for upcoming disease modifying clinical trials in SCAs, in order to reduce sample size and trial duration and better understand how a given therapy modifies human behaviors. Powered off of the currently available primary outcome measures for these rare ataxias, clinical trials are likely to face patient recruitment and retention challenges, especially with multiple co-occurring clinical trials. These challenges may impede or slow our ability to successfully discover therapies for our patients.  We have recently made substantial progress in capturing multimodal behavioral signals from speech, eye movement, and arm motor function using everyday technologies: a microphone, iPhone camera, and computer mouse. Our initial data indicate that these scalable technologies have strong potential to extend current clinical assessments in ataxia and that our novel machine learning approach for generating disease severity estimates performs better than the traditional regression model approach. Our algorithms are able to quantitatively identify signs of ataxia and parkinsonism in SCA individuals' speech and arm movement, even when absent on clinical assessment. Furthermore, our novel severity estimation algorithm enabled measurement of disease progression more sensitively than clinical scales. We propose to substantially expand longitudinal data collection and further develop our novel analytic approaches to train more powerful models for characterizing and quantifying human motor behavior. The technologies developed have the potential to facilitate clinical trials aimed at bringing disease modifying therapies to individuals with SCA. While the focus of this project is on SCA, the novel methodological approaches and data generated are applicable to other neurodegenerative diseases affecting movement and speech. Furthermore, this project will bring new insight into how motor abnormalities initially arise and progress.  The overall goal of this project is to develop widely available systems for improving early detection of clinical disease onset, severity assessment, and prognostication of spinocerebellar ataxias while simultaneously learning how these disorders impact fine-grained motor behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE  There are currently no disease modifying therapies for the spinocerebellar ataxias. One important barrier for development of new therapies for spinocerebellar ataxia and other neurodegenerative diseases is the lack of tools to objectively and sensitively measure a beneficial clinical response to a drug. This project aims to develop systems based on everyday technologies and sophisticated computational methods to provide accessible tools for early detection, precise severity measurement, and prediction of disease progression in spinocerebellar ataxias.",A computational approach for quantifying motor behaviors in spinocerebellar ataxias to improve early detection of motor signs and precisely estimate disease severity and disease change,10210639,R01NS117826,"['Affect', 'Age of Onset', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Ataxia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collection', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Eye Movements', 'Face', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning Disorders', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Onset of illness', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Sample Size', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Speech', 'Spinocerebellar Ataxias', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trinucleotide Repeats', 'Vision', 'arm', 'arm function', 'arm movement', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'digital', 'disease classification', 'drug development', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'illness length', 'improved', 'insight', 'member', 'microphone', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'oculomotor', 'open source', 'personalized predictions', 'point of care', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'response', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,555308
"Creating adaptive, wearable technologies to assess and intervene for individuals with ADRDs PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Advances in machine learning and low-cost, wearable sensors offer a practical method for understanding, assessing, and intervening for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRDs) in everyday spaces. We propose to create a Behaviorome research program that will create ground-breaking methods for building health-predictive models from wearable sensor data by mapping patterns of behavior using machine learning and pervasive computing technologies. This program will create innovative multidisciplinary ideas to address NIH ADRD Milestone 11.c, Embed wearable technologies/pervasive computing in existing and new clinical research. Our research program builds on a history of interdisciplinary research contributions in areas including human behavior modeling from longitudinal sensor data and design of novel assessment and intervention mechanisms. We propose to design and validate methods for mapping a human behaviorome “in the wild”, automatically assessing cognitive and functional health from behavior markers, scaling technologies through machine learning, linking health and behavior with their influences, and closing the loop with automated interventions. Similarly, our mentoring program builds on experience training students and early- career investigators to become leaders in the field of gerontechnology. We will recruit and train graduate students and early-stage researchers, including those from underrepresented groups, to grow an institutional multidisciplinary Behaviorome research program and to establish new research programs that contribute to the targeted Milestone. We will scale the impact of mentoring by establishing a webinar series and creating youtube videos that highlight and explain breakthroughs in the design and application of Behaviorome research. Results of this program will include scripts and templates to construct a behaviorome with resource- limited wearable devices, scale data and models to large diverse populations, integrate data with multiple information sources (e.g., genetics), automate health assessment and intervention, and create understandable explanations of data and models. These will contribute to existing clinical studies such as the clinician-in-the- loop smart home, digital memory notebook, and pervasive computing measures of functional performance. Furthermore, they will lead to new clinical studies that formalize connections between health and its influences, exploration of the impact of ethnicity and the built environment on health, and the design of ADRD interventions for medication adherence, task prompting, and negative interaction de-escalation. The proposed contributions are significant because they will provide insights on detecting and assessing ADRDs within a person's everyday environment using wearable sensing and pervasive computing methods that have not been investigated in prior work. Additionally, the mentoring steps will pave the way for a new generation of researchers to offer improved methods of addressing the need to understand, assess, and intervene for ADRDs in everyday settings, thereby improving quality of life and reducing health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to build a multidisciplinary research and mentoring program that will design wearable sensing and pervasive computing technologies to improve detection, assessment and intervention for individuals with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRDs). Built on a foundation of existing research and mentoring collaboration between computer science and neuropsychology, we will design and validate methods to analyze the relationship between ADRDs and behavior. We will create robust health-predictive models from longitudinal sensor data collected in naturalistic settings and will connect health and behavior with multiple influences, such as genetics and environment, to advance quality of care and reduce functional disability associated with ADRDs.","Creating adaptive, wearable technologies to assess and intervene for individuals with ADRDs",10168052,R35AG071451,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuropsychology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'built environment', 'career', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'graduate student', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medication compliance', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'recruit', 'sensor', 'smart home', 'student training', 'wearable device', 'wearable sensor technology', 'webinar']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,918000
"Application of Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Data to a Predictive Model of Neuroblastoma Project Summary There is currently no diagnostic tool to accurately predict pediatric neuroblastoma disease outcome that is based on the mechanistic nature of the disease and genomic information of a child’s tumor. Neuroblastoma is a solid, cancerous tumor of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) that accounts for half of all cancers in infants younger than 1 year. Uncertainties in the trajectory of disease progression has led to aggressive radiation and chemotherapy treatments that often result in long-term developmental disabilities for children. Determination of the critical drivers of neuroblastoma initiation and assessment of their interactions for an individual child would help target chemotherapy and limit over-treatment, possibly resulting in an increased quality of life and infant survival. Our solution to this problem is to develop a predictive artificial intelligence algorithm (PredictNeuroB) and use genomic input from a child’s tumor to test its predictive strengths to predict disease progression, identify critical disease drivers and compare results to current clinical statistical-based algorithms. PredictNeuroB is based on the network interactions of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) developmental signals and is supported by our discovery of a critical role for trkB and its ligand brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) during SNS development. Our published model’s prediction of early stage neuroblastoma (for infants 0-2yrs old) using genomic information of 77 children is more accurate than any current clinical prognostic (Kasemeier-Kulesa et al., 2018). In this study, we propose to strengthen the predictive capability of our model for a broader class of patient data (age, stage of disease, chromosome status, MYCN amplification) by applying Gabriella Miller Kids First neuroblastoma databases. Further, we will perform in silico perturbations of the algorithm to determine critical drivers capable of altering neuroblastoma outcome states. At the conclusion of our study, by using a larger set of patient-derived data with associated clinical and disease outcome information, we expect our PredictNeuroB model will prove highly predictive for a broad class of neuroblastoma patients and support clinical decision making in disease treatment and targeted drug therapies. Project Narrative Neuroblastoma accounts for half of all childhood cancers in infants younger than 1 year, yet there is no diagnostic tool to accurately predict disease progression and outcome. Our solution to this problem is to develop a predictive artificial intelligence algorithm (PredictNeuroB) that is based on the developmental signaling network from which neuroblastoma originates and test its capability to more precisely predict disease outcome using a child’s genomic information as input. By leveraging the information in Gabriella Miller Kids First databases we will test PredictNeuroB for a broader class of children than available in published academic data, resulting in a precise and personalized prognostic tool with the possibility to increase infant quality of life and survival by limiting over-treatment and targeting chemotherapy.",Application of Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Data to a Predictive Model of Neuroblastoma,10193881,R03HD105079,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Apoptosis', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Cancerous', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Developmental Gene', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'MYCN gene', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neuroblastoma', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Research', 'Predictive Value', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Speed', 'Staging System', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Testing', 'Tumor Markers', 'Uncertainty', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cell motility', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'experimental study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'intelligent algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'nervous system development', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'personalized predictions', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'receptor', 'risk variant', 'surgical risk', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor']",NICHD,STOWERS INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH,R03,2021,165000
"Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for an NIMH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) entitled ""Neural Biomarkers of ECT Response in Schizophrenia."" In this application, Dr. Miklos Argyelan proposes a comprehensive plan for transitioning into an independent translational researcher focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of treatment response in schizophrenia by integrating functional neuroimaging with neuromodulatory bioelectric treatment approaches. Despite its effectiveness and intensive research, the mechanism of action for ECT remains unknown, and currently no clinical or biological biomarkers exist to predict response. In patients with schizophrenia undergoing a trial of ECT (with bitemporal electrode placement), the proposed study will use resting-state functional MRI, as well as electrical field modeling as applied to structural MRI scans, to examine the neural circuitry underlying clinical response. Patients will undergo MRI scanning at baseline, and after the 8th ECT treatment. Results of this proposal may lead to biomarkers that will optimize treatment algorithms for schizophrenia with higher efficacy. Identifying target mechanisms would not only improve the current deployment of bioelectric approaches as part of a “precision medicine” approach, but could also lead to the development of novel therapies. This line of research will be conducted under the guidance of mentors who are recognized experts in the biomarker research of schizophrenia (Anil K. Malhotra, M.D.), neuromodulation (Georgios Petrides, M.D., Marom Bikson Ph.D.), neuroimaging of ECT (Chris Abbott, M.D.) and analyzing high dimensional datasets (Jing Sui, PhD.). Concurrently, Dr Argyelan will engage in a comprehensive training program which is fully integrated with the research study in the proposal. The training plan contains three domains with corresponding goals: (1) to gain further expertise in designing and conducting clinical trials in schizophrenia, (2) to expand my knowledge in machine learning algorithms, and (3) to learn more about electrical field (EF) modeling techniques. The combination of training in clinical trials, machine learning and neuromodulation will support the planned research to provide the framework to explore and validate biomarkers of disease and treatment response. The culmination of these training activities, combined with the planned research aims under this award, will prepare Dr. Argyelan to develop into an independent translational researcher and to submit a planned R01 in personalized neuromodulation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has been consistently shown to be an effective augmentation strategy in the treatment of schizophrenia, however its mechanism of action remains unknown, and there are no clinical or biological predictors to predict response. The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to examine the functional neural circuitry that underlies successful treatment with ECT, which may lead to the identification of biomarkers that will allow for more efficient use of ECT, as well as additional treatment targets for patients with refractory illness.

"Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images African American and Latinx communities nationally and in California not only bear a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 positive cases and deaths but are also not taking part in COVID-19 testing for a wide range of understudied reasons. This can have profound implications in safety net health care settings where vulnerable patients, who are in need of clinical procedures to prevent significant morbidity, are refusing such potentially lifesaving procedures because of fear of COVID-19 testing and/or contracting COVID-19. The Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) is the second largest publicly operated county safety net health care system in the United States, serving more than 750,000 patients annually. Timely access to health care in this under-resourced, high-need setting has been an ongoing challenge for its majority Latinx and African American patients. With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why patients refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. To this end, we propose to explore the obstacles to COVID-19 pre- procedural testing and provide COVID-19 specific training to LACDHS Community Health Workers (CHWs) from these same communities to effectively address: a) the primary goal of increasing COVID-19 testing for individual patients, and the secondary goals of b) facilitating needed procedural care in a timely manner for the safety net health system, and c) developing a sustained public health presence in these communities to build trust and preparedness for critical COVID-19 related future needs. Trained CHWs can help to more effectively overcome obstacles to COVID-19 testing, including historical barriers of mistrust, provide COVID-19 health education, help address social determinants of health and help facilitate technological literacy to improve patient access to testing and care in a telehealth environment. The proposal uses a multidisciplinary, mixed- methods approach including unsupervised machine learning and qualitative interviews to systematically explore barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 testing among vulnerable safety net patients. We will then train clinically based, ethnically/linguistically matched CHWs to implement a hypothesis-driven intervention consisting of six group classes and six personalized patient encounters with African American and Latinx safety net patients. This study has the following specific aims: Aim 1- Utilize machine learning methods to assess whether there are characteristics that define African American and Latinx safety-net patients who engage in or refuse COVID-19 testing; Aim 2 - Conduct in-depth interviews with African American and Latinx patients who either declined or accepted COVID testing to explore contextual, behavioral, and attitudinal factors shaping patient circumstances and concerns; Aim 3 - Develop, implement, and pre-test a CHW intervention with the information from Aims 1 and 2, utilizing a randomized control design among African American and Latinx safety net patients to assess the effect of the CHW hypothesis-driven intervention on trust, self-efficacy, and intent to participate in COVID-19 testing. Project Narrative With the current pandemic, COVID-19 testing for patients has become an essential first step in the provision of critical procedural care. However, the range of reasons why vulnerable patients in safety net health care settings refuse COVID-19 testing is little understood. This grant is an innovative proposal that seeks to (1) bring together machine learning and behavioral methods to understand the reasons why Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LACDHS) safety net patients who require COVID-19 testing for procedures refuse or accept COVID-19 testing, and (2) utilize the knowledge gleaned to implement a Community Health Worker (CHW)-based intervention, using LACDHS CHWs, that addresses the multilevel obstacles to COVID- 19 testing. Insights gained from this research may be of benefit to improve COVID-19 uptake in other similar safety net settings with CHWs and in planning the future uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in such medically underserved settings.",Predicting Diabetic Retinopathy from Risk Factor Data and Digital Retinal Images,10258973,R01LM012309,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Behavioral', 'COVID testing', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 testing', 'COVID-19 vaccine', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Community Health Aides', 'Community Health Services', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health education', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Housing', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Intention', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Linguistics', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'PhenX Toolkit', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Religion', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Science', 'Self Efficacy', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transportation', 'Trust', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vaccines', 'Weighing patient', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'digital', 'economic need', 'health care availability', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'literacy', 'machine learning method', 'medically underserved', 'multidisciplinary', 'outreach', 'pandemic disease', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'retinal imaging', 'safety net', 'skills', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'telehealth', 'testing access', 'testing uptake', 'unsupervised learning', 'uptake', 'vaccine acceptance', 'virtual intervention', 'virtual patient']",NLM,CHARLES R.

"Biomedical Raman Imaging Workshop Summary The purpose of the planned conference is to facilitate development of Raman-spectroscopy based clinical appli- cations.  Raman scattering provides label-free contrast for imaging that derives from intrinsic molecular vibrations. Because it is label-free and reports in an unbiased way on all molecular species in a sample, it provides a holistic “view” of the chemical environment in clinical samples, and thus holds signiﬁcant value as a diagnostic and treatment monitoring tool.  While the phenomenon of Raman scattering has been known since 1920, and its clinical potential has been recognized for many decades, roadblocks including weak signal levels and complexity of its readout has precluded it from clinical use. These roadblocks are now being removed through innovations in instrument development and machine learning. Narrative Raman spectroscopy provides diagnostically important chemical proﬁles of clinical samples, withouth the need of labeling. Throgh this it holds tremendous potential to improve many diagnostic and monitoring aspects of healthcare. The purpose of this workshop is to facilitate efﬁcient development of these techniques in a way that will be clinically acceptable.",Biomedical Raman Imaging Workshop,10318774,R13EB032251,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Antibiotic susceptibility', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Fingerprint', 'Fruit', 'Generations', 'Healthcare', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'In Situ', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Paper', 'Pathogen detection', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Publishing', 'Raman Spectrum Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Voice', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'contrast imaging', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'liquid biopsy', 'screening', 'symposium', 'technique development', 'technology development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'vibration']",NIBIB,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R13,2021,9996
"Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages PROJECT ABSTRACT Health insurance has been at the forefront of US public policy debate throughout the last decade. For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965. Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be a controversial definition. Some decisions about what Medicare should cover have engendered intense debate, underscoring the importance of the program’s coverage decisions for millions of patients and doctors. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. Yet, despite the importance of decisions about the scope of insurance coverage in and outside of Medicare, we know little about how the scope of coverage (as opposed to patient cost-sharing), affects treatment choices, clinical practice, and health outcomes for the elderly. The research outlined in this proposal aims to start filling this gap. The project investigates how the presence or lack of insurance coverage for specific procedural or pharmacologic therapies affects treatment decisions and health outcomes for the elderly with Alzheimer’s Disease and related Dementias (ADRD). This is a population that may be particularly vulnerable to changes and limits in insurance coverage, as the patients may have limited decision-making capacity and may be disproportionately exposed to treatments that are deemed experimental and lacking effectiveness to clear the “reasonable and necessary” threshold. Aim 1 of the project is to estimate the average effect of coverage decisions across prescription drugs and outpatient procedures on treatment decisions and health outcomes of elderly Medicare enrollees with ADRD. Aim 2 is to predict and characterize the subgroups of ADRD patients that are most likely to be affected by decisions that restrict the scope of insurance coverage using machine learning methods. The proposed empirical method is to use quasi- experimental variation that arises from natural experiments of abrupt changes in insurance coverage within different parts of the Medicare program. The analysis takes advantage of variation in the scope of formularies across Medicare Part D plans, as well as the variation in local coverage decisions for physician services and outpatient procedures under Medicare Part B. These sources of variation coupled with methods for quasi- experimental estimation of treatment effects and machine learning methods for heterogeneity analyses, allow estimating the response of treatment decisions and health of the elderly with ADRD across different drugs, procedures, and subgroups of ADRD patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE For elderly Americans, who benefit from nearly universal coverage under Medicare, decisions about the scope of their insurance coverage have been a central policy concern since Medicare’s inception in 1965 - Medicare’s coverage is extensive, but nevertheless incomplete as by statute the program only covers medical services that are “reasonable and necessary,” which can be hard to define. The debate around the scope of Medicare coverage is likely to intensify in the coming decades as options for medical treatment, and testing, expand rapidly, the population ages, and public insurance systems grapple with how to address inequality in access to medical innovations. In this project I investigate how changes in coverage for prescription drugs, physician office visits, and outpatient procedures affect the treatment received by elderly patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and related dementias (ADRD), who often face coverage limitations due to experimental nature of many ADRD treatments, and yet may be most vulnerable to unintended consequences of any coverage restrictions.",Public Insurance Design and Health at Older Ages,10137860,K01AG059843,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Anxiety', 'Barbiturates', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Cost Sharing', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug Targeting', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family Physicians', 'Formularies', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Geriatrics', 'Gerontology', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Insurance', 'Heart', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Insurance', 'Insurance Coverage', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning Skill', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicare Part B', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Natural experiment', 'Nature', 'Office Visits', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outpatients', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Public Policy', 'Quasi-experiment', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Services', 'Skilled Nursing Facilities', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic procedure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universal Coverage', 'Variant', 'aging population', 'alternative treatment', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'comorbidity', 'decision-making capacity', 'design', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health insurance', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,126700
"The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major arrhythmia worldwide, causing palpitations, stroke and mortality, and affecting 2-5 million Americans. Unfortunately, therapy to eliminate AF has had limited success. In our last funding cycle, we focused on localized drivers as potential AF mechanisms. Mapping of drivers has now been validated by concurrent optical mapping of human AF, and their features and have been validated by several other methods in patients. Nevertheless, ablation results for these and other proposed mechanisms for AF outside the pulmonary veins are mixed. It is unclear if this reflects difficulties of AF mapping, or different mechanisms between patients.  The project will develop a novel mechanistic framework for AF that simplifies existing indices by building on scientific consensus that organized AF is easier to treat, and disorganized AF has worse prognosis. This concept spans many existing indices and may help to reconcile them. We have 3 specific aims: (1) To define if the impact of ablation depends on the extent of organizing surrounding the ablation site; (2) To establish candidate mechanisms for organized and disorganized AF zones in individual patients with specific profiles, using machine learning applied to known cases with and without ablation success in our large registry. This comprises detailed AF maps during ablation and after Maze surgery, clinical data and outcomes. (3) To use novel clinical tools to predict whether patients will respond to PVI, other ablation or Maze surgery based on whether targeted regions control larger atrial areas and their locations.  This study will deliver immediate translational and clinical impact, and directly enable personalized medicine for AF ablation. We use detailed clinical mapping in patients, signal processing and computer modeling to develop a novel mechanistic framework and widely applicable clinical tools. We will use tools including machine learning and statistics to classify mechanisms based upon outcomes from ablation in individual patients. We will make our data and code available online. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, machine learning, biological physics and statistics. The proposal is thus highly feasible. The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem in the United States, affecting 2-5 million Americans and causing rapid heart beats, stroke, heart failure or death. In this project, the applicant will develop a novel framework to better understand human AF that builds on agreement between several concepts for the disease.

"Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention Abstract Pressure ulcers or decubitus ulcers, more commonly known as bedsores are a huge problem affecting 2.5 million patients every year in the US and causes 60,000 deaths every year. Pressures exceeding 32 mm of Hg in the bony prominences in the back of the patient body lead to bedsores. Despite the existing low air loss mattresses, alternating pressure mattresses and the state-of-the-art air fluidized beds, bedsores prevail, and its prevention remains a huge healthcare challenge. Current hospital protocol is to turn patient every two hours. This is very disturbing and cause of pain to a resting patient who is dealing with other co-existing health conditions besides bedsores. Caregivers and nurses must turn heavy patients around, which sometimes lead to hurting their backs in the process. When not performed adequately and frequently (every 2 hours) as required, it is considered as negligence of care and causes litigation against nursing homes and hospitals causing huge financial losses to them. We propose a compliant-mechanism- based mattress that will obsolete the current clinical protocol of nurses and caregivers having to turn the patient every two hours. It will operate with minimal power, make small clicking noise when changing from one stable state to another using amount of force required to open a desk drawer. This switching of states can be further automated and can include a simple counter for documented evidence of alternating pressure to support against litigation of negligent care. In specific aim 1, machine learning using trained neural network will determine the functional requirements of the mattress (e.g., optimal amplitude and pitch for the undulation of the pressure points) by conducting a cohort pressure profile study that involves a bed that intentionally applies pressure on resting bodies. In specific aim 2, ideal topology with pitch and amplitude of undulations discovered in aim 1 will be developed using FACT and optimized using BLOT to create a prototype bi-stable compliant-mechanism-based mattress as a new approach for shifting pressure points on a patient’s body. FACT is advanced technique using freedom and constraint topologies for topology synthesis of the mattress and BLOT provides boundary layer optimization of the topology. Proposed mattress is innovative, disruptive, affordable, lightweight, does not use noisy air pumps, has no leakage issues and will eliminate the scourge of bedsores in the existing immobile and aging population. Project Narrative Numerous currently marketed alternating pressure mattresses have not received recommendations from reviewers due to poor correlation and unconvincing outcomes for bedsore prevention. Our approach of using neural network based machine learning will bring a new methodical approach to discerning the pitch and amplitude of undulations required to prevent dead pressure zones that exceed safe pressure of 32 mm of Hg on the patient’s back, which is fundamental to preventing bedsores. This will further serve as input to designing the prototype compliant-mechanism-based mattress using the freedom and constraint topologies (FACT) approach and the boundary learning optimization tool (BLOT) with end effect of developing an innovative mattress for preventing bedsores in the immobile and aging population.",Multi-stable Compliant-Mechanism-based Mattress for Bedsore Prevention,10138288,R41NR019721,"['Affect', 'Air', 'Air Pressure', 'Back', 'Beds', 'Body Weight', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Extravasation', 'Fatigue', 'Freedom', 'Geometry', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Height', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injections', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Liquid substance', 'Litigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Mattresses', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molds', 'Monitor', 'Negligence', 'Network-based', 'Noise', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Protocols', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pump', 'Recommendation', 'Rest', 'Scourge', 'Shoulder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Width', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'tool']",NINR,K MEDICAL LLC,R41,2021,251440
"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD.

"Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT Project Summary  In some individuals chronic tobacco smoke exposure results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. Both of these parenchymal changes are irreversible, highlighting the importance of the early identification of their development and progression. Unfortunately, currently available methods for detecting the presence and evolution of these changes have limited sensitivity and specificity for very early disease and for subtle disease progression. Dr. Ash’s work has shown that automated objective analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest can detect clinically relevant radiologic findings called interstitial changes that may represent early pulmonary fibrosis, even in individuals without visually apparent disease. In the first aim of this proposal, Dr. Ash will refine and utilize a more sensitive and specific automated CT analysis tool that he and his lab have developed for the detection of both emphysema and interstitial changes. He will determine if emphysema and interstitial changes detected using this method are clinically significant in those patients deemed normal by previously performed visual analysis and in those deemed normal by other objective approaches. In the second aim, he will determine if areas of locally high density tissue in visually normal appearing lung parenchyma measured using augmented versions of his objective analysis tools are associated with mortality, other clinical outcomes, and peripheral measures of inflammation. Finally, in the third aim he will utilize these techniques to analyze longitudinal CT scans from the COPDGene study that were obtained over 10 years of follow-up, and will identify factors that predict or modify the development and progression of parenchymal changes on CT.  Dr. Ash will perform this work in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), a core teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, under the mentorship of Dr. George Washko, an expert in the field of medical image analysis and the co-principal investigator of the Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory at BWH. With the guidance of Dr. Washko and his scientific advisory committee, Dr. Ash has developed a comprehensive five year training program to develop the skills needed to become an independent investigator with expertise in quantitative image analysis, including predictive modeling and statistical machine learning.  Dr. Ash is dedicated to a career in academic medicine. His goal is to become a clinician-scientist using the skills gained during this award to improve our ability to detect and monitor smoking related lung disease. The techniques he has proposed may help identify modifiable risk factors and treatments for smoking related lung disease, determine which patients are likely to benefit from treatment, and monitor the response to therapy. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, but only in a minority of smokers. This proposal aims to use advanced objective analysis of chest computed tomography images to detect the earliest manifestations of smoking related lung disease. This will enable us to identify susceptible patients at the earliest possible moment, track their disease progression, and ultimately shift treatment strategies from palliating disease related symptoms to preventing disease development.",Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT,10079021,K08HL145118,"['Advisory Committees', 'Area', 'Award', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Densitometry', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Evolution', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predictive Factor', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Symptoms', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chest computed tomography', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'exercise capacity', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interstitial', 'lung injury', 'mange', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'palliate', 'palliating symptoms', 'palliation', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'protein biomarkers', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoking-related lung disease', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2021,170320
"Using Multi-Spectral Imaging with Microchip Electrophoresis to Accurately Screen Newborns for Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Hemoglobin (Hb) disorders are among the world's most common monogenic diseases. Nearly 7% of the world’s population carry Hb gene variants. Sickle cell disease (SCD) arises when Hb mutations are inherited homozygously (HbSS) or paired with another β-globin gene mutation. Globally, an estimated 400,000 babies are born annually with SCD, and 70%-75% are in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It is estimated that 50-90% in SSA die by their 5th birthday, 70% of these deaths are preventable. Effective management of SCD involves early diagnosis, and genetic counselling, and, importantly, nationwide newborn screening (NBS). NBS programs utilizing centralized laboratories have dramatically reduced SCD mortality in high-resource countries. NBS requires sensitive detection of relatively low levels of Hb variants in the presence of high fetal Hb (HbF). Normal HbA and sickle HbS should be accurately identified in the presence of high levels (up to 90%) of HbF. The current gold standard for Hb variant testing is high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which requires expensive equipment and reagents, highly trained personnel, and modern laboratories. In low- resource regions, very few centralized laboratories can perform costly Hb testing. Testing is not available to the large percentage of infants born outside of a major hospital or city. There is an unmet need for affordable, portable, easy-to-use, accurate, point-of-care (POC) tests to facilitate decentralized Hb testing to enable nationwide NBS programs. In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed Hb electrophoresis as an essential in vitro diagnostic in low- and middle-income countries. We have developed a POC microchip electrophoresis Hb variant testing system, MicroChip Electrophoresis (MCE), under the product name “Gazelle Hb Variant” by Hemex Health, Inc. MCE reports Hb phenotype, Hb quantification (%Hb), and an interpretive statement showing genotype (such as SCD, Sickle Cell Trait, or Normal). MCE has been extensively validated for hemoglobinopathies, including SCD, hemoglobin E disease, and thalassemia. Newborns and infants below 6 weeks of age have very low concentrations of Hb variants other than Hb F which is high, therefore an improvement to lower the limit of detection (LoD) is needed to support NBS programs worldwide. By decreasing the LoD from the current 10% to 2%, newborns and infants can be screened with this affordable system. The innovation in this SBIR Phase I is the integration of multi-spectral imaging and machine learning based data analysis capability to MCE to develop MCE+ to accurately screen newborns for common Hb variants. We propose the following aims: Aim 1: Integrate multi-spectral imaging and machine learning algorithm into the MCE platform to enable identification and quantification of hemoglobin variants in newborns. Aim 2: Perform clinical testing of the MCE+ multi-spectral newborn screening system. Significance of this project is that MCE+ is the only affordable POC system for quantitative and objective hemoglobin variant testing that allows screening at birth. PROJECT NARRATIVE Up to 50 to 90% of children born with sickle cell disease (SCD) in economically disadvantaged countries (over 400,000 per year) die before the age of five, although the WHO estimates that 70% could be saved through simple, cost-effective treatments. Early diagnosis starting at birth is critical for implementing effective disease management, but newborn screening is a challenge for low resource environments where a decentralized, point-of-care solution is needed. This project enables our affordable, point-of-care platform based on microchip electrophoresis technology to accurately perform newborn screening.",Using Multi-Spectral Imaging with Microchip Electrophoresis to Accurately Screen Newborns for Sickle Cell Disease,10255480,R43HL156685,"['Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Age', 'Bedside Testings', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Care Technology Points', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Country', 'Data Analyses', 'Decentralization', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Electrophoresis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Fetal Hemoglobin', 'Gender', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic Counseling', 'Genotype', 'Ghana', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hemoglobin E Disease', 'Hemoglobin concentration result', 'Hemoglobinopathies', 'High Pressure Liquid Chromatography', 'Hospitals', 'Human Resources', 'India', 'Infant', 'Inherited', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Microchip Electrophoresis', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Names', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Newborn Infant', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Point-of-Care Systems', 'Population', 'Race', 'Reagent', 'Reference Standards', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Sickle Cell Anemia', 'Sickle Cell Trait', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Southeastern Asia', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thalassemia', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'beta Globin', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective treatment', 'detection limit', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'in-vitro diagnostics', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'low and middle-income countries', 'machine learning algorithm', 'miniaturize', 'mortality', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'preventable death', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'screening program', 'sickling', 'spectrograph', 'trait']",NHLBI,"HEMEX HEALTH, INC.",R43,2021,256580
"Early Mobilization: Operationalizing Big Data & Implementation Science to Lead Expansion to ICUs (E-MOBILE-ICU) PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 800,000 critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation every year and three quarters of the survivors suffer from persistent disability, which poses a major public health problem as critical care becomes more widely utilized and available. Although early mobilization, which engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation, is a promising evidence-based intervention that may prevent disability, less than ten percent of pa- tients ever get out of bed. This proposal aims to apply precision medicine to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early mobilization and elucidate how it can be implemented successfully to extend the benefits of early mobilization to critical care survivors at greatest risk for long-term disability. I hypothesize that this re- source-intensive intervention can be applied with greater precision to a subset of patients most likely to bene- fit, and that implementation science strategies can be devised to successfully drive adoption of this interven- tion beyond a clinical trial setting. I will test my hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) I will identify the optimal critical illness phenotype for implementation of early mobilization by using cutting-edge machine learning methods; Aim 2) I will determine the effect of early mobilization on long-term functional disability to incentivize adoption of this practice; Aim 3) I will determine the barriers and facilitators of implementation of early mobilization across five institutions to identify the contextual features associated with successful implementation to inform strategies that can bridge the gap between evidence base and clinical practice. My long-term goal is to mitigate the com- plications of critical illness with clinical trials using precision-based methods to identify at-risk and yet apt-to- benefit populations paired with implementation science methodologies to illuminate how to bring these interven- tions to the bedside. To accomplish this, I have assembled an exceptional interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. Vineet Arora, Matthew Churpek, and John Kress) and advisors (Drs. Shyam Prabhakaran, Donald Hedeker, Laura Damschroder, and Matthias Eikermann) who have a track record of NIH-funding and successful mentor- ship of post-doctoral candidates. I intend to build on my foundation as an accomplished clinical trialist and have formulated an in-depth career development plan to gain expertise in machine learning methods to identify differ- ential treatment effects (Churpek and Prabhakaran), longitudinal data analysis, (Arora and Hedeker), and imple- mentation science methods (Arora, Prabhakaran, and Damschroder) to craft strategies that bring complex mul- tidisciplinary interventions from clinical trials (Kress and Eikermann) to everyday ICU care. Completion of this proposal will train me to fill an unmet need defined by a recent National Academy of Medicine publication which indicated that identification of differential treatment effects must be paired with rigorous implementation to help transition evidence base to routine clinical care. Equipped with advanced statistical skills and implementation science approaches, I will be able to design hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to target and implement complex multidisciplinary interventions to vulnerable populations in future R01 level applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Three-quarters of survivors of mechanical ventilation will develop persistent disability. Early mobilization engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation to prevent disability, but has poor adoption into clinical practice.

"PROTECT: optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and Route to achieve and maintain BP Target Need. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension (HTN) have their blood pressure (BP) uncontrolled. BP above clinical Target even for a few months increases the risk for stroke (35-40%), heart failure (HF) (up to 64%), myocardial infarction (MI) (15-25%). Physician-nurse-pharmacist resource-intensive demonstrations in achieving & maintaining BP Target have shown promising results, but their real-life deployment was found unsustainable long-term. As a result, a process-standardized and sustainable solution is acutely needed.  Solution. In response to this need, Optima Integrated Health developed optima4BP 1.0. It is a first-in-class artificial intelligence (AI) that simulates the process of clinical reasoning undertaken by the treating physician in optimizing the anti-HTN treatment towards BP Target. Just like the physician, optima4BP 1.0 cannot determine upfront the needed Optimal Treatment (OT) to achieve & maintain BP Target for 1-2 years. PROTECT [optima4BP 2.0: prediction of Optimal Treatment and route to achieve and maintain BP Target] proposes to establish upfront the personalized OT. The OT can then be used to select the shortest and safest treatment modification route needed to achieve & maintain BP Target. Phase II Goal. Build optima4BP 2.0.  Phase I. Phase I Prior Work demonstrated that k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), an AI model, can predict with ≥ 80% confidence the correct anti-HTN treatment, when compared to physician decision.  Phase II. optima4BP 2.0 will predict the Optimal Treatment and route to achieve & maintain BP Target.  Optimal Treatment data-mining source. PROTECT will use the SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial, 2015) and ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes, 2010) clinical trial data. They represent the foundation of the most current anti-HTN treatment management national guidelines.  Aim 1. Build kNN. Hypothesis. kNN can predict the proximity (clinical relevance) of a patient to an Optimal Treatment (OT). Milestone. Achieve ≥ 90% accuracy of prediction to physician decision. Phase I Data Preparation protocol will be applied to the SPRINT & ACCORD data. Then, the kNN Ensemble Learning function will be built to select the Optimal Treatment with the highest demonstrated efficacy by comparing the choice from 3 computational approaches developed and tested during Phase I.  Aim 2. Build the Optimal Treatment Route (OTR). Hypothesis. Knowing the Current and Optimal Treatment (OT), an OTR can be built. Milestone. Safest Route: Achieve 100% exclusion of treatments that led to an adverse event in similar patient populations. Shortest Route: Achieve ≥30% reduction in number of treatment changes compared to physician route. The OTR will be built by comparing at each Step on the Route how similar each Candidate Treatment is to the OT through a computed similarity assessment.  optima4BP 2.0 aims to establish a process-standardized & sustainable solution with the goal of reducing the incidence of stroke, HF, MI and death resulting from uncontrolled hypertension. In the US, 40 million patients with hypertension have their blood pressure uncontrolled. We propose to build and test optima4BP 2.0 (Project Name: PROTECT) that will predict upfront the personalized optimal treatment and shortest treatment route required by a patient to achieve and maintain blood pressure target.

"Preventing medication dispensing errors in pharmacy practice with interpretable machine intelligence PROJECT SUMMARY Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States behind cancer and cardiovascular disease. The largest proportion of medical errors involve medications. Medication errors result in 3 million outpatient medical appointments, 1 million emergency department visits, and 125,000 hospital admissions each year. Astoundingly, over 4 billion prescriptions are dispensed every year in the United States alone. Although dispensing error rates are generally low at 0.06%, the sheer volume of dispensed medications translates to 2.4 million incorrectly dispensed medications each year. In the pharmacy, dispensing errors arise when pharmacists do not detect that the medication filled inside a prescription vial is different from the medication ordered on the prescription's label. These dispensing errors can result in patient harm, added strain on the healthcare system, and costly legal action against the pharmacy. Machine intelligence (MI) can be employed to assist in the verification process to help avoid dangerous and costly pharmacy dispensing errors.4–6 However for the human-MI partnership to function optimally, the MI should be capable of conveying accurate information that encourages providers to make sound cognitive decisions such that optimal trust is maintained, and temporal and cognitive demand is reduced. Imperative to this goal is to design MI from which interpretable information can be extracted, convey this information in an effective manner and calibrate user's trust in MI as either over-trust or under-trust can lead to near miss and incident errors. This proposed project will further our knowledge for designing interpretable MI outputs and inform the development of MI models that encourage pharmacy staff to make sound clinical decisions that lead to better patient outcomes while improving work-life at lower costs of care. This study develops interpretable MI methods in the context of medication images classification and designs effective MI advice and reasoning that lead to lower cognitive demand and increased trust in the MI. Our hypothesis is that interpretable MI will lead to improved work performance and more calibrated trust compared to uninterpretable M. The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) design interpretable machine intelligence to double-check dispensed medication images in real-time; 2) evaluate changes in pharmacy staff trust due to the long-term use of interpretable machine intelligence; and 3) determine the effect of interpretable machine intelligence on long-term pharmacy staff work performance. PROJECT NARRATIVE Medical errors are the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States behind cancer and cardiovascular disease and the largest proportion of medical errors involve medications. These dispensing errors occur approximately 2,400,000 times every year in the United States alone and can result in patient safety issues and add unnecessarily to the already strained healthcare system.The objectives of this proposal are to: 1) design interpretable machine intelligence to double-check dispensed medication images in real-time; 2) evaluate changes in pharmacy staff trust due to the long-term use of interpretable machine intelligence; and 3) determine the effect of interpretable machine intelligence on long-term pharmacy staff work performance.",Preventing medication dispensing errors in pharmacy practice with interpretable machine intelligence,10183536,R01LM013624,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical Errors', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance at work', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Stream', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Vial device', 'Work', 'base', 'care costs', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'medical appointment', 'patient safety', 'prevent', 'sound', 'support tools', 'tool', 'visual tracking']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,288814
"Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis PROJECT SUMMARY This overall goal of this mentored patient-oriented research career development award is to improve our understanding of pouchitis and other inflammatory conditions after restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA). Dr. Barnes is a motivated clinical researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC), with a specific interest in the study of inflammatory bowel diseases. Over the next five years, Dr. Barnes will work with his mentorship committee to continue his progression towards his goal of independence. His mentorship committee includes experts in gastrointestinal epidemiology and comparative effectiveness (Kappelman), patient reported outcomes [(PROs) DeWalt], and precision medicine (Kosorok). Each member has an established track record of mentoring junior faculty, consistent peer-reviewed support, and high research productivity. Dr. Barnes’s career development objectives are as follows: 1) develop a new skillset in comparative effectiveness research using real-world data; 2) obtain knowledge and experience in the development of PRO assessments; 3) acquire new skills in machine learning and precision medicine principles which will allow for the incorporation of clinical and microbiota data into new risk modeling for patients undergoing restorative proctocolectomy with IPAA, and 4) transition to independence. To achieve his career development objectives, Dr. Barnes will participate in structured coursework, conduct mentored research, and will participate in workshops through the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, including the R-Writing Group. The research and training environment at UNC is well established. For fiscal year 2019, UNC ranked tenth among both private and public universities nationwide for National Institutes of Health (NIH) research funding to domestic institutions of higher education. The specific aims of this research project are 1) to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of specific biologic therapies for the treatment of chronic inflammatory conditions of the pouch after IPAA; 2) to develop PRO items for evaluating quality of life and specific symptom domains among patients after IPAA. Techniques for PRO development will include identifying symptom domains relevant to patients after IPAA using qualitative research methods, selecting candidate items for IPAA-specific PROs using existing PRO instruments where appropriate, and performing cognitive interviews with patients after IPAA to ensure content validity; and 3) to demonstrate novel methods for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis using a machine learning approach. Expanding an existing prospective cohort, Dr. Barnes will utilize the stool microbiome, laboratory data and clinical variables to create signatures for identifying predictors of chronic pouchitis. The combination of mentorship, didactics, and research experiences offered through this K23 proposal will allow Dr. Barnes to develop a unique skillset that will aid in his ultimate transition to independence as a clinical investigator and research scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although restorative proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis (IPAA) is the most common surgery for refractory ulcerative colitis and ulcerative colitis-related dysplasia, multiple complications can occur. Short and long-term complications include inflammatory conditions of the pouch such as acute and chronic pouchitis and Crohn’s-like disease of the pouch, each of which can require new medical treatments after surgery and can significantly impact the quality of life of individual patients. This mentored patient-oriented research career development project will generate evidence about the comparative effectiveness of therapies for the treatment of these inflammatory conditions of the pouch, will develop new IPAA-specific patient-reported assessments of pouch symptoms and quality of life, and will utilize precision medicine techniques including machine learning to identify patients at high-risk for developing chronic pouchitis.",Treatment Approaches and Outcomes in Pouch-related Disorders after Colectomy for Ulcerative Colitis,10103883,K23DK127157,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colectomy', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Counseling', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Crowding', 'Curative Surgery', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dysplasia', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Ileal Reservoirs', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'North Carolina', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pouchitis', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevention strategy', 'Privatization', 'Productivity', 'Prospective cohort', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Refractory', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Restorative Proctocolectomy', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cognitive interview', 'comparative effectiveness', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'effectiveness study', 'experience', 'fecal microbiome', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk', 'higher education', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'instrument', 'interest', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'microbiota', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented research', 'precision medicine', 'predictive signature', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K23,2021,200052
"Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family Caregivers ABSTRACT Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Dementias (PwADRD). Fall costs are expected to reach $67.7 billion this year and add to family caregiver (CG) burden. Injurious falls are a frequent reason people are unable to remain at home, resulting in significantly increased care costs to the family and society.  Most FP efforts fail to address understanding fall risks or changing behavior. In response to NIA requests for ‘Care technology to sustain in-home living, preserve function and promote effective communication’, an innovative falls prevention intervention for use by CGs of PwADRD living at home who are classified as at moderate to high fall risk for falls will be developed and tested. Goal: Develop FallScape for Dementia (FS-D), an innovative CG-provided daily treatment utilizing proprietary multimedia and behavioral intervention methods to facilitate communication and encourage FP behaviors that will reduce PwADRD falls.  The rigorous Phase 1 research plan will: a) develop a FS-D prototype that includes CG training software, multimedia and support tools to customize, conduct and review progress in daily CG-provided Mm sessions; b) Perform pilot testing and c) conduct a mixed methods preliminary clinical trial. Specific Aims and milestones/deliverables are: a) Develop prototype; i. Produce multimedia assets; ii. Craft Customization; iii. Artificial Intelligence algorithms; iv. Create CG training/daily administration tools. b) Pilot test prototype. i. Recruit 12 Dyads representing PwD diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, vascular, Lewy- body and Parkinson’s disease dementias. ii. Test CG ease of use and acceptability; iii. Examine customization for CG and dementia sub-types; iv. Evaluate relevance and dyad engagement. c) Conduct Preliminary Clinical Trial. 1. Recruit and enroll 25 Dyads; 2. Provide study components: initial; one-month FS-D intervention and a Follow-up; 3. Follow Dyads for 6 months; 4. Analyze outcomes and disseminate results.  FS-D will offer a rare opportunity to empower both CG and PwADRD by breaking the frustrating cycle of failure to recognize fall threats or change behavior and may mitigate CG burden. FS-D is an urgently needed falls prevention intervention for family CG use. The economic and quality of life benefits of sustaining in-home living for PwADRD by preventing falls will accrue to all stakeholders for this large, high-risk population. Falls are a common and expensive problem, especially in persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related Dementias (PwADRD) and the family caregiver (CG) is uniquely positioned to provide a positive daily interaction with the PwADRD in order to improve recognition of personal fall risks, encourage falls prevention behaviors and reduce falls. The proposed product FallScape- Dementia will develop and test a system for daily CG use in which Artificial Intelligence algorithms will guide the CG and customize the daily sessions. Reduction of falls will help the PwADRD to remain at home, reducing family and public health costs.",Prototype Multimedia ADRD Falls Prevention System for Family Caregivers,10260652,R43AG071360,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Balance training', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Blood Vessels', 'California', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clip', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Expenditure', 'Failure', 'Fall prevention', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Family health status', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informed Consent', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lewy Bodies', 'Long-Term Care', 'Los Angeles', 'Methods', 'Multimedia', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinson&apos', 's Dementia', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Self Administration', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Washington', 'behavior change', 'care costs', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'fall injury', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'formative assessment', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'meetings', 'member', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'novel', 'preservation', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'response', 'strength training', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIA,BROOKSIDE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT COMPANY,R43,2021,246663
"SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home We propose to develop a novel, distributed sensor platform that continuously assesses movement in the background of one's life with the goal of helping people age in place and avoid expensive and lengthy hospitalizations. On the one hand, the platform will combine measurements from a heterogeneous and  complementary set of inertial, physiological , and vision sensors with state-of-the-art techniques from robotics and machine learning, together with clinically informed dynamic models of human motion. On the other hand, the platform will use these data to target the prompt detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty, with the goal of facilitating personalized caregiver alerts if a decline in functional status is detected. Moreover, the platform will provide context-aware control inputs to facilitate unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies in the home. This project has three main thrusts: assessment, control, and home intervention. In the assessment component, our work will extend well-proven techniques of multi-modal sensor fusion for mapping and localization of robots to home-based movement monitoring and intervention. The novelty of this work lies in the tight integration of machine learning modules for real-time activity recognition and movement dysfunction diagnosis. In the control component, our work will push the boundaries of what is possible with current powered assistive devices by developing novel control mechanisms that take advantage of the new capabilities provided by the estimation component (e.g., adapting control to changes in activities and environmental contexts). In the home intervention component, we will collect data that will refine the sensing and control algorithms and involve caregivers in alerts. A patient-in-the-loop development approach will be utilized where domain-informed protocols will generate the data necessary to train and evaluate our system, both in the clinic and in the home. By enabling timely detection of movement dysfunction and facilitating unconstrained use of powered assistive technologies, this foundational technology has paradigm-disrupting potential to prevent the onset of frailty and alter the treatment options for frail individuals. In parallel, the estimation component of the system could be used in clinical settings to automate and standardize time-intensive and highly subjective functional movement assessments, allowing more accurate diagnoses while freeing clinicians for other important tasks. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Frail older adults constitute the sickest, most expensive, and fastest growing segment of the US population. Home-based technologies that facilitate aging in place and reduce high-cost, hospital- and institution-based interventions are desperately needed. Our proposed distributed sensor platform has the potential to address this need by enabling the timely detection of the mobility deficits that often precipitate the onset of frailty and proactive caregiver and technological interventions that can delay, or prevent, mobility loss. n/a","SCH: Multimodal,Task-Aware Movement Assessment and Control: Clinic to Home",10188391,R01AG067394,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Caregivers', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Life', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Patients', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Self-Help Devices', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'aging in place', 'base', 'cost', 'frailty', 'functional decline', 'functional electrical stimulation', 'functional status', 'human model', 'loss of function', 'multimodality', 'neuroprosthesis', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'technology development', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2021,289385
"Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of neurological disorders and affects over 2.5 million people each year, yet no treatment has successfully translated from bench to clinic. TBI is a broad term and encompasses an extremely heterogeneous set of injuries differing by cause, severity, biomechanics, and the varied, complex secondary injury responses that collectively result in chronic disabilities. Current preclinical research circumvents the issue of TBI heterogeneity by relying on specific preclinical animal models that mimic subpopulations of patients and particular secondary injury mechanisms with each study focusing on limited, individual pathways. This proposal instead aims to tackle TBI heterogeneity by approaching TBI as a “big data” problem and aggregating and analyzing the multidimensional data collectively. A framework for data harmonization and curation will be developed, and datasets from a consortium of preclinical labs employing a variety of preclinical TBI models will be collected and curated into an open data commons (ODC-TBI). Utilizing machine learning and multidimensional analytics, the proposed research will directly leverage TBI heterogeneity in the merged dataset to identify persistent features of TBI to empower translational research. By creating a preclinical TBI ODC and applying machine learning to integrate the heterogeneity of preclinical TBI models, the project will reveal multidimensional features of TBI across heterogeneous injuries and characterize how diverse secondary injury mechanisms interact and ultimately affect injury outcome. Throughout the project's timeline, new datasets will continue to be harmonized into the ODC-TBI according to the established framework. The ODC-TBI will be the first open multicenter, multi-model repository of preclinical TBI data and will enable the application of data science to the field of TBI. Furthermore, the ODC-TBI and the methods implemented throughout the project will be openly shared to improve reproducibility of TBI research. Together with the multidimensional analysis that will provide quantitative and qualitative understanding of TBI heterogeneity, the project aims to ultimately accelerate data- driven discovery and precision medicine for TBI. Reflecting the complexities of clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI), preclinical TBI research is confounded by the extreme heterogeneity prevalent across possible injury models and resulting biological responses. The proposed research will aggregate and curate an extensive open data commons (ODC) of preclinical TBI research with multiple TBI models and utilize machine learning to tackle TBI heterogeneity directly. The project will create an ODC for preclinical TBI research to improve data sharing and scientific reproducibility, and will empower translational TBI research by identifying multidimensional features of TBI that best predict functional outcome.",Leveraging Heterogeneity in Preclinical Traumatic Brain Injury to Drive Discovery and Reproducibility,10212363,F32NS117728,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomechanics', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Closed head injuries', 'Common Data Element', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'behavioral outcome', 'bench to bedside', 'biomarker discovery', 'controlled cortical impact', 'data curation', 'data framework', 'data harmonization', 'data sharing', 'disability', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic manipulation', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple datasets', 'nerve injury', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'open data', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'precision medicine', 'repository', 'response', 'response to injury']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2021,71224
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Maternal Antecedents and Electronic Fetal Monitoring in Term Asphyxia (MAESTRA) Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a neurologic syndrome that results from reduced flow of oxygenated blood to the fetal or newborn brain. HIE occurs in 1-3 per 1,000 term births and may cause death or neurologic disabilities such as cerebral palsy. Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) was developed in the 1970's to assess the adequacy of fetal oxygenation as a strategy to prevent HIE, and is now standard of care. Yet clinical trials report that EFM usage has not reduced the rate of CP, perinatal death or HIE, but is associated with a dramatic increase in cesarean deliveries. The currently used 3 Category fetal heart rate (FHR) classification system, based on simple rules designed to be easy to apply at the bedside, has some utility in predicting HIE. However, Category II FHR patterns that make up the vast majority of tracings are poorly predictive of HIE and confer “indeterminate” risk. Category III patterns are also of limited use in predicting HIE due to low sensitivity. There is an urgent need to develop better objective methods to assess EFM that would identify more fetuses at risk of HIE in time for corrective actions. Uterine tachysystole, or excessive frequency of uterine contractions, has been implicated as a preventable cause of HIE; yet studies report conflicting results. EFM research has been limited by an inability to access and manually analyze the large datasets needed to study HIE. We now have the ability to analyze digital EFM signals using automated methods to measure standard FHR patterns as well as to discover novel aspects of the tracing that may not be readily detectable by a clinician at the bedside. We hypothesize that modern signal processing and machine learning techniques can create highly predictive models of HIE by analyzing established and novel features of EFM tracings, in combination with demographic and pertinent clinical information from the mother and fetus. We propose a population-based retrospective cohort study of 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2010-19. Our specific aims are: 1) To create the MAESTRA Cohort dataset that links EFM recordings to HIE and neonatal acidosis among 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation in 2010-19 at Kaiser Permanente Northern CA; 2) Using modern signal processing and machine learning techniques, to extract established and novel FHR and uterine contractility features from the EFM recordings, and to determine which of these features are most predictive of HIE and acidosis when combined with maternal and fetal clinical data; and 3) To perform external validation by applying the final predictive models to a historical dataset. We anticipate that machine learning techniques incorporating novel FHR and uterine contractility patterns over time, as well as pre- and perinatal clinical characteristics, will improve the predictive value of the EFM data that are already being collected as part of routine care. Our results will inform future clinical trials. Such an unprecedented large-scale multidisciplinary study will lead to improvements in our ability to use EFM data to prevent neonatal brain injury while minimizing unnecessary cesarean sections. MAESTRA Project Narrative Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs when a baby gets reduced oxygen and blood flow to the brain, and can lead to death or long-term disabilities such as cerebral palsy. During labor and delivery, doctors are able to continuously record the heart rate of the fetus. This study will determine how best to use the heart rate information so that we can reduce the number of infants who develop this severe brain condition.",Maternal Antecedents and Electronic Fetal Monitoring in Term Asphyxia (MAESTRA),10145055,R01HD099216,"['Acidosis', 'Address', 'Apgar Score', 'Asphyxia', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'California', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cesarean section', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Educational workshop', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Heart Rate', 'Infant', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metabolic Brain Diseases', 'Metabolic acidosis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Brain Injury', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal anoxic ischemic brain injury', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'falls', 'fetal', 'fetus at risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'routine care', 'signal processing', 'standard measure', 'standard of care', 'uterine contractility']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,566881
"A Geometric and Morphoelastic Study of Aortic Dissection Evolution Project Summary/Abstract: The natural evolution of aortic dissection is notoriously unpredictable under current methods of evaluation and management. There is an urgent need to more completely elucidate the biomechanical stability of type B aortic dissections and identify signatures in the imaging data allowing for optimal patient classification based on aortic fragility. The long-term goal is the development and validation of image-based analysis algorithms to classify aortic stability and allow a personalized risk stratification for a given patient’s aortic geometry providing the basis for optimizing clinical management. The overall objective of this proposal is to utilize modern approaches in differential geometry, continuum mechanics, and computer vision to discover and characterize high-risk geometric structures hidden within computed tomography angiography (CTA) data of fragile aortas. The central hypothesis of this application is the existence of a fundamental link between aortic shape and aortic stability as it relates to the risk of aortic dissection and fragility. The rationale for this work is development of an easily translatable geometry and mechanics-based algorithm to predict dissection stability and intervention timing by discovering a richer and more nuanced mapping of aortic shapes hidden in existing patient imaging data. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) develop a modern geometric classification for aortic shapes, 2) develop a computational model that provides the mechanism underpinning the shape evolution of aortic dissections, and 3) develop a modern successor to the traditional ‘maximum diameter’ measure of aortic dissections that integrates geometric, finite element, and physiologic factors. Utilizing a large pre-identified CTA data set of normal and dissected aortas at various stages of disease and intervention, aim 1 will use tools from computer vision to reduce aortic shape to distributions of shape index and curvedness. Aim 2 will utilize advanced morphoelastic finite element growth models to discover the biomechanical mechanism underpinning aortic shape changes in aortic dissections and validate these models on patient specific geometries over clinically relevant time periods. These novel shape and mechanical stability classifiers will be used in both linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction methods to define aortic shape sub-spaces for different clinical scenarios in aim 3. This proposal is innovative as it challenges the status quo of evaluation and treatment by deploying novel measures and techniques that analyze clinically relevant aortic geometry and the evolution of aortic shape. Every patient is taken to the operating room under the full intent of having a positive clinical outcome. The research outlined is significant because it is expected to provide surgeons and patients a more discriminative framework with which to make better informed management decisions concerning type B aortic dissections and ultimately optimize outcomes. Project Narrative: The proposed research is relevant to public health because it seeks to inform upon the potential benefits of surgical versus medical intervention for type B aortic dissection through the development of modern geometric and mechanistically based selection criteria. Upon completion there will be a richer and more nuanced understanding of aortic stability as defined from computed tomography angiography imaging, which will allow for more optimal patient selection. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIH’s mission to enhance cardiovascular health and improve mortality.",A Geometric and Morphoelastic Study of Aortic Dissection Evolution,10280305,R01HL159205,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Aorta', 'Behavior', 'Biomechanics', 'Caliber', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Elasticity', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Image', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Selection Criteria', 'Shapes', 'Stress', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Walking', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'blood pressure variability', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinically relevant', 'density', 'differential geometry', 'geometric structure', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'preservation', 'risk stratification', 'simulation', 'surgical risk', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2021,459189
"Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression DESCRIPTION: Over the past decades, antidepressants and psychotherapy have been the first-line treatments for LLD. Despite being safe and well-tolerated, a large number of patients do not achieve full and persistent remission after initial treatment. About 50% of patients with LLD do not respond after two antidepressant trials, meeting the consensus definition of treatment resistance (TR-LLD). The persistence of chronic and elevated depressive symptoms in older adults has significant clinical and public health implications. This has been correlated to poor general health, reduced quality of life, and a higher risk of mortality when compared to those with sustained remission after treatment. Despite the relevance to public health of TR-LLD, there is little information about the biological mechanisms and no robust clinical prediction model to evaluate at the outset of antidepressant therapy who will or will not respond to treatment. Leveraging an NIMH funded clinical trial, the Incomplete Response in Late-Life Depression: Getting to Remission” (IRL-GREY), across 3 sites, in this study, we propose to evaluate the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression and to develop a machine learning based algorithm for prediction of treatment response in these subjects. We will carry out a comprehensive, multiplexed proteomic analysis on 542 samples from patients who completed phase 1 and phase 2 of the clinical trial. We hypothesise that ageing-related biological pathways (i.e. inflammatory response control, proteostasis control, cell damage response, endothelial function) will be associated with poorer treatment response in LLD. Moreover, we hypothesize that a machine learning derived biomarker panel will have sensitivity and specificity greater than 80% to predict treatment response in LLD. Finally, we will evaluate the biological mechanisms related to different depressive symptoms trajectories after treatment. This work will set the stage for a biologically-driven model of treatment response that will be useful to guide, at the outset of antidepressant treatment, those who will benefit more from a specific treatment. If successful, our work can accelerate therapeutic efforts and innovation targeting depression and reduce suffering for large numbers of elderly and their families. Using advanced molecular approaches, we will determine the biological mechanisms related to treatment response in late-life depression. Our proposed study will also develop a predictive tool combining neurocognitive, neuroimaging, and protein data to identify who with late-life depression is more likely to have no benefit from antidepressant treatment at the outset of therapy. The goal of the study is to clarify the mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression, and whether we can effectively identify those who will benefit from antidepressant therapy at the outset of treatment.",Evaluation of molecular mechanisms of treatment response in late-life depression,10129431,R01MH118311,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Aging', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Cell Cycle', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Disease remission', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Elderly', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Geroscience', 'Goals', 'Growth Factor', 'Health', 'Immune', 'Impaired cognition', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Depression', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'angiogenesis', 'aripiprazole', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'cell injury', 'cohort', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'geriatric depression', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'mortality risk', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'open label', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'proteostasis', 'recruit', 'response', 'therapy resistant', 'treatment response', 'treatment-resistant depression', 'venlafaxine']",NIMH,CENTRE FOR ADDICTION AND MENTAL HEALTH,R01,2021,490569
"The Ohio Valley Node of the Clinical Trials Network Project Summary (Abstract): Since its establishment in 2000, the Ohio Valley Node (OVN) has been one of the most productive of NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN) nodes, both in leading and participating in multi-site trials. The OVN includes successful partnerships with four healthcare systems, two pharmacy networks, and six addiction specialty/ infectious disease programs. These collaborating sites span a seven-state region including some of the states most heavily impacted by opioid (Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia) and methamphetamine (Missouri, Kentucky, and North Dakota) use. The OVN includes Midwestern, Appalachian, Upper South, and Native American representation, which significantly enhances the geographical and cultural diversity of the CTN. The OVN Research Core is the driving force of the OVN and is led by Dr. Winhusen, one of the foremost experts in conducting multi-site addiction clinical trials in clinical practice settings. The OVN investigators have extensive expertise in substance use disorders (Winhusen, Brown, Burlew, Lyons, Montgomery, Lofwall, Walsh) and bioinformatics (Kaelber, Xu). The six members of the OVN research-implementation team bring > 60 years of combined experience conducting CTN clinical trials. If funded, our overall goal would be to utilize the wealth of experience and expertise gained over the past 19 years to conduct the research needed to address public health care crises, including the opioid use epidemic and the alarming increase in stimulant use. To this end, we would work with our healthcare partners to engage a diverse set of patients and service systems in areas highly impacted by substance use in CTN research. We would also contribute our expertise in conducting efficacy, effectiveness, and implementation trials testing the full range of interventions, from medications to behavioral interventions and health service innovations, for both opioid and stimulant use disorders. Moreover, we would contribute our expertise in the use of electronic health records for prospective and retrospective research studies, including the application of artificial intelligence to large healthcare datasets. In sum, we seek to continue providing scientific leadership, particularly on studies that could meaningfully impact clinical practice, and to effectively collaborate with a variety of professionals including treatment providers, investigators from diverse institutions, and staff of the Center for CTN (CCTN), clinical coordinating center (CCC) and data and statistics center (DSC) in support of the CTN mission.

"A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease We propose to develop, optimize, and conduct first in-human measurements of our Magnetic Flexible Endoscope (MFE) robotic platform that may provide a safer and more intelligent alternative to standard colonoscopy (CLS) for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and therefore surveillance has been recommended to occur at intervals less than that recommended for the general population. Thus, over the course of their lifetime, they are subjected to more frequent CLS than their non-lBD counterparts, resulting in a more than 6-fold increase in adverse events. The main risks of CLS are related to procedural sedation, patient discomfort, or perforation of the colon from looping. Looping and mesenteric stretching occur due to the design of the colonoscope. Special maneuvers can be performed to minimize looping, making CLS a procedure that requires a great degree of technical skill and experience to perform safely. By using the proposed robotic platform, the endoscopist will be able to control the motion of the MFE to perform navigation, diagnosis, and therapy (i.e. biopsy, polyp removal/retrieval, injection) inside the human colon. MFE motion is achieved by magnetic coupling between an external permanent magnet (attached to a robotic arm outside the patient's body) and an internal permanent magnet (located inside the proximal head of the MFE). A small-diameter flexible tether between the head of the endoscope and the distal control module (outside the patient's body) allows for passage of commercially available therapeutic tools, insufflation, irrigation, suction/aspiration, and electrical wiring. Employing magnetic attraction at the head of the endoscope, for advancement and manipulation, permits the tether to follow passively-reducing the risk of mesenteric stretching or looping when compared to the traditional colonoscope. We will leverage our experience and extensive preliminary results to test the hypotheses that (1) intelligent robotic control and assistive autonomy in endoscopic tasks improves endoscopic performance, (2) quantifying the portion of colon lumen visualized provides valuable feedback to improve MFE operation and diagnostic yield, and (3) that the MFE is safe and successfully functions in the human colon in a manner similar to conventional CLS. The investigative team, combining engineering and clinical faculty, is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study-collectively possessing expertise in endoscopic device design, clinical CLS, assessment and validation of innovative gastrointestinal technologies, robotics, magnetism, image processing, artificial intelligence, and translation of research-engineering developments into clinical applications. Additionally, the investigators have a long-standing history of close and fruitful collaboration including R01 EB018992. If successful, this approach will demonstrate first in-human use of the MFE that reduces potential adverse events in an at-risk population (IBD patients), is intuitive to control, and integrates intelligent guidance into colon exploration and inspection. The robotic platform we propose has the potential to provide a safer, more accessible, and potentially painless alternative to standard colonoscopy for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's disease)-a disease that impacts the lives of over three million Americans, who are at a 6-fold increased risk for post-colonoscopy adverse events when compared to their non-lBD counterparts. The platform uses magnetic actuation, intelligent closed-loop control, and integrated assistive autonomy of our diagnostic and therapeutic magnetic flexible endoscope (MFE) to facilitate intuitive endoscopist-directed motion under precise control with a novel colon-visualization-index (CVI) that provides feedback to the endoscopist with estimates of the portion of colon lumen successfully imaged to maximize the yield of exam.

"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,10063814,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'detection limit', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352587
"Discovery and clinical validation of host  biomarkers of disease severity and multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) with Covid-19 ABSTRACT Novel approaches for early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 associated syndromes and evaluation of clinical severity and outcomes of COVID-19 disease in children are urgently needed. The overarching goal of this grant proposal is to develop clinical assays that can evaluate and predict severity of pediatric COVID-19 disease, ranging from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic to severe manifestations such as multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). To date, we have collected and biobanked clinical samples from more than 400 patients across 3 academic hospitals, including approximately 100 patients with MIS-C. In the first R61 phase of this project, we will continue to enroll patients with pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C for sample collection and longitudinal chart review and testing (Aim 1), leverage machine learning to identify diagnostic and prognostic “omics” host biomarkers based on RNA transcriptome profiling from nasal swab and whole blood samples (Aim 2) and cell-free DNA analysis from plasma (Aim 3), and generate predictive models of clinical severity and outcomes by incorporating longitudinal clinical, laboratory, viral, and omics data (Aim 4). Our rationale for including these samples is that they are routinely obtained in hospitals and clinics and permit easy and noninvasive collection without any special processing or handling requirements, which will accelerate the development of omics-based clinical assays. Our Go/No-Go transition milestones for transition to the R33 phase after 2 years include: (1) collection of longitudinal samples from a minimum of 120 patients for each identified presentation (mildly symptomatic outpatient, severely ill in the ICU, and MIS-C) and a comparable number of matched controls, (2) generation of panels of candidate of severity and confirmation of a subset of biomarkers by qPCR, (3) development of classifier models using machine learning using the biomarkers alone (for clinical assay development), and (4) combining these omics biomarkers with additional clinical, viral, and laboratory biomarkers into combined classifier models using machine learning. For the classifier models, the minimum/goal performance requirements would be 70%/>80% sensitivity and 80%/>90% specificity. In the second R33 phase, we propose to develop host-based clinical assays for diagnosis and severity prediction of COVID-19-associated syndromes, including MIS-C, in children from nasal swabs and blood (Aim 5) and validate these biomarker panels as a Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) in a CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) diagnostic laboratory (Aim 6). These assays will be evaluated for accuracy, precision, reproducibility, limits of detection (LOD), matrix effect, interference, among other performance characteristics.

"Understanding the mechanisms by which weight change affects progression of knee osteoarthritis in obese and overweight individuals: An analysis of the Osteoarthritis Initiative Dataset Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease which affects more than 27 million people in the US and is the single most common cause of disability in older adults. The number of people affected with symptomatic OA will increase due to the aging of the population and the growing number of people with obesity, which represents an established risk factor for OA. Obesity has become a US “epidemic,” and projections have suggested that 86.3% of adults in the United States will be overweight or obese by 2030. Obesity is a modifiable risk factor for OA with weight loss offering a potential non-invasive therapy for disease prevention in obese and overweight individuals. Research has shown that weight loss slows OA progression and weight gain exacerbates progression. However, these studies did not specifically assess factors or pathways which would be responsible for improved or worse outcomes, such as associated inflammation, local body composition and sarcopenia. In the current proposal, we will comprehensibly examine the mechanisms associated with mechanical loading (weight loss and gain) that are responsible for driving knee joint degenerative changes including cartilage loss, namely concurrent changes in inflammation, local body composition (periarticular fat), and muscle morphology and strength. Identifying which mechanism(s) are most beneficial for slowing OA progression during weight loss will lead to targeted therapies for effective and optimized treatment of OA at early stages of disease during which progression may be prevented. Through pathway analysis, mediation analysis, and machine learning, we will identify potential preventive measures (such as muscle strengthening and anti-inflammatory measures) that could amplify the positive effects of reduced mechanical loading on OA. Thus, the clinical impact of our project is development of a subject-specific prediction model for clinicians to individually-tailor treatment plans that slow joint breakdown, and decrease probability for invasive and costly surgeries such as total knee arthroplasty. Three specific aims are proposed: Specific Aim 1: We will characterize the associations between changes in weight with changes in knee joint inflammation, local body composition, muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), fat infiltration and muscle strength, and investigate the associations between these parameters and progression of knee degenerative changes. Specific Aim 2: Using a path analysis we will explore the mechanisms by which weight change impacts OA progression, and quantify the degree to which these factors mediate this relationship. Specific Aim 3: Finally, we will develop a prediction model using machine learning to determine which demographic, clinical, and MRI features (including changes in local body composition, inflammation, muscle) can predict progression of OA over 8 years. Project Narrative (Public Health Relevance) While obesity is a modifiable risk factor for osteoarthritis (OA), studies analyzing the impact of weight loss in overweight and obese people have found inconsistent results on structural progression of knee OA. One potential explanation for these findings, and at the same time a major gap of knowledge in previous research, is that studies have not specifically assessed factors or pathways which, together with mechanical load, are responsible for improved or worse outcomes, such as associated inflammation, local body composition and sarcopenia. The overall goal of our proposal is to elucidate which mechanisms are responsible for slowing progression during weight loss, and which are most beneficial to develop individualized treatment plans targeting specific pathways that will enhance the positive effects of weight loss on slowing OA progression.",Understanding the mechanisms by which weight change affects progression of knee osteoarthritis in obese and overweight individuals: An analysis of the Osteoarthritis Initiative Dataset,10180705,R01AR078917,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Epidemic', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Overweight', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Preventive measure', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Stress', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'base', 'cost', 'disability', 'disorder prevention', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'joint destruction', 'joint inflammation', 'knee replacement arthroplasty', 'mechanical load', 'modifiable risk', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'obese person', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'risk prediction model', 'sarcopenia', 'strength training', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,714433
"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for “just-in-time” tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to “learn” from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive “just-in-time” interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments.

"Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy PROJECT SUMMARY Injury is the most common cause of death in people younger than 46 years of age, and bleeding after injury is the most common cause of preventable death. Treatment of bleeding requires timely procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. Hospitals that specialize in treating injury have protocols, medications, devices and clinical staff available 24 hours a day and seven days a week. Injured people treated at specialized hospitals are more likely to live. However, there are far too many injured people every year than can be treated at specialized hospitals so minor injuries are cared for at hospitals not specialized in treating injuries. Severely injured people are taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries when specialized hospitals are too far away, or the emergency medical personnel underestimate how seriously injured someone is. Hospitals not specialized in treating injuries do not participate in ongoing injury clinical trials, regional data registries nor national quality improvement programs, and as a result what happens there that leads to people bleeding to death is unknown. This application's long-term objective is to improve the timeliness of treatment of bleeding after injury. The Specific Aims will be to: 1) understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in treating injuries; 2) identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment; and3) determine how to improve the timeliness of treatment. The central hypothesis is that treatment of bleeding is not standardized in hospitals not specialized in treating injuries and leads to a delay in transferring injured people to specialized hospitals. Identifying modifiable healthcare system, hospital, and patient factors can inform the design of a systematic process to quickly temporarily stabalize bleeding of injured people initially at non-specialized centers then expedite transfer to specialized hospitals by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals. This will ensure that people who are bleeding after injury are cared for at the right place at the right time. Ultimately, the right treatment at the right time will give people initially taken to hospitals not specialized in treating injuries the same chance at life as those taken to specialized hospitals. As a Career Development Award, the proposed training plan will include training in data science, systems engineering and design. The methods to be learned and employed will be machine learning, failure mode, effects and criticality analysis and user-centered design. The health relatedness of the project is to understand current practice management of bleeding after injury, in order to improve the timeliness of bleeding treatments to enhance the health of injured inviduals. PROJECT NARRATIVE Injury is the most common cause of death in people under 46 years old with more than 200,000 Americans dying annually. Bleeding accounts for 30% of deaths after injury, most of which are preventable if patients receive timely bleeding treatments including procedures to stop the bleeding as well as medications and blood transfusions to prevent blood thinning. The proposed resarch will understand how bleeding after injury is managed in hospitals that do and do not specialize in injury care, identify the reasons patients do not get timely treatment, and then create an improved systematic process by engaging key stakeholders from across the spectrum of hospitals caring for injured people.",Timeliness of Management of Trauma Related Hemorrhage and Trauma Related Coagulopathy,10203288,K23HL157832,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Adherence', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Area', 'Bleeding time procedure', 'Blood', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Devices', 'Emergency Medical Technicians', 'Emergency medical service', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic Agents', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patient Triage', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Practice Management', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Special Hospitals', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Work', 'blood product', 'clinical care', 'data modeling', 'data registry', 'design', 'engineering design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'injured', 'mortality', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'programs', 'prototype', 'severe injury', 'standardized care', 'stroke patient', 'supervised learning', 'time use', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'user centered design']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,K23,2021,190279
"Mathematical Modeling of Influenza Severity in Outbred Mice PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States, pulmonary influenza infection occurs annually in 5-20% of the population with mortality in the range of 30,000 deaths. The recent 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic illustrated the potential for higher infection rates, which were reported to be as high as 45% in certain age groups. The 2017-18 influenza season had the highest pediatric mortalities since the 2009 pandemic. Influenza infection is known to result in a broad spectrum of disease phenotypes in humans, although severe pneumonia is relatively rare. Despite this, severe disease often requires advanced supportive care in the young, including previously healthy children. Host factors involved in determining the outcome of influenza infection are unclear and children are known to be at higher risk of severe disease. First life exposure to influenza is also thought to dictate life-long immunity. Little is known about the effects of young age and gender on influenza responses and severity. This underscores the importance of understanding influenza pathogenesis in a pediatric population. Influenza pathogenesis is likely mediated in large part by exuberant inflammatory host responses in the lung. It is likely that predictive soluble inflammatory mediators are present in severe infection. Further, predictive biomarkers or mathematical models of influenza pneumonia severity would enhance clinical decision making and patient care. We propose that machine learning and mathematical modeling of host immune endpoints will define a molecular fingerprint of severe influenza pneumonia in juveniles. This hypothesis will be tested in two Aims. Aim 1 will focus on characteristic molecular pathways related to influenza severity in juvenile animals, using outbred mice. We will utilize machine learning and new mathematical approaches for pathway and biomarker selection. Aim 2 will test mathematical models of influenza pathogenesis to elucidate new mechanisms that drive lung injury. The overall goal of the proposed study is to identify novel biomarkers and mechanistic models of influenza pneumonia severity that can be applied to children. To accomplish this we will use a broad, exploratory, and unbiased approach. Candidate biomarkers and pathways would then be evaluated in future mechanistic and translational studies in mice and humans. NARRATIVE  Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children worldwide. There is a critical clinical need for biomarkers and models that predict influenza pneumonia severity in children. The goal of this study is to address this unmet need using an outbred mouse model of pediatric influenza pneumonia and well established mathematical approaches to inform future translational studies in children.",Mathematical Modeling of Influenza Severity in Outbred Mice,10143642,R21AI153882,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Cytokine Receptors', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histology', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunologics', 'Infection', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Seasons', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Supportive care', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Vaccines', 'Viral Load result', 'Virus', 'age group', 'base', 'biomarker selection', 'candidate marker', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'disease phenotype', 'high risk', 'immunopathology', 'infection rate', 'influenza infection', 'influenza pneumonia', 'juvenile animal', 'lung injury', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'pandemic disease', 'pandemic influenza', 'pathogen', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'pulmonary function', 'response', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational study']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,228212
"A novel microfluidic platform to study exosome biology in PAH. The endothelium is the cellular monolayer that covers the inner lining of the entire circulatory system. Endothelial dysfunction is a feature of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a life-threatening disease associated with abnormally high pulmonary pressures and chronic right heart failure. Due to the limitations of available static cell culture and animal models, our understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate the initiation and perseverance of endothelial dysfunction in PAH remains incomplete. Given that endothelial dysfunction is a common finding in PAH, an understanding of the mechanism behind maladaptive endothelial responses could help accelerate the discovery of novel therapies for PAH. Presently, it is believed that endothelial derived exosomes contribute to PAH by carrying signals that trigger maladaptive endothelial responses in the setting of injury. Exosomes are cell-derived small (~30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles that carry proteins, metabolites and nucleic acids involved in a variety of physiological and pathological processes. While it is known that exosomes carry molecular and genetic factors associated with angiogenesis, inflammation and vasoreactivity, a comprehensive assessment of exosome cargo of healthy and dysfunctional PMVECs has been hindered by current low-yield exosome isolation techniques. These techniques cannot perform real-time dynamic exosome isolation from pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) exposed to PAH-associated stressors. To address this unmet need, we have designed the MFES (Multifunctional Exosome Sorter) that can dissect the whole exosome population into subpopulations based on size and surface markers. MFES is the first lab-on-a-chip platform that integrates: 1) a vessel-on-a-chip module for real-time characterization of PMVEC functional responses across a wide range of physiological and pathological parameters, 2) a module for high-yield exosome size-based isolation, 3) a surface marker based exosome sorting using magnetic beads, and 4) multi-omics phenotyping of exosomes of PMVECs. Here, we are proposing a technology that can enable broadly to investigate the two main defining characteristics of exosomal subtypes, i.e., size and surface markers, both separately independently, and in combination sequentially. We will characterize changes in exosome cargo in healthy and PAH PMVECs exposed to shear stress-related conditions in the MFES. We will isolate subpopulations of exosomes based on size and surface markers and characterize them for their cargo (Aim 1). Then, we will determine whether exosomes derived from stressed PMVECs can induce pathological changes in healthy PMVECs cultured in a microfluidic culture chip (Aim 2). This technological innovation enables to study endothelial exosome biology in a setting that represents the flow dynamics associated with PAH. Further, the use of cutting-edge -omics technologies, bioinformatic analysis integrated with machine learning algorithms to analyze the purified exosomes is expected to yield a comprehensive dataset of exosome cargo profiles and open exciting opportunities for investigating the biological role of exosomes in PAH pathobiology and the testing of novel therapeutic agents. Due to the limitations of available static cell culture and animal models, our understanding of the mechanisms that orchestrate the initiation and perseverance of endothelial dysfunction in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) remains incomplete. The endothelial cell derived exosomes, small (~30-150 nm) extracellular vesicles, contribute to PAH by carrying signals that trigger maladaptive endothelial responses in the setting of injury via molecular and genetic factors associated with angiogenesis, inflammation and vasoreactivity. However, a comprehensive assessment of exosomal cargo of healthy and dysfunctional pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) has been hindered by current low-yield exosome isolation techniques that integrates real-time exosome capture from PMVECs exposed to PAH-associated high shear stress. We propose to develop a lab-on-a-chip platform technology, Multifunctional Exosome Sorter (MFES), that can dissect the whole exosome population into subpopulations based on size and surface markers integrating; (i) a vessel-on-a-chip module, (ii) a high-yield exosome size-based isolation module, (iii) a magnetic bead-based surface biomarker sorting chamber, and (iv) multi-omics phenotyping of exosomes investigating the biological role of exosomes in PAH pathobiology, where such a technological innovation will uniquely enable to study the biology of exosome subsets associated with flow dynamics in PAH.",A novel microfluidic platform to study exosome biology in PAH.,10158068,R21HL156761,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Vessels', 'CD81 gene', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Culture Media', 'Cultured Cells', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Models', 'Exposure to', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Heart failure', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Lab-On-A-Chips', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteomics', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stress', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vision', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cytokine', 'design', 'endothelial dysfunction', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'hemodynamics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic beads', 'monolayer', 'multiple omics', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pressure', 'protein metabolite', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shear stress', 'stressor', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,236363
"Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression Project Summary / Abstract The objective of the proposed research is to better understand how peripheral blood epigenetic patterns are associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). A great deal of work has already been demonstrated widespread epigenetic changes within articular tissues in both knee and hip OA. Others have described serum and urine protein biomarkers as predictors of future knee OA progression. Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time.

Our first Aim is to evaluate peripheral blood cell DNA epigenetic patterns in baseline blood samples from patients who will go on to have rapid radiographc and/or pain progression in the subsequent 24 months. We will then use these data to develop develop and evaluate the performance of epigenetic algorithmic models to discriminate these groups. Patient samples will parallel the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarkers Consortium (OABC-FNIH) study. DNA methylation will be evaluated using a next-generation bisulfite sequencing approach (methylSeq), and algorithms developed using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. We will then translate our findings into a more high- throughput, inexpensive, and clinically relevant form by developing and validating a targeted capture sequencing system to interrogate these specific epigenetic locations. Our second Aim is to evaluate the peripheral blood DNA methylation patterns that precede the development of OA, using samples from 48-, 24-, 12-, and 0-months before incident OA. We will again develop algorithms to predict future OA development using similar techniques as Aim 1 and translate this to a targeted capture sequencing system. This unique longitudinal approach which will allow us not only to determine whether and when epigenetic patterns develop preceding OA development, but also track longitudinal epigenetic changes as OA develops. The proposed work is important, as there are no FDA approved biomarkers for OA diagnosis or prognosis. Our work is quite innovative both in its combination of ""big data"" epigenetic analysis and cutting-edge machine learning techniques applied to a specific clinical problem, as well as in its examination of PBMC epigenetics in OA, which has not yet been described. Moreover, we tackle the problem of translation of big-data research by aiming specifically to develop high-throughput methods to translate our findings into a clinically-relevant and accessible form. Success in our proposal will produce both algorithmic models with direct clinical impact to predict future OA development and progression, as well as broaden our understanding of epigenetic changes in peripheral blood cells from OA patients. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because a better understanding of blood epigenetic patterns in osteoarthritis (OA) is likely not only to give insights into the causes of OA, but also to give rise to new biomarkers to assist physicians and researchers diagnose OA patients and predict how rapidly they will worsen over time. Thus, this proposal is relevant to the part of the NIH's mission that pertains to fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately improving health.",Peripheral blood mononuclear cell epigenetic associations in and biomarkers for knee osteoarthritis development and progression,10236819,R01AR076440,"['Affect', 'Age-Years', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood specimen', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'FDA approved', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Joints', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Musculoskeletal Diseases', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'bisulfite', 'bisulfite sequencing', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'deep sequencing', 'disability', 'economic impact', 'epigenetic marker', 'epigenome', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'joint function', 'methylation pattern', 'model development', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'protein biomarkers', 'sodium bisulfite', 'subchondral bone', 'success', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'targeted sequencing']",NIAMS,OKLAHOMA MEDICAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION,R01,2021,354795
"Severity Predictors Integrating salivary Transcriptomics and proteomics with Multi neural network Intelligence in SARS-CoV2 infection in Children (SPITS MISC) Abstract Children have been disproportionately less impacted by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) compared to adults. However, severe illnesses including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) and respiratory failure have occurred in a small proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nearly 80% of children with MIS-C are critically ill with a 2-4% mortality rate. Currently there are no modalities to characterize the spectrum of disease severity and predict which child with SARS-CoV-2 exposure will likely develop severe illness including MIS-C. Thus there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic modality to distinguish the varying phenotypes of disease and risk stratify disease. The epigenetic changes in microRNA (miRNA) profiles that occur due to an infection can impact disease severity by altering immune response and cytokine regulation which may be detected in body fluids including saliva. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes of children with SARS-CoV-2 by early identification and treatment of those at risk for severe illness. Our central hypothesis is that a model that integrates salivary biomarkers with social and clinical determinants of health will predict disease severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The central hypothesis will be pursued through phased four specific aims. The first two aims will be pursued during the R61 phase and include: 1) Define and compare the salivary molecular host response in children with varying phenotypes (severe and non severe) SARS-CoV-2 infections and 2) Develop and validate a sensitive and specific model to predict severe SARS-CoV-2 illness in children. During the R33 phase we will pursue the following two aims: 3) Develop a portable, rapid device that quantifies salivary miRNAs with comparable accuracy to predicate technology (qRT-PCR), and 4) Develop an artificial intelligence (AI) assisted cloud and mobile system for early recognition of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. We will pursue the above aims using an innovative combination of salivaomics and bioinformatics, analytic techniques of AI and clinical informatics. The proposed research is significant because development of a sensitive model to risk stratify disease is expected to improve outcomes of children with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection via early recognition and timely intervention. The proximate expected outcome of this proposal is better understanding of the epigenetic regulation of host immune response to the viral infection which we expect to lead to personalized therapy in the future. The results will have a positive impact immediately as it will lead to the creation of patient profiles based on individual risk factors which can enable early identification of severe disease and appropriate resource allocation during the pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is relevant to public health as development of a predictive model that integrates salivary biomarkers with clinical and social determinants into a bedside tool will enable early identification of severe COVID-19 in children, ensure appropriate resource allocation and aid in targeted treatment.",Severity Predictors Integrating salivary Transcriptomics and proteomics with Multi neural network Intelligence in SARS-CoV2 infection in Children (SPITS MISC),10273618,R61HD105610,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Coronavirus', 'Critically ill children', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Immune response', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Intelligence', 'Interleukin-10', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 genome', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Saliva', 'Salivary', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Virus Diseases', 'Virus Replication', 'base', 'cloud based', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'epigenetic regulation', 'experience', 'health data', 'immunoregulation', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pandemic disease', 'personalized medicine', 'point of care', 'portability', 'potential biomarker', 'predictive modeling', 'profiles in patients', 'risk stratification', 'severe COVID-19', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social health determinants', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'web portal']",NICHD,CENTRAL MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY,R61,2021,735449
