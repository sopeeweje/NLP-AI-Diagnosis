"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features. The training and pilot data will be necessary for Dr. Dreizin’s long- term goal of research independence and R01 support to develop automated segmentation algorithms for the spectrum of clinically important imaging features after pelvic trauma, as well as fully automated multivariable clinical prediction tools with potential for translation to industry and as an FDA-cleared product. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement. We propose to develop automated software for hemorrhage-detection, and real-time risk prediction software for major arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures.",Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures,9819865,K08EB027141,"['Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arterial Injury', 'Award', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Caliber', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Crush Injury', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Extravasation', 'Fall injury', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maryland', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability Theory', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shorthand', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Vehicle crash', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse outcome', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer infrastructure', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'heuristics', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle form', 'neural network architecture', 'outcome prediction', 'pelvis fracture', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'radiologist', 'random forest', 'real time model', 'secondary outcome', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K08,2019,186183,0.061948156843385456
"Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease ABSTRACT The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Elsie Ross, Assistant Professor of Surgery (Vascular Surgery) and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics Research) at Stanford University, the support necessary to transition her from a junior investigator into an independent surgeon-scientist in translational biomedical informatics. Dr. Ross is a vascular surgeon with an advanced degree in health services research and postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics. Her long-term goal is to combine her interdisciplinary training to develop and implement machine learning tools that will enable the delivery of precise, high-value care to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Her career development activities focus on advancing her ability to translate informatics discoveries into viable clinical tools by 1) completing didactic courses to deepen and expand her knowledge of deep learning algorithms, clinical trials and implementation science, 2) designing and conducting her first independent human subjects clinical research study evaluating the performance of machine learning technology, 3) implementing and evaluating the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based screening tool to identify latent vascular disease, and 4) strengthening her previous training in cost-effectiveness analysis to enable her future aim of evaluating the associated costs and utility of pro-active, automated disease screening. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr. Nigam Shah, a biomedical informatics expert who combines machine learning, text-mining and medical ontologies to enable a learning health care system; Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey a world-expert in cardiovascular clinical trials; and Dr. Paul Heidenreich, an expert in implementation sciences with a focus on the use of EHR interventions to improve care quality for cardiovascular patients and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new technologies. The research proposal builds on the candidate's prior work with using machine learning and EHR data to evaluate and predict cardiovascular disease outcomes. The candidate now proposes to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms in identifying patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) using EHR data (Aim 1), evaluate whether learned classification models perform better than traditional risk factors for identification of undiagnosed PAD in a prospective patient cohort (Aim 2), and implement an EHR-based screening tool to identify patients with undiagnosed PAD and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment effects (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will result in a novel, EHR-based screening tool for identification of undiagnosed vascular disease that can decrease PAD-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through earlier and more aggressive medical management. This research will also form the basis for an R01 application before the end of the award to conduct a multi-site randomized-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of EHR- based proactive PAD screening. ! ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease is a prevalent yet under-diagnosed condition that can lead to limb loss, stroke, heart attacks and/or premature death.

"Development of Accurate and Interpretable Machine Learning Algorithms for their application in Medicine Project Summary  The objective of this proposal is to provide a robust course of training for Gilmer Valdes, PhD, DABR, a candidate with an excellent foundation in clinical and machine learning research, to enable him to become an independent investigator. The proposed research aims to address a tradeoff between interpretability and accuracy of modern machine learning algorithms which limits their use in clinical practice. The candidate’s central hypothesis is that the current tradeoff is not a law of nature but rather a limitation of current interpretable machine learning algorithms. Towards proving this hypothesis, the candidate, leading a multidisciplinary team, have developed unique mathematical frameworks (MediBoost and the Conditional Interpretable Super Learner) to build interpretable and accurate models. The proposed research will I) implement and extensively benchmark these frameworks and II) use the algorithms develop to solve three clinical problems where potentially suboptimal models are currently used to make clinical decisions: 1) predicting mortality in the Intensive Care Unit, 2) predicting risk of Hospital Acquired Venous Thromboembolism, 3) predicting which prostate cancer patients benefit the most from adjuvant radiotherapy. The candidate’s training and research plan, multidisciplinary by nature, takes advantage of the proximity of UC San Francisco, Stanford and UC Berkeley and proposes a training plan that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere. Recognizing the multidisciplinary nature of the work proposed, the author will be mentored and work closely with a stellar committee from three institutions and different scientific areas (Machine Learning, Biostatistics, Statistics, Hospital Medicine, Cancer Research and Quality Assurance in Medicine): Jerome H. Friedman PhD (Stanford Statistics Department), Mark Van der Laan PhD (Berkeley Biostatistics and Statistics Department), Mark Segal (UCSF Epidimiology and Biostatistics Deparments), Andrew Auerbach MD (UCSF Medicine Department), Felix Y. Feng MD (UCSF Radiation Oncology),and Timothy D. Solberg PhD (UCSF Radiation Oncology). This committee will be coordinated by Dr Solberg. The candidate also counts with a strong a multidisciplinary team of collaborators. Successful completion of the proposed research will develop the next generation of accurate and interpretable Machine Learning algorithms and solve three important clinical problems where linear models are currently used in clinical settings. This proposal has wide-ranging implications across the healthcare spectrum. The intermediate-term goal is for the candidate to acquire the knowledge, technical skills and expertise necessary to submit a successful R01 proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current state of the art machine learning algorithms have a marked tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. In medicine, where errors can have a dire consequence and knowledge representation and validation is as relevant as accuracy, the development of accurate and interpretable algorithms is of paramount importance. My research project will address a critical public health need by developing machine learning algorithms that are both accurate and interpretable, and apply them to solve specific clinical problems.",Development of Accurate and Interpretable Machine Learning Algorithms for their application in Medicine,9743021,K08EB026500,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Radiotherapy', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Libraries', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Polynomial Models', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Structure', 'Survival Analysis', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Thromboembolism', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'artificial neural network', 'asthmatic patient', 'classification trees', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'improved', 'information organization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'random forest', 'regression trees', 'standard care', 'statistics', 'task analysis', 'theories']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K08,2019,191912,0.026796885261266053
"Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning Project Summary Dr. Pappas is a junior faculty member in the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, with appointments in the Center for Value-Based Care Research and the Department of Hospital Medicine (Cleveland, OH). This career development award aims to provide training in propensity methods, deep learning techniques, and pilot intervention development, ultimately seeking to identify personalized approaches to cardiac stress testing before surgery. Noncardiac surgery carries risk of mortality and morbidity, and cardiac complications account for the largest share of perioperative mortality. Meanwhile, current approaches are expensive and may not effectively reduce cardiac risk. This proposal uses machine learning techniques to define the value of information provided by each different kind of stress test and the expected benefit of different therapeutic interventions through which preoperative risks might be modified. It then seeks to identify the most helpful cardiac stress test, if any. In this career development award, Dr. Pappas proposes three phases of investigation, and in so doing will acquire new skills critical to achieving his goal of becoming an expert in perioperative risk mitigation. In Aim 1, Dr. Pappas will use propensity matching techniques to evaluate prior associations between preoperative stress testing and improved postoperative mortality, when including rich clinical data not available to previous large studies. In Aim 2, he will use machine learning techniques to estimate the value of information provided by each modality of stress testing, and the impact on the risk of each event from each intervention. In Aim 3, Dr. Pappas will pilot an intervention presenting personalized estimates to physicians in the preoperative clinic. In addition to advanced training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in perioperative outcomes research, cardiovascular disease, use of observational healthcare data, and machine learning. The combination of formal training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Pappas will emerge from this award as an independent investigator and expert in personalized perioperative decision-making. Project Narrative Many patients die soon after surgery, and many of those deaths are from heart problems. Physicians have tried to reduce those risks in many ways, but our current approach is expensive, leads to unhelpful testing, and probably doesn't do a very good job reducing the risk of death. This proposal uses a form of machine learning and a large dataset to try to find more personalized, more helpful, and less expensive strategies to try to reduce the risks of surgery, and then tests whether we can present personalized estimates to doctors that they could use when thinking about the risks of surgery.",Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning,9664901,K08HL141598,"['Appointment', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hospital Departments', 'Information Theory', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Stress Tests', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'functional status', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'perioperative mortality', 'personalized approach', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic value', 'randomized trial', 'risk mitigation', 'skills', 'surgical risk', 'therapy development', 'treatment center']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K08,2019,161047,0.053970255975960585
"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques. We propose leveraging state of the art deep learning models built using data from hospitals and insurers to both predict which pregnancies will result in preterm birth and to predict which preterm infants will experience severe cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.",Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning,9928552,K01HL141771,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Accounting', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Boston', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cardiac', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Graduate Degree', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Human Pathology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Outcome', 'Patent Ductus Arteriosus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Premature Labor', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'education planning', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'peer', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'social', 'statistics']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2019,166320,0.03400092777049754
"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups),9645316,K01HL144607,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mexican Americans', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Puerto Rican', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'South Asian', 'Stable Populations', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'college', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'epidemiologic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health difference', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevention service', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'random forest', 'risk prediction model', 'side effect', 'skills', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,172692,0.06859129451938052
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position.

"Real-time Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction and Registration for Laparoscopic-guided Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Liver deformation leads to difficulties in tumor localization during minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS). The goal of this proposal is to develop an efficient surgical navigation tool for MILS by compensating for liver deformation and mapping preoperative data to the patient’s anatomy. Specifically, we will develop a non-rigid simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) approach to estimate the deformation of liver surface from stereo laparoscopy videos. We will develop machine-learning methods to detect landmarks and perform non- rigid registration. The algorithms will be implemented on a GPU to achieve real-time. Preliminary data has demonstrated the feasibility. During the R00 phase, we will mainly address the clinical needs and develop novel ways to provide intraoperative guidance. This project will greatly improve the tumor resection accuracy in MILS. The candidate for this award Dr. Haoyin Zhou is a postdoc at Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). Dr. Zhou has extensive experience and expertise in computer vision, machine learning and their applications in medicine. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. National Center for Image Guided Therapy, and Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided Operating (AMIGO) suite will greatly support this research. Dr. Zhou’s long-term research goal is to develop and apply advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of medical image processing and image-guided therapy. To achieve these goals, Dr. Zhou plans to receive more education and training in the following four areas: (1) Critical training in conducting translational research in the hospital environment with surgeons and radiologists, (2) knowledge in the development of technologies for surgical guidance, (3) training in machine learning and its applications in medicine, and (4) training on writing grant applications independently and seeking funding. Dr. Zhou will participate in formal courses selected from Harvard, Harvard Catalyst, MIT CSAIL and Stanford Courses. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH, HMS and MIT. He will also attend one or two academic conferences per year to discuss his work and meet with experts in the field.

"Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess and Train Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis during Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CANDIDATE (Andrew J. Hung, MD): My long-term goal is to establish a career in innovating training methods for robotic surgery which will lead to curtailing surgeon learning curve, and maximize patient safety. My first step towards that goal focuses on understanding objective metrics that measure surgeon performance, and how machine learning algorithms can process that data to guide training. I have developed a career development program that builds on my clinical training in robotic urologic surgery and prior research in surgical training. Through mentorship, a fellowship, and formal coursework, this K23 award will provide me the necessary support to develop expertise in 3 areas where I do not have formal training, yet are critical to my success: (1) Machine learning; (2) Surgical education; (3) Advanced statistical skills and study design. MENTORING TEAM: My career development and research plans leverage existing institutional resources, including the USC Machine Learning Center, led by co-primary mentor Dr. Yan Liu; and Keck Hospital of USC, the second busiest robotic center by volume in the United States and the USC Institute of Urology (led by co- primary mentor and chairman Dr. Inderbir Gill), home to pioneers of several urologic surgical techniques with a robust research apparatus supporting several NIH-funded clinical scientists. My mentoring team is complemented by co-mentor Dr. Robert Sweet, a DOD-funded expert on surgical education; career mentor Dr. Larissa Rodriguez, a federally funded clinician/scientist experienced in mentoring K awardees; educational psychology collaborator Dr. Kenneth Yates, an authority on cognitive task analysis; and consultant Dr. Anthony Jarc, at Intuitive Surgical who has supported much of the pilot data on objective performance metrics. The proposed K23 work truly requires the robust collaboration of experts in robotic surgery, education, and machine learning. RESEARCH: The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is steep: over 100 cases. Current ‘gold standard’ methods of surgical assessment rely on subjective expert review, but such evaluations are time consuming and inconsistent. Nonetheless, credentialing a surgeon to perform robotic surgery has enormous implications - patient outcomes are at risk, and a surgeon’s career is on the line. Informed by my clinical expertise in robotic urological surgery and preliminary data, I will develop a novel method of utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms to objectively assess robotic surgeon performance and to guide training for the vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA), the most critical reconstructive part of the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). I will develop and validate objective metrics directly captured from the da Vinci robot during the VUA (Aim 1), train machine learning algorithms to assess a surgeon’s performance of VUA (Aim 2), and utilize ML algorithms to guide surgeons learning the VUA (Aim 3). Armed with these data and skills from this award, I will be uniquely suited to utilize machine learning to generalize objective surgeon assessment for robot-assisted surgical procedures within and beyond urology. Finally, the results from this study will provide preliminary data for independent funding through mechanisms such as an NIH R01 grant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer is steep, and current methods of evaluating surgeons require subjective and time-consuming expert review. Streamlined training and assessment utilizing objective performance metrics and machine learning algorithms can significantly curtail learning curve with patients, and decrease the overall morbidity of prostate cancer treatment.",Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess and Train Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis during Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy,9767765,K23EB026493,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Chairperson', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Credentialing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational Psychology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Specialist', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urethra', 'Urologic Surgical Procedures', 'Urology', 'Work', 'authority', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive task', 'common treatment', 'computer program', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'peer', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'robot assistance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'task analysis', 'urologic', 'virtual reality']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K23,2019,193082,0.0737958782842866
"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,9717330,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Structure', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2019,176541,0.07170789336603792
"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,9721752,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health administration', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2019,203040,0.0693116515921385
"Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation Project Summary Candidate Goals and Objectives: With a background in Information Systems and Management, and Biostatistics, Dr. Zhang has demonstrated research records on electronic health record data mining to identify patterns of healthcare delivery that may be used to inform patient-centered and evidence-based healthcare. The proposal will provide additional training for Dr. Zhang on advanced machine learning, statistics, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics for applications on clinical decision support (CDS). Dr. Zhang's long-term goal is to bringing innovation CDS development and evaluation through novel biomedical informatics and data science techniques. Institutional Environment and Career Development: Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) provides ideal research facilities and training environment for Dr. Zhang. Dr. Jyotishman Pathak, Chief of Division of Health Informatics at Department of Health Policy and Research, will lead a multidisciplinary team of mentors: Drs. Jessica Ancker and Fei Wang at WCM, and Dr. Adam Wright at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Zhang also has collaborators in WCM and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital who will support her in her training and research activities and provide clinical expertise. Research Aims Order sets are a type of CDS in computerized provider order entry (CPOE) to standardize decision making in the ordering process and encourage compliance with clinical practice guidelines. Previous literature on order set use has focused its effect on usability, workload, and physician satisfaction, but a knowledge gap remains with respect to the effect of order sets on care outcomes. The overall goal of the research study is to create a continuous improvement cycle for order sets with respect to a care outcome by rigorously learning from data. Aim 1 of the study will apply computational phenotyping and subtyping algorithms to identify cohorts of heart failure (HF) subtypes. Aim 2 will evaluate an existing order set intended for the care of HF patients on a care outcome defined as 30-day all-cause, unplanned readmission with a hypothesis that the use of this order set is associated with a better outcome. This will be achieved by building a range of outcome prediction models and evaluating the strength of each order set order as a predictor. Aim 3 will optimize the existing order sets using a metaheuristic optimization method such that its content collectively may have the largest positive effect on the outcome of 30-day all-cause unplanned readmission. The effects of order set use on the care outcome is measured using a causal inference technique in each iteration. The expected outcome is a framework to develop and evaluate HF order sets which may eventually be generalized to other clinical areas. Training from this proposal may lead to multi-site R01 studies of outcome-driven HF order sets and actual implementations. Project Narrative In this study, we propose a continuous improvement cycle to develop, manage, and evaluate outcome-driven order sets, a type of clinical decision support (CDS) for computerized provider order entry (CPOE). Mentorship and training include advanced statistics, machine learning, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics. The proposed research will leverage the principal investigator (PI)'s background in methodology development and health information systems to provide the PI with additional training to innovate outcome-driven CDS for CPOE.","Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation",9871053,K01LM013257,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health Information System', 'Health Policy', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Management', 'Information Systems', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Training', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Models', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care outcomes', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'computerized physician order entry', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health care delivery', 'health care service organization', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'inpatient service', 'long short term memory', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilayer perceptron', 'neural network algorithm', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'personalized decision', 'predictive modeling', 'random forest', 'recurrent neural network', 'research facility', 'research study', 'satisfaction', 'social health determinants', 'statistics', 'success', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NLM,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K01,2019,184191,0.033994975916721036
"Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy Abstract  In this SBIR project, we present EyeMark, a set of advanced image analysis tools for automated computation of biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy (DR) using retinal fundus images. Specifically, we will develop tools for computation of microaneurysm (MA) ap- pearance and disappearance rates (jointly known as turnover rates) for use as a bi- omarker in quantifying DR progression risk along with longitudinal analysis of other DR lesions. The availability of a reliable image-based biomarker will have high positive influ- ence on various aspects of DR care, including screening, monitoring progression, drug discovery and clinical research.  Measuring MA turnover and longitudinal analysis of DR lesions involves two labor in- tensive steps: careful alignment of current and baseline images, and marking of individual lesions. This process is very time consuming and prone to error, if done entirely by human graders. The primary goal of this project is to overcome these limitations by automating both the steps involved in longitudinal analysis: accurate image registration, and lesion identification.  We have designed and developed a MA turnover computation prototype tool that ro- bustly registers longitudinal images (even with multiple lesion changes) and effectively detects DR lesions (lesion level AUROC>=0.95). The tool provides graceful degradation to confounding image factors by reporting MA turnover as a range, thereby capturing the inherent confidence in MA detection. By the end of Phase IIB we will develop a market ready, clinically validated end-to-end desktop software for robust, automated longitudinal lesion analysis and characterization that can work on the cloud to produce results in near constant time (for large datasets), and also provide intuitive visualization tools for clinicians to more effectively monitor DR progression. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeMark, will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients by providing an automated tool for computation of an image- based, reliable, DR biomarker in a non-invasive manner. This will enable identification of patients who are at higher risk to progress to severe retinopathy, thus helping prevent vision loss in such patients by timely intervention. Early identification is especially important in face of long backlog of diabetic patients waiting for an eye examination, and the fact that 90% of vision loss can be saved by early identification. The availability of an effective biomarker will also positively influence the drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable determination of biological efficacy of potential new therapies.",Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy,9735477,R44TR000377,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Services', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Microaneurysm', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pear', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fundus imaging', 'high risk', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'macula', 'medical schools', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'screening program', 'serial imaging', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NCATS,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2019,750000,0.04210126795750722
"Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT Project Summary  In some individuals chronic tobacco smoke exposure results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. Both of these parenchymal changes are irreversible, highlighting the importance of the early identification of their development and progression. Unfortunately, currently available methods for detecting the presence and evolution of these changes have limited sensitivity and specificity for very early disease and for subtle disease progression. Dr. Ash’s work has shown that automated objective analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest can detect clinically relevant radiologic findings called interstitial changes that may represent early pulmonary fibrosis, even in individuals without visually apparent disease. In the first aim of this proposal, Dr. Ash will refine and utilize a more sensitive and specific automated CT analysis tool that he and his lab have developed for the detection of both emphysema and interstitial changes. He will determine if emphysema and interstitial changes detected using this method are clinically significant in those patients deemed normal by previously performed visual analysis and in those deemed normal by other objective approaches. In the second aim, he will determine if areas of locally high density tissue in visually normal appearing lung parenchyma measured using augmented versions of his objective analysis tools are associated with mortality, other clinical outcomes, and peripheral measures of inflammation. Finally, in the third aim he will utilize these techniques to analyze longitudinal CT scans from the COPDGene study that were obtained over 10 years of follow-up, and will identify factors that predict or modify the development and progression of parenchymal changes on CT.  Dr. Ash will perform this work in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), a core teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, under the mentorship of Dr. George Washko, an expert in the field of medical image analysis and the co-principal investigator of the Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory at BWH. With the guidance of Dr. Washko and his scientific advisory committee, Dr. Ash has developed a comprehensive five year training program to develop the skills needed to become an independent investigator with expertise in quantitative image analysis, including predictive modeling and statistical machine learning.  Dr. Ash is dedicated to a career in academic medicine. His goal is to become a clinician-scientist using the skills gained during this award to improve our ability to detect and monitor smoking related lung disease. The techniques he has proposed may help identify modifiable risk factors and treatments for smoking related lung disease, determine which patients are likely to benefit from treatment, and monitor the response to therapy. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, but only in a minority of smokers. This proposal aims to use advanced objective analysis of chest computed tomography images to detect the earliest manifestations of smoking related lung disease. This will enable us to identify susceptible patients at the earliest possible moment, track their disease progression, and ultimately shift treatment strategies from palliating disease related symptoms to preventing disease development.",Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT,9646808,K08HL145118,"['Advisory Committees', 'Area', 'Award', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Densitometry', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Evolution', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predictive Factor', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Symptoms', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chest computed tomography', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'exercise capacity', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interstitial', 'lung injury', 'mange', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'palliate', 'palliation', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'protein biomarkers', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoking-related lung disease', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2019,170320,0.012729973825050983
"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record. The goal is to develop a low-risk, clinically validated method to estimate dynamic heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization.",Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting,9625645,K23HL135274,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Age-Years', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'San Francisco', 'Self Administration', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Theory of Change', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavior change', 'big biomedical data', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'digital', 'experience', 'functional status', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preempt', 'prevent', 'professor', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2019,203257,0.03998486233582003
"Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD Project Summary This NHLBI K01 application supports the career development of Dr. Nrupen A. Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data. In patients with diabetes at risk of cardiovascular disease events, I will examine the impact that missing data has on the ability to use the EHR for clinical research and develop approaches to address the biases resulting from missing data.",Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD,9742515,K01HL140146,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Baptist Church', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Quality', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Population Study', 'Privacy', 'Publishing', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'South Carolina', 'Stroke', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'care seeking', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'distributed data', 'electronic data', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'forest', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'practical application', 'professor', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'study population']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,165554,0.05713564037461674

Mentoring activities will build upon the ongoing involvement of Dr. Alonso in several training programs at Emory University, including an NHLBI-funded multidisciplinary T32 training grant on cardiovascular health disparities, the research-track Cardiology fellowship program at the School of Medicine, and the Master of Public Health and PhD programs in epidemiology at the Rollins School of Public Health. Training will focus on cutting-edge methodological areas in rapid development, including integration of omic technologies and machine learning in patient-oriented research, as well as acquisition of skills in academic, research, and clinical mentoring. Finally, this award will support a research project that extends Dr. Alonso's ongoing work on understanding the factors influencing the development of the AF substrate, understanding AF pathophysiology, and preventing AF-related outcomes. The specific aims of this research are: (1) to identify novel AF phenotypes (phenogroups) using extensive clinical and multi-omic data (“phenomapping”), (2) to discover specific risk factors for the different AF phenogroups, and (3) to determine associations of AF phenogroups with selected endpoints (stroke, heart failure, mortality). These research aims will be carried out in the context of the Emory Cardiovascular Biobank, an ongoing prospective registry of patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in three Emory-affiliated hospitals currently including approximately 7,000 unique individuals with detailed phenotyping, clinical outcomes, and multi-omic markers. In summary, the activities proposed in this application will favorably impact Dr. Alonso's capabilities to conduct cutting-edge and innovative patient-oriented research on cardiovascular prevention and his ability to perform as a highly qualified mentor for junior clinicians pursuing research on clinical cardiovascular epidemiology and prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite progress, atrial fibrillation, a common cardiac arrhythmia, remains a major public health program. This award will contribute to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of atrial fibrillation.

"Statistical methods for the assessment of social engagement in psychosis using digital technologies ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Linda Valeri, a biostatistician at McLean Hospital and the Harvard Medical School. Dr. Valeri is establishing herself as a young investigator in psychiatric biostatistics focusing on psychotic disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Valeri with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become expert in psychiatric biostatistics focusing on mobile health (mhealth) research for psychotic disorders (2) to conduct investigations using mhealth technologies in patients with psychosis; (3) to develop automated software for advanced machine learning methods in mhealth studies; and (4) to develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Valeri has assembled a team comprised of three mentors, Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness, and co-mentors Dr. Russell Schutt, Professor of Sociology at University of Massachusetts in Boston, who has extensive experience in the study of social interactions in patients with severe mental illness, and Dr. Jukka-Pekka Onnela, Associate Professor of Biostatistics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who has developed a platform for collection of raw sensor data from mobile devices, called “Beiwe”, and conducts research in the fields of digital phenotyping and network science. Dr. Valeri’s research will focus on the development of statistical methods for the analysis of mhealth data to shed light on the role of social engagement in psychosis. The proposal builds upon the hypothesis that social interactions captured by passive mobile data streams (call and text logs) and mobile surveys are potential targets of intervention and could lead to a sustained recovery by promoting perceived social support and improving psychiatric symptoms. In Aim 1(a) we propose to extend a machine learning approach, Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression, for the analysis of mobile data streams accounting for time- varying confounding. The approach will allow in Aim 1(b) to establish (i) reliable links between a high dimensional time series of passive measures of social and mobility behaviors with self-reported measures of social interaction and (ii) the effect of social interaction dynamics on perceived social support and psychiatric symptoms measured in clinical settings. Further, we will extend the approach to correct for selection bias introduced by missing data in mobile surveys (Aim 2). For both aims, Dr. Valeri will develop software (Aim 3) and apply the approaches to investigate these scientific questions using data from an ongoing study based at McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division that employs the smartphone platform for collection of sensor data developed by Dr. Onnela. Dr. Valeri’s investigation will provide preliminary evidence on features and timing of social interaction behaviors that can improve psychiatric symptoms along with understanding of potential mechanisms of action. This research will form the basis for an intervention study that encourages social interactions of patients with psychosis, to be proposed in a future R01 application. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Complex psychiatric diseases, such as chronic psychotic disorder, are major public health issues in the United States. The proposed research provides an innovative framework and develops powerful and computationally efficient statistical methods to integrate active (e.g. survey) and passive (e.g. GPS, text and call log) data streams from mobile sensors for the discovery of behavioral targets of treatment for chronic psychosis. By combining her expertise in biostatistics and causal inference with newly obtained knowledge of psychopathology of psychosis and of advanced machine learning methods, Dr. Valeri will acquire the necessary skill set and maturity to launch an independent research group. !",Statistical methods for the assessment of social engagement in psychosis using digital technologies,9786244,K01MH118477,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Boston', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Surveys', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Selection Bias', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Mobility', 'Social support', 'Sociology', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'career', 'data access', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'mobile computing', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'patient population', 'professor', 'psychiatric symptom', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social', 'social engagement', 'software development', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2019,141124,0.05884680670262462
"Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Zafar is a neurointensivist and clinical neurophysiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials using neurophysiologic tools, to improve outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries and seizures. Epileptiform abnormalities (seizures and seizure-like rhythmic patterns) are seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in up to 40% of acute brain injury patients and are associated with worse outcomes. Due to lack of evidence-based guidance, patients with epileptiform abnormalities are often aggressively treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), exposing them to AED related adverse effects that may worsen outcomes. Dr. Zafar's preliminary data shows that increasing burden of epileptiform abnormalities in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Up to half these patients receive AED treatment with no improvement in outcomes, and AED use itself is independently associated with worse outcomes. Dr. Zafar has built a comprehensive EEG database of 2000 patients to investigate AED effectiveness. In her career development plan, she will be using the rich neurophysiologic data in the EEG database, along with a nationwide dataset (Premier Healthcare Database) to study AED and EEG utilization patterns and AED effectiveness in a “real-clinical world” setting. Under the mentorship of Dr. M. Bradon Westover, and co-mentors (Dr. John Hsu, Dr. Elisabetta Patorno, and Dr. Hang Lee), Dr. Zafar proposes to: 1) Determine which specific epileptiform abnormalities show an acute response to AEDs by assessing neurological improvement within 24 hours of treatment (EEG database), 2) Assess the impact of AEDs on in- hospital clinical adverse outcomes and discharge functional outcomes in acute brain injury patients with epileptiform abnormalities (EEG database), 3) Investigate how AED-related adverse outcomes vary with practice patterns across hospitals with different resources and EEG utilization patterns (Premier Database). Dr. Zafar will perform a systematic exploration of the EEG database to determine EEG phenotypes associated with response to AED treatment, and determine the impact of AEDs on in-hospital adverse outcomes (e.g. mortality, hepatotoxicity, cardiac events). To account for national variation in AED prescription, hospital resources and EEG use, Dr. Zafar will examine adverse outcomes in the Premier Database. In addition to the proposed research, Dr. Zafar's career development plan includes a Masters of Science and coursework on analysis of large databases, pharmacoepidemiology and machine learning. Dr. Zafar will receive guidance from her mentors and advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow Dr. Zafar to establish a niche in using neurophysiologic data in comparative effectiveness research and launch an independent research career aimed at improving neurologic outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries. Project Narrative Although patients admitted with brain injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury are at high risk for developing seizures, physicians have very limited information to guide anti-epileptic drug management in such patients. This results in frequent overuse of anti-epileptic mediations that are also known to have harmful side effects. Dr. Zafar's proposed project will significantly advance our knowledge on which patients benefit the most from treatment and which patients are at highest risk for harmful side effects, providing guidance for physicians in making treatment decisions that will improve outcomes in the thousands of brain injury patients admitted to US hospitals each year.",Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury,9871037,K23NS114201,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Hospitals', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master of Science', 'Mediation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological Models', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Variant', 'active comparator', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative effectiveness', 'disorder subtype', 'effectiveness research', 'evidence base', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'side effect', 'skills', 'stroke patient', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2019,200880,0.0606496365684182
"Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity Cortical GABAergic interneurons are critical components of neural circuitry, and their dysfunction has been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases. Although the diversity of interneurons is not disputed, both the extent of their heterogeneity and the gene regulatory mechanisms that drive it remain unclear. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing technology have shed new light on this issue, enabling the prediction of novel interneuron subtypes based on gene expression. Cross-species meta-analysis would provide key insight into conserved mechanisms of interneuron diversity. However, cross-study integration remains a major challenge. I hypothesize that interneuron identity is defined by unifying molecular processes across species. This project is designed to reveal these processes by using an integrative, cross-species approach to explore the transcriptional, epigenetic, and developmental mechanisms that govern interneuron diversity. First, I have shown that mouse interneuron subtypes replicably express genes associated with cell-cell communication, enabling cross-dataset meta-analysis. The goal of Aim 1 is to use improved computational and phylogenetic methods to define homologous interneuron subtypes across species and identify robust gene targets. Second, preliminary investigation of single cell methylome-sequencing data indicates that it can be readily aligned with expression data. In Aim 2 I will use machine learning methods to generate networks from epigenomic and expression data and identify subtype-specific regulatory features. Third, I have shown that transcriptional profiles from developing neurons can be quantitatively assessed with respect to adult expression data. Aim 3 will use meta-analytic aggregation of temporal inference methods to enable cross-dataset comparisons and define conserved developmental gene programs. These studies will reveal a multidimensional portrait of interneuron molecular identity and enable genetic access to these cell types, a key aim of the BRAIN Initiative. I also propose an extensive training plan that will support my transition to independence. CSHL provides an outstanding research environment, with unequaled opportunities for scientific discussion, advanced skills training and career development. I have assembled an exceptional team of collaborators and mentors who will help me to achieve my goals.

Together, the proposed studies and professional training will ensure my successful transition to an independent position at a major university where I will lead a lab that will advance the goals of the BRAIN Initiative. Interneurons are key components of neural circuitry, acting as the cellular `brakes' that dampen neuronal activity. Although it has long been known that interneurons come in many different shapes and sizes, both the extent of this diversity and its consequences for brain function remain unclear. In this project, we propose that by combining information about the gene activity and epigenetic landscapes of interneurons across multiple species we will generate an integrated, multi-layered portrait of interneuron diversity which we can use to understand brain",Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity,9754408,K99MH120050,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Lateral Geniculate Body', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Portraits', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'career development', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'data integration', 'design', 'developmental neurobiology', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'methylome', 'neural circuit', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills training', 'student mentoring', 'symposium', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,K99,2019,118421,0.013626247562566064
"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics. The research proposed will apply novel strategies to further develop integrative machine learning analyses of multidimensional genomic data, discover clinically relevant predictive models, and create computational tools to accelerate future research.",Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models,9901758,R00HG009678,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Advisory Committees', 'Award', 'Bioconductor', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Budgets', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Coupling', 'CpG Island Methylator Phenotype', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yang', 'biomarker performance', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein metabolite', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'tenure track', 'tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R00,2019,249000,0.057946315449164655
"Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Strom received an MD from Harvard Medical School (HMS), and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (BIDMC), and non-invasive cardiac imaging (BIDMC). Additionally, he completed an MSc in Epidemiology program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in May, 2018. He is now a junior faculty member at BIDMC with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. Through this proposed 5-year program, Dr. Strom will pursue additional training in advanced prediction modeling, machine learning, patient-oriented research, and metabolomics. The candidate’s long- term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the area of applied outcomes research. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Robert W. Yeh (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, Robert E. Gerszten (Co-Mentor), Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at BIDMC, and Changyu Shen (Co-Mentor), upcoming Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Lead Biostatistician for the Smith Center. Dr. Yeh has a track record of leading practice-changing studies and successful mentorship of clinician investigators. Dr. Gerszten is an internationally recognized expert in molecular phenotyping of cardiovascular diseases using metabolomics and proteomics and has mentored several K-award and R01 funded clinical investigators. Dr. Shen has a long track record of NIH funding, expertise in evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect in cardiovascular diseases, and has mentored multiple prior trainees. Research: The optimal therapy for a given individual with aortic stenosis remains uncertain. This proposal seeks to define the clinical and biologic components of frailty that modify risk after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and alter treatment benefit. For Aims 1-2, we will leverage the unique linkage of Medicare data to the US CoreValve Pivotal trials, a collection of clinical trials that randomized individuals with severe aortic stenosis to transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis vs. surgical AVR (SAVR). In Aim 1, we will we will identify which variables, related to in-person assessments of frailty and candidate frailty codes, best predict adverse outcomes after AVR. In Aim 2, we will identify if novel variables identified in Aim 1, identify a heterogeneous treatment response in individuals undergoing AVR. In Aim 3, we will prospectively enroll patients undergoing TAVR at BIDMC with concurrent frailty phenotyping to identify whether metabolites associated with longevity correlate with frailty and predict adverse outcomes, independent of age and comorbidities. The research will identify the mechanisms by which frailty confers adverse risk and differential treatment benefit in AVR, providing insights that may personalize treatment selection and improve patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE While new technologies have permitted the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis, which is fatal without treatment, deciding on the optimal treatment for a given patient is often difficult, especially as these decisions are often made towards the end of life and there are significant risks concomitant with each treatment. In this setting, frailty, a state of debility that impairs recovery from illness, has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes but the mechanisms by which frailty confers risk and the components of frailty that are most important are unknown. In this proposal, we seek to define the clinical and biological components of frailty that contribute risk in aortic valve replacement using a combination of novel data sources and methodologic techniques, including linkage of clinical trials to administrative data, machine learning, and metabolite profiling, in order to personalize treatments and optimize patient health and medical decision making.",Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling,9821515,K23HL144907,"['Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioprosthesis device', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronology', 'Citric Acid Cycle', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Israel', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physician Executives', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve replacement', 'base', 'end of life', 'frailty', 'health data', 'health service use', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'mid-career faculty', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'surgical risk', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2019,172800,0.055763765892714444
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9733206,K23DK101687,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'serial imaging', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'translational impact', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2019,194368,0.09745856111719219
"Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Adel El Boueiz is a pulmonary and critical care physician-scientist completing a period of T32- funded support at the Channing Division of Network Medicine (CDNM) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He received a Master's of Medical Science in Biomedical Informatics from HMS in May 2016. He will be promoted to Instructor of Medicine at the CDNM and HMS on July 1, 2017. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in imaging phenotyping, genomics, and predictive analytics of the regional heterogeneity of the various aspects of COPD (emphysema, airway disease, and pulmonary vascular remodeling). Environment: Dr. El Boueiz will continue to pursue his research and career development in the rich and multidisciplinary environment of the CDNM and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Applied Chest Imaging Lab (ACIL). He will be mentored by Drs. Edwin K. Silverman, Peter J. Castaldi, and Raúl San José Estépar, leaders in the field of COPD quantitative imaging, genetic epidemiology, and predictive analytics with excellent track records of mentoring young investigators towards independent research careers. His career development will also be overseen by an advisory committee with expertise related to key areas of his proposal. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. COPD is a heterogeneous disease and this heterogeneity complicates the identification of the predictors of disease progression and consequently, the development of effective therapies. Emphysema distribution is an important COPD-related phenotype that emerged as a strong predictor of the response to lung volume reduction procedures. Despite the availability of advanced texture-based CT quantification methods, global threshold-based quantitative metrics have to date been the cornerstone for the radiological characterization of emphysema distribution with inability to differentiate centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema patterns. In this project, we will apply a texture-based CT quantification method to discover novel imaging biomarkers of the regional heterogeneity of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema in a large cohort of well-characterized smokers and identify their genetic determinants using whole genome sequencing and integrative genomics analyses. The results will be considered for inclusion along with other rich phenotypic and imaging data in COPD disease progression machine learning predictive models. Relevance: Through improved radiographic phenotyping of emphysema distribution, better understanding of disease pathobiology, and more accurate prediction of disease progression, the proposed work will open new avenues of investigation for the development of personalized and improved COPD therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that affects up to 24 million people in the United States, is associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality, and for which there is no available disease-modifying therapy. COPD is associated with significant variation in radiographic, symptomatic and physiologic presentation and exhibits variability in progression. Currently, there is no satisfactory method for progression prediction. This project will identify novel imaging biomarkers of the regional distribution of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema with particular emphasis on their associations with clinical relevant COPD-related outcomes, their genetic determinants, and their ability to improve prediction of COPD disease progression, above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. This is an important area of research as predicting those patients who will remain stable from those who will have rapid disease progression is critical in defining prognosis and selecting patients for specific therapeutic interventions.","Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers",9672582,K08HL141601,"['ACVR1B gene', 'Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Airway Disease', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Volume Reductions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'tomography', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2019,170639,0.01758224007147512
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months.

Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9747350,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'platelet function', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2019,199098,0.06273172323864432
"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE. PROJECT NARRATIVE This career development award will: a) Lead to the development and validation of a pediatric-specific Environmental Enteropathy (EE) Deep Learning Net for small intestinal structure which is urgently needed to standardize the diagnosis, care, and research of EE worldwide; b) Employ computational methods to correlate Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing morphological EE features with multiomic data to provide comprehensive diagnostic and predictive criteria for EE, and c) Validation of promising circulating biomarkers against intestinal biopsies, the diagnostic gold standard for enteropathies. Successful completion of this work will channel our improved understanding of the gut's critical role in childhood stunting pathways towards effective interventions to improve nutrition and health in at risk populations.",Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy,9666310,K23DK117061,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antigens', 'Asia', 'Bangladeshi', 'Bile Acids', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Celiac Disease', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diet', 'Duodenum', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gluten', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human Pathology', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Impairment', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Intestinal permeability', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lactulose', 'Lamina Propria', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lymphocytosis', 'MS4A1 gene', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Milieu Therapy', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Multiomic Data', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Pakistan', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevalence', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rhamnose', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Villous', 'Virginia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'absorption', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'disorder control', 'effective intervention', 'effective therapy', 'enteric pathogen', 'imaging approach', 'immunogenicity', 'improved', 'intraepithelial', 'low and middle-income countries', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrition', 'oral vaccine', 'patient oriented', 'socioeconomics', 'transcriptome', 'urinary']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,K23,2019,194052,0.004752772640670243
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,9723205,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2019,186155,0.11383759048319443
"Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary This National Research Service Award (F32) is designed to promote the development of Stephanie Goldstein as an independent, clinical research scientist focused on developing and evaluating strategies for measuring and intervening on health behaviors that capitalize on digital health technology. Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and health benefits for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes and most experience gradual weight regain, thus negating the benefits over time. Lapses (i.e., self- reported eating instances that deviate from the BOT prescribed diet) could explain poor outcomes, but the behavior is understudied because it is difficult to assess in-lab and via self-report. We therefore propose to study lapses using a multimethod approach with the following tools: ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device), a wrist-worn device that automatically detects eating behavior and various eating characteristics (frequency, rate, and duration of eating episodes), and 24-hour dietary recalls. We will recruit participants (n=40) with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor to enroll in a 12-week BOT program and follow them through an additional 12-week period of weight loss maintenance. Participants will complete a biweekly 7-day EMA protocol to self-report on eating behavior, including the occurrence of dietary lapse. Participants will continuously wear the wrist-worn ActiGraph Link to characterize eating behavior. Lastly, participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls via structured interview (split between days with and without lapses) at 6-week intervals to measure the composition of all food and beverages consumed. The proposed study approach is consistent with priorities of NHLBI to optimize clinical research and diagnostic strategies to improve CVD and related risk factors. This project will be conducted in combination with an individualized training program including a curriculum designed to facilitate the acquisition of key skills and experience to move the applicant towards her career goals. This includes didactic and experiential training related to the use of passive sensing technology and related analytic strategies in research, factors that can impede weight maintenance and dietary adherence in BOT, and administration and interpretation of validated nutritional assessment. The applicant will work closely with her primary sponsor, Dr. J. Graham Thomas, her co-sponsors Dr. Rena Wing (renowned expert in weight maintenance), Dr. Adam Hoover (electrical and computer scientist), and Dr. Whitney Evans (nutritional epidemiologist and registered dietician). This mentorship team, in combination with the infrastructure and resources available through the Miriam Hospital Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center and Alpert Brown Medical School, represent the ideal environment to accomplish the applicant's training goals, foster professional development and increase the applicant's autonomy as an independent clinical obesity researcher. Project Narrative The current project is evaluating the utility of a wrist-worn passive sensing device for detecting dietary lapses (i.e., discrete eating instances that deviate from a prescribed diet) and evaluating the behavior's association with weight loss outcomes. Participants, with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor, will wear wrist-worn devices, complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device) on dietary lapses, and provide information on dietary composition via semi-regular 24-hour food recalls throughout the duration of a 12-week behavioral weight loss program and 12-week weight maintenance period. This study aims to 1) identifying characteristics of lapse behavior by measuring passively-sensed timing, duration, frequency, and rate of eating amongst known lapse episodes, 2) test the association between dietary lapse frequency and weight change, and 3) estimate nutrition composition of dietary lapses.",Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9771304,F32HL143954,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Beverages', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary intake', 'Dietetics', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Energy Intake', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Healthy Eating', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Wing', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'adaptive intervention', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'dietary adherence', 'digital', 'experience', 'falls', 'food consumption', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity treatment', 'prevent', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'sleep pattern', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment program', 'weight loss program', 'weight maintenance', 'willingness']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,F32,2019,60552,0.00904402881075442
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9689119,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rice', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'structural genomics', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2019,423432,0.03368676261546591
"Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract The applicant Udo Hoffmann MD MPH is a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and the Chief of the Division for Cardiovascular Imaging in the Department of Radiology at MGH. Dr. Hoffmann has established a patient oriented research (POR) program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research methods to demonstrate the value of advanced cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Hoffmann has published approximately 380 peer reviewed papers, among them many in premier medical journals and has received continued independent, peer-reviewed POR NIH funding since 2005. He is among the very few faculty members at Harvard Medical School who are both the PI and Director of a highly successful NHLBI funded T- 32 program (Cardiac MR and CT Research) and a recipient of a K24. Dr. Hoffmann has successfully mentored more than 60 clinical investigators, most of which currently hold faculty positions in major academic centers and actively perform POR. Moreover, Dr. Hoffmann has successfully accomplished all mentoring and scientific goals of the first K24 award period. Overall, these achievements document Dr. Hoffmann's long standing passion and commitment to POR. His excellent publication, funding, and mentoring record together with his current and planned research support provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the aims of this competitive renewal of the K24 Award “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. Dr. Hoffmann proposes a mentoring and research plan that utilizes the synergies of past, ongoing, and future highly innovative independent research projects with educational and training opportunities offered by the cardiac MR CT PET Program, the T32 training program in cardiovascular imaging, the Harvard CTSA, and the Harvard School of Public Health. The specific aims addressing the charge of the K24 Award are to enable Dr. Hoffmann to: 1) dedicate 25% of his time to mentor clinical investigators based on NIH or equivalent funded projects in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”, 2) to mentor junior and mid-career clinical investigators with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants, and 3) to continue to expand a POR program that combines translational, clinical, and outcomes research to develop future leaders in clinical research in cardiovascular imaging and beyond. The research plan encompasses four specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of statin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis in HIV patients in 800 patients with HIV randomized to statin therapy vs. placebo, 2) To determine whether high risk coronary plaque predicts cardiovascular events in 4600 patients with clinical suspicion of CAD, 3) To determine the cost effectiveness of CT FFR in patients with stable and acute chest pain, and 4) To use Radiomics to identify novel imaging markers predicting cardiovascular events in participants of the Framingham Heart Study. Narrative This research takes advantage of a rich body of independent funded research in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”.

"Associating retinal nerve fiber layer thickness with glucose metabolism and diabetic retinopathy Project Summary/Abstract Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a metabolic disease that affects over 300 million people worldwide and that can be accompanied by serious health complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, stroke, and damage to the eyes, in particular diabetic retinopathy (DR), which is diagnosed in a third of people with diabetes and which is the leading cause of blindness within the age group between 20 and 64 years. T2DM is clinically diagnosed by parameters related to glucose metabolism obtained by blood tests. Due to its long pre- symptomatic phase, an estimate of 25% of diabetics in the US are undiagnosed. In this project, the relationship between spatial patterns of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (RNFLT), measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), and blood test levels as well as levels of DR severity is investigated in 9,261 participants of a population based study.  In a first step, OCT RNFLT measurements of the macular and the circumpapillary area around optic nerve head are segmented into spatial sectors, and representative spatial patterns of RNFLT are calculated by an unsupervised machine learning method. Afterwards, a multivariate linear model comparison is performed with the coefficients of the spatial RNFLT patterns as regressors and diagnostic blood test results as dependent variable. The optimal combination of the RNFLT patterns, determined by an established model selection criterion (Bayes Factor), is expected to reveal insight into the association between the specific retinal locations of RNFL thinning accompanying the change in parameters related glucose metabolism during the development and progression of T2DM. Furthermore, fundus images are graded by DR severity following a nine-step scale derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study from no DR to severe proliferative DR. The spatial RNFLT patterns and metabolic blood test scores are then compared with respect to modeling DR severity by linear regression. An optimal model of DR severity combining glucose metabolism parameters and RNFLT patterns is developed. Finally, in an analogous procedure, DR severity of the follow-up measurement, five years after baseline, is statistically predicted from RNFLT and metabolic blood parameters and from their change over time.  To summarize, the proposed research identifies spatial patterns of RNFLT associated with parameters of glucose metabolism and their development over DR severity. Once accomplished, the proposed project would provide the details to establish RNFLT as an alternative manifestation of T2DM that complements diagnostic blood tests and thereby, for instance, lay the foundations for the development of novel and more accurate T2DM progression monitoring or the prediction of the onset of DR. Project Narrative Parameters related to glucose metabolism obtained by blood tests are clinically used to diagnose diabetes, a metabolic disease that affects over 300 million people worldwide and that can be accompanied by serious health complications, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of blindness within the age group between 20 and 64 years. Decreased levels of blood glucose tolerance have been associated with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning, but these results were based on comparisons between small populations of diagnosed diabetics and healthy controls, and RNFL was typically represented by coarse summary parameters which neglect retinal anatomy. This project contributes directly and immediately to public health by exploring the relationship between spatial patterns of RNFL thickness, present and future DR severity, and diagnostic blood test results in 9,261 participants of a population based study, with the final goal to establish and quantify RNFL thickness as an alternative manifestation of diabetes that complements diagnostic blood tests and lays the foundations for the development of novel and more accurate disease progression monitoring or the prediction of DR onset.",Associating retinal nerve fiber layer thickness with glucose metabolism and diabetic retinopathy,9809589,R21EY030631,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Tests', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'OGTT', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Validation', 'age group', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diabetic', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'follow-up', 'fundus imaging', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose tolerance', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'macula', 'neglect', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'public health relevance', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,SCHEPENS EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2019,313837,0.07252956874945907
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9785527,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2019,192917,0.08438376168246324
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach ABSTRACT The etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) likely involves a complex interaction of polygenic, metabolic, and environmental factors including diet. Accumulating experimental, epidemiological, and clinical evidence supports a pathogenic role of chronic inflammation in T2D development. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these findings are largely unknown, and current evidence on the causal relationships between specific inflammatory pathways and T2D risk is inconclusive. Advances in omics technologies have led to the identification of genes and metabolites associated with T2D risk, but data on mechanisms and causality are still very limited. Multi-omics integration in the framework of systems epidemiology may provide new avenues to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms. To systematically investigate the relation between chronic inflammation and T2D, I propose to examine 3 Specific Aims by leveraging the rich resources in the UK Biobank, Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS), Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SOL), and Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx). In Aim 1 [K99], I will integrate existing genomic data from the UK Biobank, NHS/HPFS, SOL, and transcriptomic data in the GTEx to examine shared genetic architectures between systemic inflammatory markers and T2D and whether polygenic susceptibility to chronic inflammation confers T2D risk. Meanwhile, I will receive extensive training in T2D systems biology and cutting-edge high-dimensional data analytics and bioinformatics. In Aim 2 [R00], I will integrate dietary and metabolomic data to examine metabolomic profiles mediating the association between dietary inflammatory potentials and T2D risk in the prospective NHS/HPFS and the SOL. In Aim 3 [R00], I will conduct plasma proteomic profiling in a nested case-control study within the NHS to identify inflammatory protein networks in relation to T2D risk, and as a Secondary Aim, integrate findings from Aim 1-3 to explore T2D-related pathways co-regulating at multiple biological dimensions. Findings from this project may improve the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms underlying T2D and identify novel targets/pathways suitable for early detection and prevention. I will be mentored/advised by an interdisciplinary team that includes Dr. JoAnn Manson (diabetes epidemiologist), Dr. Liming Liang (expert in statistical omics methodologies), Dr. Frank Hu (nutritional epidemiologist), Dr. Peter Kraft, (statistical geneticist), Dr. Qibin Qi (genetic epidemiologist), Dr. Towia Libermann (expert in proteomics), and Dr. Clary Clish (expert in metabolomics). The outstanding training opportunities with key leaders in these areas will provide me advanced knowledge and skills, positioning me for a successful, independent career as a diabetes epidemiologist with expertise in systems biology and integrated-omics. This project aligns with the NIDDK’s goal of integrating multi-omics technologies into diabetes research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to systematically examine the relationship between chronic inflammation and type 2 diabetes (T2D) by incorporating multi-omics data from several large prospective cohort studies. The proposed research will yield novel evidence on the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between chronic inflammation and T2D risk. Novel pathways, and specific genes, proteins, and metabolites identified in this research will serve as the critical first steps for future development of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for T2D prevention and treatment.",Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach,9805982,K99DK122128,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Food', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos', 'IL6 gene', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Interleukin-6', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Nutritional', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Study of Latinos', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Technology', 'Training', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'Work', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'diabetes risk', 'disorder prevention', 'genetic architecture', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'response', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2019,91499,0.03932546609177207

In addition, she will receive formal training in evolutionary biology, Bayesian and mixed-model biostatistics, computer science, leadership skills and grant writing. The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9747894,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'pathogen genomics', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2019,215352,0.07575555922879708
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial. This proposal responds to the AHRQ priorities of improving health care quality through use of information systems, improving safety and quality of care by synthesizing and communicating evidence to health care professionals, advances knowledge generation in a learning health system and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs.",Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED),9747879,K08HS025696,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K08,2019,148539,0.020609543623986544
"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,9682500,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Blood Pressure', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2019,172137,0.06766076064981752
"Optimizing measurement of mindfulness meditation using brain pattern classification. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  	The candidate Dr. Helen Weng is seeking a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award for her immediate career goal to gain mentorship and training to develop the EMBODY Task, a more objective and precise fMRI measure of meditation practice that uses multivariate brain pattern classification methods. Dr. Weng earned her doctorate in clinical psychology researching the neurobiological mechanisms of compassion meditation with Dr. Richard Davidson, an expert in contemplative neuroscience. She is currently a postdoctoral scholar at the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine (OCIM) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in a NCCIH T32-funded fellowship, where she is studying mindful body awareness using neuroscientific and psychophysiological methods. Dr. Weng is rigorously trained in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study contemplative neuroscience; however, she is primarily trained in using standard univariate analyses, which collapse across spatial and temporal information within fMRI data. She recognized the potential limitations of these methods to study the complex and fluctuating mental states that occur during meditation practice, and aims to develop novel fMRI tasks that use multivariate methods (which utilize spatial and temporal variability within fMRI data) to study brain states trained by meditation. Obtaining this K08 to develop the EMBODY Task would support Dr. Weng’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator of the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic benefits of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). 	Dr. Weng’s career development plan includes training in the cognitive neuroscience of attention, fMRI pattern classification, and clinical trial methods to study meditation training. Dr. Weng has assembled a stellar mentoring team including top experts in cognitive neuroscience, mindfulness-based interventions, and pattern classification. Her primary sponsor and mentor, Dr. Adam Gazzaley (Director of the UCSF Neuroscience Imaging Center), is a world-class expert in the cognitive neuroscience of attention and neuroplasticity induced by app-based trainings. Her co-mentor, Dr. Rick Hecht (Research Director at OCIM) is a leading expert in clinical trials of MBIs. Her team also includes experts in fMRI pattern classification methodology (Dr. Bin Yu, Chancellor’s Professor, UC Berkeley; Dr. Melina Uncapher, UCSF) and cognitive neuroscience of internal attention (Dr. David Ziegler, UCSF). Dr. Weng’s training environment is at UCSF, a top NIH-funded research institution, and she will have access to state-of-the-art neuroimaging facilities at the Neuroscience Imaging Center and resources from OCIM, a flagship center for studying meditation. She will regularly meet and communicate with her mentorship team, and complete coursework, fMRI workshops, and training programs to fulfill her training goals. Dr. Weng’s K08 research proposal aims to develop the EMBODY Task, a novel fMRI task that uses brain pattern classification to decode the focus of attention during a period of breath meditation. This task will more accurately measure mental states during meditation by using precise information from individuals’ unique neural signatures. The task will distinguish neural patterns associated with attention (breath attention) and inattention (mind wandering) to the breath, and use these patterns to identify fluctuating brain states during ten minutes of breath meditation. This will produce objective brain-derived metrics of breath attention such as percentage time spent in breath attention, which can then be used to objectively assess outcomes of meditation training. She will pilot, develop, and validate this task within long-term practitioners, meditation novices, and a separate group of novices who go through mobile app-based meditation training. Dr. Weng will use this data to prepare a future R61/R33 proposal that will use the EMBODY Task to more rigorously test the mechanisms of action of how mindfulness-based interventions improve clinical outcomes by training meditation skills. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic pain is an enormous public health issue that affects 100 million Americans and costs more than $600 billion per year in treatments and lost productivity; and major depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States (6.7% prevalence in 2014) and carries the heaviest burden of disability among mental disorders (World Health Organization, 2010). Mindfulness-Based Interventions improve symptoms in chronic pain and depression; however, we do not currently understand what meditation skills learned from mindfulness-based interventions improve symptoms in chronic pain and depression, and this information is needed to improve treatment. This proposal will develop a more accurate and precise measure of meditation practice using brain imaging methods (functional MRI) that can identify attention states during meditation practice.",Optimizing measurement of mindfulness meditation using brain pattern classification.,9625081,K08AT009385,"['Affect', 'American', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Body measure procedure', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Compassion', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insula of Reil', 'Integrative Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Meditation', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'career', 'career development', 'chronic depression', 'chronic pain', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cost', 'design', 'disability burden', 'health training', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'inattention', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental representation', 'mental state', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mindfulness meditation', 'mobile application', 'neural patterning', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'professor', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'symptomatic improvement']",NCCIH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K08,2019,195853,0.05709885313527127
"Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Candace Feldman is an Instructor in Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy and the Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). Dr. Feldman has a longstanding passion to understand and reduce disparities in rheumatic diseases. Her research focuses on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in prevalence, access and outcomes among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Her 14 peer-reviewed original publications, 8 first author, and 2 early career development grants exemplify her track record and her commitment to this field. She holds a MPH degree and is pursuing a doctorate in social epidemiology from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her immediate goals are to learn and apply advanced health services research and qualitative methods to understand SLE-related avoidable acute care use to inform a future intervention. She will be guided by Dr. Costenbader, an established SLE epidemiologist, and an expert mentoring team. Dr. Feldman strives to apply rigorous methods to redesign healthcare delivery for vulnerable rheumatology patients. Environment: Dr. Feldman’s Division Chief ensures that >75% of her time will be protected for research and career development for the 5-year duration of this K23 award. She has financial support to supplement her salary and project-related expenses from the Division, the SCS, and her primary mentor’s funding. The BWH Lupus Center, co-directed by Dr. Costenbader, is the largest in New England. The research infrastructure established as part of the Center will enable Dr. Feldman to recruit patients.

For her training, she will have access to courses and mentorship at HSPH, where she is a doctoral student, and through Harvard Medical School and the Harvard Catalyst Program. Research: Dr. Feldman will rigorously define SLE-related conditions that may result in avoidable acute care use (e.g. emergency department visits and hospitalizations). She will then examine rates and predictors of potentially avoidable use, and associated mortality and costs in two large, diverse datasets. She will learn and apply qualitative methods, including Photovoice, which will empower SLE patients to photograph their homes and communities, to explore the contribution of social determinants to avoidable care use. Dr. Feldman will hold focus groups of SLE patients, providers and administrators to design a rheumatology-based intervention to improve healthcare delivery for these high-utilizing, vulnerable SLE patients. Dr. Feldman will develop skills in rigorous mixed methods research. This project, and the training Dr. Feldman will gain, will position her for a R01 and for a career as an independent social epidemiology and patient-oriented investigator in rheumatology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lupus is a complex autoimmune disease, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and resulting in high acute care use, much of which could be prevented if patients had consistent access to high-quality outpatient care. There is a need to define and understand lupus-specific avoidable acute care use (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) and to identify those patients at highest risk.

"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,9626867,K08AI125682,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Sterility', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Target Populations', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malaria transmission', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parasite invasion', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'professor', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'surveillance data', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K08,2019,185224,0.02989905402695118
"Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting Project Summary/Abstract Background and Candidate: Children with orofacial clefting present with increased rate of dental anomalies in shape, size, number, symmetry, abnormal eruption and malposition of teeth both inside and outside the cleft area, leading to dental problems and reduction of quality of life. Although the scientific community has recognized these findings for a long time, the specific etiological factors underlying such anomalies still remain elusive. An important step to understanding etiology is via careful phenotypic approaches that can detect the co-occurrence of such anomalies in discernable patterns that can simplify the identification of risk factors. Dr. Brian Howe is a Clinical Assistant Professor at the College of Dentistry of the University of Iowa. His primary research focus is on the identification and characterization of oral phenotypes in an effort to identify etiological factors underlying the oral phenotypic spectrum of nonsyndromic orofacial clefting. Career Goals: Dr. Howe's short term goals are to deepen is knowledge of complex craniofacial phenotypes and expand his current understanding of craniofacial development. His long term goals are to become a funded independent researcher and a leading clinician and educator in the field of craniofacial phenomics and dentistry as a tenure track faculty at a University of Iowa. His research plan is innovative in that it leverages unique bioinformatics algorithms to identify complex oral phenotypic patterns amenable for studies of risk factors and causality. Environment: The University of Iowa has an established reputation for the successful training of graduate and postdoctoral students in research and clinical areas. It offers learning and development seminars focused on career development and advancement with particular benefits from training opportunities from its Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS). Career Development Plan: Dr. Howe is committed to attend courses, tutorials, seminars and relevant conferences as well as meeting regularly with his mentors, collaborators, and advisory committee to fulfill is training aims and gain the knowledge necessary to achieve his future research goals and become an independent clinical researcher. Research Study: This research aims to identify oral phenotypic patterns in orofacial clefting using modern and traditional pattern mining methods in a diverse international population with existing environmental and genetic variables. This knowledge will have key implications in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting as well as driving the implementation of innovative treatment approaches to improve dental outcomes and future preventive strategies. Project Narrative  Individuals with nonsyndromic orofacial clefting present with a wide range of dental anomalies leading to more intricate oral rehabilitation procedures which increases dental morbidity and reduces quality of life in those affected. In the largest international cohort of families with orofacial clefting and controls to date, this project will utilize pattern mining approaches to detect the co-occurrence of particular dental anomalies in discernable patterns that will likely simplify the search for the etiological factors underlying these anomalies. This research will aid in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting by expanding and further defining oral phenotypes which will drive biologically meaningful strategies for the identification of genetic risk factors as well as helping to improve clinical care.",Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting,9743788,K08DE028012,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Enamel', 'Dental crowns', 'Dentistry', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Maxilla', 'Mentors', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Odontogenesis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pierre Robin Syndrome', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Dentition', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tooth Germ', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vascular blood supply', 'analytical tool', 'calcification', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'college', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial complex', 'craniofacial development', 'design', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'novel', 'orofacial cleft', 'palatogenesis', 'permanent tooth', 'phenomics', 'professor', 'programs', 'repaired', 'research study', 'risk variant', 'symposium', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'trend']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2019,12553,0.03362539539457042
"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9747912,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'risk prediction model', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2019,168896,0.019725075357328883
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly. This project will develop automated tools to increase measurement throughput, and explore new image-based biomarkers that will significantly add to the assessment of patient prognosis, and will have the ability to more quickly judge the effectiveness of interventions.",Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD,9782929,K01DK110136,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'FarGo', 'Fibrosis', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Tissue', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Spin Labels', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'educational atmosphere', 'functional decline', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'kidney vascular structure', 'knowledge base', 'novel imaging technology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'prognostic value', 'radiological imaging', 'renal artery', 'research study', 'shear stress', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K01,2019,154915,0.029930295322296886
"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers. One emerging target for research involves using functional MRI to study brain systems that contribute to risk. This project will explore the neural correlates of positive and negative valence emotional processing and how they contribute to risk for the development of alcohol use disorders. Better understanding of these neural processes could inform us about how alcohol use disorders emerge and, importantly, how we might prevent them.",Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism,9772202,R00AA024778,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcoholism', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Extramural Activities', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Loudness', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Review Literature', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Targeted Research', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'aged', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'faculty research', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'negative affect', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'predicting response', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'underage drinking']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2019,249000,-0.014520883918956388
"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder.

"Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess and Train Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis during Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CANDIDATE (Andrew J. Hung, MD): My long-term goal is to establish a career in innovating training methods for robotic surgery which will lead to curtailing surgeon learning curve, and maximize patient safety. My first step towards that goal focuses on understanding objective metrics that measure surgeon performance, and how machine learning algorithms can process that data to guide training. I have developed a career development program that builds on my clinical training in robotic urologic surgery and prior research in surgical training. Through mentorship, a fellowship, and formal coursework, this K23 award will provide me the necessary support to develop expertise in 3 areas where I do not have formal training, yet are critical to my success: (1) Machine learning; (2) Surgical education; (3) Advanced statistical skills and study design. MENTORING TEAM: My career development and research plans leverage existing institutional resources, including the USC Machine Learning Center, led by co-primary mentor Dr. Yan Liu; and Keck Hospital of USC, the second busiest robotic center by volume in the United States and the USC Institute of Urology (led by co- primary mentor and chairman Dr. Inderbir Gill), home to pioneers of several urologic surgical techniques with a robust research apparatus supporting several NIH-funded clinical scientists. My mentoring team is complemented by co-mentor Dr. Robert Sweet, a DOD-funded expert on surgical education; career mentor Dr. Larissa Rodriguez, a federally funded clinician/scientist experienced in mentoring K awardees; educational psychology collaborator Dr. Kenneth Yates, an authority on cognitive task analysis; and consultant Dr. Anthony Jarc, at Intuitive Surgical who has supported much of the pilot data on objective performance metrics. The proposed K23 work truly requires the robust collaboration of experts in robotic surgery, education, and machine learning. RESEARCH: The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is steep: over 100 cases. Current ‘gold standard’ methods of surgical assessment rely on subjective expert review, but such evaluations are time consuming and inconsistent. Nonetheless, credentialing a surgeon to perform robotic surgery has enormous implications - patient outcomes are at risk, and a surgeon’s career is on the line. Informed by my clinical expertise in robotic urological surgery and preliminary data, I will develop a novel method of utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms to objectively assess robotic surgeon performance and to guide training for the vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA), the most critical reconstructive part of the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). I will develop and validate objective metrics directly captured from the da Vinci robot during the VUA (Aim 1), train machine learning algorithms to assess a surgeon’s performance of VUA (Aim 2), and utilize ML algorithms to guide surgeons learning the VUA (Aim 3). Armed with these data and skills from this award, I will be uniquely suited to utilize machine learning to generalize objective surgeon assessment for robot-assisted surgical procedures within and beyond urology. Finally, the results from this study will provide preliminary data for independent funding through mechanisms such as an NIH R01 grant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer is steep, and current methods of evaluating surgeons require subjective and time-consuming expert review. Streamlined training and assessment utilizing objective performance metrics and machine learning algorithms can significantly curtail learning curve with patients, and decrease the overall morbidity of prostate cancer treatment.",Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess and Train Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis during Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy,9581712,K23EB026493,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Chairperson', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Credentialing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational Psychology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Specialist', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urethra', 'Urologic Surgical Procedures', 'Urology', 'Work', 'authority', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive task', 'common treatment', 'computer program', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'feeding', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'male', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'peer', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'robot assistance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'task analysis', 'urologic', 'virtual reality']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K23,2018,193846,0.0737958782842866
"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record. The goal is to develop a low-risk, clinically validated method to estimate dynamic heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization.",Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting,9452770,K23HL135274,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Age-Years', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'San Francisco', 'Self-Administered', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Theory of Change', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'base', 'behavior change', 'big biomedical data', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'digital', 'experience', 'functional status', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preempt', 'prevent', 'professor', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2018,203540,0.03998486233582003
"Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD Project Summary This NHLBI K01 application supports the career development of Dr. Nrupen A. Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data.

"Statistical methods for the assessment of social engagement in psychosis using digital technologies ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Linda Valeri, a biostatistician at McLean Hospital and the Harvard Medical School. Dr. Valeri is establishing herself as a young investigator in psychiatric biostatistics focusing on psychotic disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Valeri with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become expert in psychiatric biostatistics focusing on mobile health (mhealth) research for psychotic disorders (2) to conduct investigations using mhealth technologies in patients with psychosis; (3) to develop automated software for advanced machine learning methods in mhealth studies; and (4) to develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Valeri has assembled a team comprised of three mentors, Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness, and co-mentors Dr. Russell Schutt, Professor of Sociology at University of Massachusetts in Boston, who has extensive experience in the study of social interactions in patients with severe mental illness, and Dr. Jukka-Pekka Onnela, Associate Professor of Biostatistics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who has developed a platform for collection of raw sensor data from mobile devices, called “Beiwe”, and conducts research in the fields of digital phenotyping and network science. Dr. Valeri’s research will focus on the development of statistical methods for the analysis of mhealth data to shed light on the role of social engagement in psychosis. The proposal builds upon the hypothesis that social interactions captured by passive mobile data streams (call and text logs) and mobile surveys are potential targets of intervention and could lead to a sustained recovery by promoting perceived social support and improving psychiatric symptoms. In Aim 1(a) we propose to extend a machine learning approach, Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression, for the analysis of mobile data streams accounting for time- varying confounding. The approach will allow in Aim 1(b) to establish (i) reliable links between a high dimensional time series of passive measures of social and mobility behaviors with self-reported measures of social interaction and (ii) the effect of social interaction dynamics on perceived social support and psychiatric symptoms measured in clinical settings. Further, we will extend the approach to correct for selection bias introduced by missing data in mobile surveys (Aim 2). For both aims, Dr. Valeri will develop software (Aim 3) and apply the approaches to investigate these scientific questions using data from an ongoing study based at McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division that employs the smartphone platform for collection of sensor data developed by Dr. Onnela. Dr. Valeri’s investigation will provide preliminary evidence on features and timing of social interaction behaviors that can improve psychiatric symptoms along with understanding of potential mechanisms of action. This research will form the basis for an intervention study that encourages social interactions of patients with psychosis, to be proposed in a future R01 application. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Complex psychiatric diseases, such as chronic psychotic disorder, are major public health issues in the United States. The proposed research provides an innovative framework and develops powerful and computationally efficient statistical methods to integrate active (e.g. survey) and passive (e.g. GPS, text and call log) data streams from mobile sensors for the discovery of behavioral targets of treatment for chronic psychosis. By combining her expertise in biostatistics and causal inference with newly obtained knowledge of psychopathology of psychosis and of advanced machine learning methods, Dr. Valeri will acquire the necessary skill set and maturity to launch an independent research group. !",Statistical methods for the assessment of social engagement in psychosis using digital technologies,9647045,K01MH118477,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Boston', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Surveys', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Selection Bias', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Mobility', 'Social support', 'Sociology', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'career', 'data access', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'mobile computing', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'patient population', 'professor', 'psychiatric symptom', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social', 'social engagement', 'software development', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2018,137992,0.05884680670262462
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,9393346,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency research', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care outcomes', 'career', 'clinical implementation', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2018,163944,0.023393199504497864
"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics. The research proposed will apply novel strategies to further develop integrative machine learning analyses of multidimensional genomic data, discover clinically relevant predictive models, and create computational tools to accelerate future research.",Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models,9526698,K99HG009678,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Advisory Committees', 'Award', 'Bioconductor', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Budgets', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Coupling', 'CpG Island Methylator Phenotype', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yang', 'biomarker performance', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein metabolite', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'tenure track', 'tool']",NHGRI,HUDSON-ALPHA INSTITUTE FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY,K99,2018,112117,0.057946315449164655
"Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy Abstract  In this SBIR project, we present EyeMark, a set of advanced image analysis tools for automated computation of biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy (DR) using retinal fundus images. Specifically, we will develop tools for computation of microaneurysm (MA) ap- pearance and disappearance rates (jointly known as turnover rates) for use as a bi- omarker in quantifying DR progression risk along with longitudinal analysis of other DR lesions. The availability of a reliable image-based biomarker will have high positive influ- ence on various aspects of DR care, including screening, monitoring progression, drug discovery and clinical research.  Measuring MA turnover and longitudinal analysis of DR lesions involves two labor in- tensive steps: careful alignment of current and baseline images, and marking of individual lesions. This process is very time consuming and prone to error, if done entirely by human graders. The primary goal of this project is to overcome these limitations by automating both the steps involved in longitudinal analysis: accurate image registration, and lesion identification.  We have designed and developed a MA turnover computation prototype tool that ro- bustly registers longitudinal images (even with multiple lesion changes) and effectively detects DR lesions (lesion level AUROC>=0.95). The tool provides graceful degradation to confounding image factors by reporting MA turnover as a range, thereby capturing the inherent confidence in MA detection. By the end of Phase IIB we will develop a market ready, clinically validated end-to-end desktop software for robust, automated longitudinal lesion analysis and characterization that can work on the cloud to produce results in near constant time (for large datasets), and also provide intuitive visualization tools for clinicians to more effectively monitor DR progression. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeMark, will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients by providing an automated tool for computation of an image- based, reliable, DR biomarker in a non-invasive manner. This will enable identification of patients who are at higher risk to progress to severe retinopathy, thus helping prevent vision loss in such patients by timely intervention. Early identification is especially important in face of long backlog of diabetic patients waiting for an eye examination, and the fact that 90% of vision loss can be saved by early identification. The availability of an effective biomarker will also positively influence the drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable determination of biological efficacy of potential new therapies.",Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy,9622980,R44TR000377,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Services', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Microaneurysm', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pear', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'ROC Curve', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'digital imaging', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fundus imaging', 'high risk', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'improved', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'macula', 'medical schools', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'response', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'screening program', 'success', 'tool', 'usability', 'validation studies']",NCATS,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2018,750000,0.04210126795750722
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9513528,K23DK101687,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'translational impact', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2018,194368,0.09745856111719219
"Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Adel El Boueiz is a pulmonary and critical care physician-scientist completing a period of T32- funded support at the Channing Division of Network Medicine (CDNM) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He received a Master's of Medical Science in Biomedical Informatics from HMS in May 2016. He will be promoted to Instructor of Medicine at the CDNM and HMS on July 1, 2017. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in imaging phenotyping, genomics, and predictive analytics of the regional heterogeneity of the various aspects of COPD (emphysema, airway disease, and pulmonary vascular remodeling). Environment: Dr. El Boueiz will continue to pursue his research and career development in the rich and multidisciplinary environment of the CDNM and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Applied Chest Imaging Lab (ACIL). He will be mentored by Drs. Edwin K. Silverman, Peter J. Castaldi, and Raúl San José Estépar, leaders in the field of COPD quantitative imaging, genetic epidemiology, and predictive analytics with excellent track records of mentoring young investigators towards independent research careers. His career development will also be overseen by an advisory committee with expertise related to key areas of his proposal. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. COPD is a heterogeneous disease and this heterogeneity complicates the identification of the predictors of disease progression and consequently, the development of effective therapies. Emphysema distribution is an important COPD-related phenotype that emerged as a strong predictor of the response to lung volume reduction procedures. Despite the availability of advanced texture-based CT quantification methods, global threshold-based quantitative metrics have to date been the cornerstone for the radiological characterization of emphysema distribution with inability to differentiate centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema patterns. In this project, we will apply a texture-based CT quantification method to discover novel imaging biomarkers of the regional heterogeneity of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema in a large cohort of well-characterized smokers and identify their genetic determinants using whole genome sequencing and integrative genomics analyses. The results will be considered for inclusion along with other rich phenotypic and imaging data in COPD disease progression machine learning predictive models. Relevance: Through improved radiographic phenotyping of emphysema distribution, better understanding of disease pathobiology, and more accurate prediction of disease progression, the proposed work will open new avenues of investigation for the development of personalized and improved COPD therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that affects up to 24 million people in the United States, is associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality, and for which there is no available disease-modifying therapy. COPD is associated with significant variation in radiographic, symptomatic and physiologic presentation and exhibits variability in progression. Currently, there is no satisfactory method for progression prediction. This project will identify novel imaging biomarkers of the regional distribution of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema with particular emphasis on their associations with clinical relevant COPD-related outcomes, their genetic determinants, and their ability to improve prediction of COPD disease progression, above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. This is an important area of research as predicting those patients who will remain stable from those who will have rapid disease progression is critical in defining prognosis and selecting patients for specific therapeutic interventions.","Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers",9503881,K08HL141601,"['ACVR1B gene', 'Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Airway Disease', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Volume Reductions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'tomography', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2018,170640,0.01758224007147512
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9441722,R00CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'course development', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaustion', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient subsets', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R00,2018,249000,0.07030917449182256
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9536120,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2018,198669,0.06273172323864432
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,9530687,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2018,186155,0.11383759048319443
"Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary This National Research Service Award (F32) is designed to promote the development of Stephanie Goldstein as an independent, clinical research scientist focused on developing and evaluating strategies for measuring and intervening on health behaviors that capitalize on digital health technology. Behavioral obesity treatment (BOT) produces clinically significant weight loss and health benefits for many individuals with overweight/obesity and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Yet, about half of patients fall short of expected outcomes and most experience gradual weight regain, thus negating the benefits over time. Lapses (i.e., self- reported eating instances that deviate from the BOT prescribed diet) could explain poor outcomes, but the behavior is understudied because it is difficult to assess in-lab and via self-report. We therefore propose to study lapses using a multimethod approach with the following tools: ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device), a wrist-worn device that automatically detects eating behavior and various eating characteristics (frequency, rate, and duration of eating episodes), and 24-hour dietary recalls. We will recruit participants (n=40) with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor to enroll in a 12-week BOT program and follow them through an additional 12-week period of weight loss maintenance. Participants will complete a biweekly 7-day EMA protocol to self-report on eating behavior, including the occurrence of dietary lapse. Participants will continuously wear the wrist-worn ActiGraph Link to characterize eating behavior. Lastly, participants will complete 24-hour dietary recalls via structured interview (split between days with and without lapses) at 6-week intervals to measure the composition of all food and beverages consumed. The proposed study approach is consistent with priorities of NHLBI to optimize clinical research and diagnostic strategies to improve CVD and related risk factors. This project will be conducted in combination with an individualized training program including a curriculum designed to facilitate the acquisition of key skills and experience to move the applicant towards her career goals. This includes didactic and experiential training related to the use of passive sensing technology and related analytic strategies in research, factors that can impede weight maintenance and dietary adherence in BOT, and administration and interpretation of validated nutritional assessment. The applicant will work closely with her primary sponsor, Dr. J. Graham Thomas, her co-sponsors Dr. Rena Wing (renowned expert in weight maintenance), Dr. Adam Hoover (electrical and computer scientist), and Dr. Whitney Evans (nutritional epidemiologist and registered dietician). This mentorship team, in combination with the infrastructure and resources available through the Miriam Hospital Weight Control and Diabetes Research Center and Alpert Brown Medical School, represent the ideal environment to accomplish the applicant's training goals, foster professional development and increase the applicant's autonomy as an independent clinical obesity researcher. Project Narrative The current project is evaluating the utility of a wrist-worn passive sensing device for detecting dietary lapses (i.e., discrete eating instances that deviate from a prescribed diet) and evaluating the behavior's association with weight loss outcomes. Participants, with overweight/obesity and one additional CVD risk factor, will wear wrist-worn devices, complete ecological momentary assessment (EMA; repeated sampling method via mobile device) on dietary lapses, and provide information on dietary composition via semi-regular 24-hour food recalls throughout the duration of a 12-week behavioral weight loss program and 12-week weight maintenance period. This study aims to 1) identifying characteristics of lapse behavior by measuring passively-sensed timing, duration, frequency, and rate of eating amongst known lapse episodes, 2) test the association between dietary lapse frequency and weight change, and 3) estimate nutrition composition of dietary lapses.",Applying Novel Passive Sensing Technology to Target Adherence to Diet in Behavioral Obesity Treatment for Patients with Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9609565,F32HL143954,"['Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Beverages', 'Body Weight Changes', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diet Habits', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dietary intake', 'Dietetics', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Energy Intake', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Food', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Benefit', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Healthy Eating', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Motion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nutrition Assessment', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Weight', 'Weight maintenance regimen', 'Wing', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinically significant', 'contextual factors', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'falls', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obesity treatment', 'prevent', 'real time monitoring', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment program', 'weight loss program', 'weight maintenance', 'willingness']",NHLBI,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,F32,2018,58282,0.00904402881075442
"Optimizing measurement of mindfulness meditation using brain pattern classification. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  	The candidate Dr. Helen Weng is seeking a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award for her immediate career goal to gain mentorship and training to develop the EMBODY Task, a more objective and precise fMRI measure of meditation practice that uses multivariate brain pattern classification methods. Dr. Weng earned her doctorate in clinical psychology researching the neurobiological mechanisms of compassion meditation with Dr. Richard Davidson, an expert in contemplative neuroscience. She is currently a postdoctoral scholar at the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine (OCIM) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in a NCCIH T32-funded fellowship, where she is studying mindful body awareness using neuroscientific and psychophysiological methods. Dr. Weng is rigorously trained in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study contemplative neuroscience; however, she is primarily trained in using standard univariate analyses, which collapse across spatial and temporal information within fMRI data. She recognized the potential limitations of these methods to study the complex and fluctuating mental states that occur during meditation practice, and aims to develop novel fMRI tasks that use multivariate methods (which utilize spatial and temporal variability within fMRI data) to study brain states trained by meditation. Obtaining this K08 to develop the EMBODY Task would support Dr. Weng’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator of the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic benefits of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). 	Dr. Weng’s career development plan includes training in the cognitive neuroscience of attention, fMRI pattern classification, and clinical trial methods to study meditation training. Dr. Weng has assembled a stellar mentoring team including top experts in cognitive neuroscience, mindfulness-based interventions, and pattern classification. Her primary sponsor and mentor, Dr. Adam Gazzaley (Director of the UCSF Neuroscience Imaging Center), is a world-class expert in the cognitive neuroscience of attention and neuroplasticity induced by app-based trainings. Her co-mentor, Dr. Rick Hecht (Research Director at OCIM) is a leading expert in clinical trials of MBIs. Her team also includes experts in fMRI pattern classification methodology (Dr. Bin Yu, Chancellor’s Professor, UC Berkeley; Dr. Melina Uncapher, UCSF) and cognitive neuroscience of internal attention (Dr. David Ziegler, UCSF). Dr. Weng’s training environment is at UCSF, a top NIH-funded research institution, and she will have access to state-of-the-art neuroimaging facilities at the Neuroscience Imaging Center and resources from OCIM, a flagship center for studying meditation. She will regularly meet and communicate with her mentorship team, and complete coursework, fMRI workshops, and training programs to fulfill her training goals. Dr. Weng’s K08 research proposal aims to develop the EMBODY Task, a novel fMRI task that uses brain pattern classification to decode the focus of attention during a period of breath meditation. This task will more accurately measure mental states during meditation by using precise information from individuals’ unique neural signatures. The task will distinguish neural patterns associated with attention (breath attention) and inattention (mind wandering) to the breath, and use these patterns to identify fluctuating brain states during ten minutes of breath meditation. This will produce objective brain-derived metrics of breath attention such as percentage time spent in breath attention, which can then be used to objectively assess outcomes of meditation training. She will pilot, develop, and validate this task within long-term practitioners, meditation novices, and a separate group of novices who go through mobile app-based meditation training. Dr. Weng will use this data to prepare a future R61/R33 proposal that will use the EMBODY Task to more rigorously test the mechanisms of action of how mindfulness-based interventions improve clinical outcomes by training meditation skills. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic pain is an enormous public health issue that affects 100 million Americans and costs more than $600 billion per year in treatments and lost productivity; and major depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States (6.7% prevalence in 2014) and carries the heaviest burden of disability among mental disorders (World Health Organization, 2010). Mindfulness-Based Interventions improve symptoms in chronic pain and depression; however, we do not currently understand what meditation skills learned from mindfulness-based interventions improve symptoms in chronic pain and depression, and this information is needed to improve treatment. This proposal will develop a more accurate and precise measure of meditation practice using brain imaging methods (functional MRI) that can identify attention states during meditation practice.",Optimizing measurement of mindfulness meditation using brain pattern classification.,9415417,K08AT009385,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Body measure procedure', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Categories', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Compassion', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insula of Reil', 'Integrative Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Meditation', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'career', 'career development', 'chronic depression', 'chronic pain', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cost', 'design', 'disability burden', 'health training', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'inattention', 'mental representation', 'mental state', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mindfulness meditation', 'mobile application', 'neural patterning', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'professor', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'symptomatic improvement']",NCCIH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K08,2018,195853,0.05709885313527127

Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9535990,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2018,169112,0.019725075357328883
"Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting Project Summary/Abstract Background and Candidate: Children with orofacial clefting present with increased rate of dental anomalies in shape, size, number, symmetry, abnormal eruption and malposition of teeth both inside and outside the cleft area, leading to dental problems and reduction of quality of life. Although the scientific community has recognized these findings for a long time, the specific etiological factors underlying such anomalies still remain elusive. An important step to understanding etiology is via careful phenotypic approaches that can detect the co-occurrence of such anomalies in discernable patterns that can simplify the identification of risk factors. Dr. Brian Howe is a Clinical Assistant Professor at the College of Dentistry of the University of Iowa. His primary research focus is on the identification and characterization of oral phenotypes in an effort to identify etiological factors underlying the oral phenotypic spectrum of nonsyndromic orofacial clefting. Career Goals: Dr. Howe's short term goals are to deepen is knowledge of complex craniofacial phenotypes and expand his current understanding of craniofacial development. His long term goals are to become a funded independent researcher and a leading clinician and educator in the field of craniofacial phenomics and dentistry as a tenure track faculty at a University of Iowa. His research plan is innovative in that it leverages unique bioinformatics algorithms to identify complex oral phenotypic patterns amenable for studies of risk factors and causality. Environment: The University of Iowa has an established reputation for the successful training of graduate and postdoctoral students in research and clinical areas. It offers learning and development seminars focused on career development and advancement with particular benefits from training opportunities from its Institute for Clinical and Translational Sciences (ICTS). Career Development Plan: Dr. Howe is committed to attend courses, tutorials, seminars and relevant conferences as well as meeting regularly with his mentors, collaborators, and advisory committee to fulfill is training aims and gain the knowledge necessary to achieve his future research goals and become an independent clinical researcher. Research Study: This research aims to identify oral phenotypic patterns in orofacial clefting using modern and traditional pattern mining methods in a diverse international population with existing environmental and genetic variables. This knowledge will have key implications in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting as well as driving the implementation of innovative treatment approaches to improve dental outcomes and future preventive strategies. Project Narrative  Individuals with nonsyndromic orofacial clefting present with a wide range of dental anomalies leading to more intricate oral rehabilitation procedures which increases dental morbidity and reduces quality of life in those affected. In the largest international cohort of families with orofacial clefting and controls to date, this project will utilize pattern mining approaches to detect the co-occurrence of particular dental anomalies in discernable patterns that will likely simplify the search for the etiological factors underlying these anomalies. This research will aid in our understanding of the etiology of orofacial clefting by expanding and further defining oral phenotypes which will drive biologically meaningful strategies for the identification of genetic risk factors as well as helping to improve clinical care.",Identifying phenomic patterns of dental anomalies in orofacial clefting,9582428,K08DE028012,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Career Mobility', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Dental', 'Dental Enamel', 'Dental crowns', 'Dentistry', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Prevalence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maxilla', 'Mentors', 'Mesenchymal', 'Mesenchyme', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Odontogenesis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive', 'Primary Dentition', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Robin bird', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Surgical Flaps', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tooth Germ', 'Tooth structure', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Vascular blood supply', 'analytical tool', 'calcification', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'college', 'craniofacial', 'craniofacial complex', 'craniofacial development', 'design', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'meetings', 'novel', 'orofacial cleft', 'palatogenesis', 'permanent tooth', 'phenomics', 'professor', 'programs', 'repaired', 'research study', 'risk variant', 'symposium', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'trend']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2018,150636,0.03362539539457042
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9479717,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2018,423431,0.03368676261546591

"Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat  Genomes DESCRIPTION: The goal of this BD2K K01 application is to provide Dr. Jeremy W. Prokop with the mentoring and training to be an independent investigator in big data to knowledge. Mentoring and training will be provided to Dr. Prokop in genomics, proteomics, computer science, and statistics to advance his skill to allow for independence. This will allow for further develop of his sequence-to-structure-to-function analysis for interpretation of protein coding genetic variants into a usable workflow available to other scientists. The mentoring throughout this award will be from Dr. Howard Jacob, a leader in rat/human genetics and tool development to understand variants in whole genomes. Additionally, Dr. Andrew Greene serves as a co-mentor to help advance skills in proteomics and Dr. Christina Kendziorski as a co-mentor to advance statistical tools/approaches. The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) is a leader in the use of whole genome sequencing in understanding human health, with a Cap/CLIA certified clinical sequencing facility, tools for identifying genetic variants from whole genomes (such as Carpe Novo), and operation of databases like the Rat Genome Database. These tools and knowledge at MCW will serve as an asset for the training and completion of the Aims in this award. Dr. Prokop's research focus in this grant is to further expand the sequence-to-structure-to-function approaches he developed during his Ph.D. and initial postdoc into a workflow and web submission server for other users. Aim 1 of the grant organizes these steps into a workflow allowing for the development of the web based submission server. To test the workflow, 75 candidate genes for cardiovascular disease will be screened. Initial use of the approach has revealed hypotheses for how genetic variants in Havcr1 and Shroom3 result in altered cardiovascular drug response or disease. Variants in these two proteins will be biochemically characterized using a novel decision tree to standardize experiments (Aim 2) and to serve as a quality control for the approaches of Aim 1. From the results of the 75 screened cardiovascular genes, the four genes with the highest confidence score will be validated using the biochemical decision tree in year four and five of this award serving as an additional quality control for the approaches in Aim 1. This grant will provide the training and support for Dr. Prokop to be integrated into the Medical College of Wisconsin's Clinical Sequencing program, allowing for additional R01 proposals for validation of genetic causes of disease, and facilitate the development of Dr. Prokop into an independent researcher in the use of big data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a new tool package that is able to interpret genetic variants of disease genomes into a testable hypothesis of how protein function is perturbed. This tool will allow for improved diagnostic and treatment methods for many human diseases that employ whole genome/exome sequencing such as cardiovascular, cancer, and rare diseases.",Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat  Genomes,9521380,K01ES025435,"['Actins', 'Affinity', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'CLIA certified', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimerization', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Filtration', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lisinopril', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Precipitation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'SFN gene', 'Science of genetics', 'Scientist', 'Serine', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'clinical sequencing', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'data to knowledge', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic variant', 'genome database', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'mutant', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'rat genome', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,97903,0.0386230478901624
"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,9427961,K08AI125682,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Africa', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Sterility', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Target Populations', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'insight', 'malaria transmission', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parasite invasion', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'professor', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'surveillance data', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K08,2018,185224,0.02989905402695118
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments.

"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,9666625,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2018,194005,0.08438376168246324
"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers. One emerging target for research involves using functional MRI to study brain systems that contribute to risk. This project will explore the neural correlates of positive and negative valence emotional processing and how they contribute to risk for the development of alcohol use disorders. Better understanding of these neural processes could inform us about how alcohol use disorders emerge and, importantly, how we might prevent them.",Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism,9752706,R00AA024778,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcoholism', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Extramural Activities', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Loudness', 'Machine Learning', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Review Literature', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Targeted Research', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'aged', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'faculty research', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'negative affect', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'predicting response', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'underage drinking']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2018,249000,-0.014520883918956388

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9530648,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2018,220530,0.07575555922879708
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial.

"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,9504767,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Blood Pressure', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2018,172141,0.06766076064981752

Research: Dr. Feldman will rigorously define SLE-related conditions that may result in avoidable acute care use (e.g. emergency department visits and hospitalizations). She will then examine rates and predictors of potentially avoidable use, and associated mortality and costs in two large, diverse datasets. She will learn and apply qualitative methods, including Photovoice, which will empower SLE patients to photograph their homes and communities, to explore the contribution of social determinants to avoidable care use. Dr. Feldman will hold focus groups of SLE patients, providers and administrators to design a rheumatology-based intervention to improve healthcare delivery for these high-utilizing, vulnerable SLE patients. Dr. Feldman will develop skills in rigorous mixed methods research. This project, and the training Dr. Feldman will gain, will position her for a R01 and for a career as an independent social epidemiology and patient-oriented investigator in rheumatology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lupus is a complex autoimmune disease, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and resulting in high acute care use, much of which could be prevented if patients had consistent access to high-quality outpatient care. There is a need to define and understand lupus-specific avoidable acute care use (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) and to identify those patients at highest risk. This study will inform the design of interventions aimed at optimizing outpatient care, preventing adverse outcomes, and reducing disparities among patients with complex, subspecialty-managed diseases.",Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus,9444441,K23AR071500,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Administrator', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delphi Technique', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Financial Support', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lupus', 'Mediating', 'Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Social support', 'Structural Models', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'care costs', 'career', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'doctoral student', 'ethnic minority population', 'health care delivery', 'health management', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'instructor', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'population health', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'research and development', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'therapy design']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2018,178195,0.10394564248501596
"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly. This project will develop automated tools to increase measurement throughput, and explore new image-based biomarkers that will significantly add to the assessment of patient prognosis, and will have the ability to more quickly judge the effectiveness of interventions.",Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD,9566167,K01DK110136,"['Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'FarGo', 'Fibrosis', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Tissue', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Spin Labels', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'educational atmosphere', 'functional decline', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'kidney vascular structure', 'knowledge base', 'novel imaging technology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'prognostic value', 'radiological imaging', 'renal artery', 'research study', 'shear stress', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K01,2018,154915,0.029930295322296886
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,9198041,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency research', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2017,163944,0.023393199504497864
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,9324206,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Preventive measure', 'Process', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2017,156686,0.09610208573668352
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,9306838,K23DK101687,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modernization', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'blood-based biomarker', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'glycoproteomics', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lecturer', 'matriculation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'personalized medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool development', 'translational impact', 'translational scientist', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2017,194400,0.09745856111719219
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9394884,R00CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Model', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drowsiness', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mosaicism', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'course development', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaustion', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R00,2017,249000,0.07030917449182256
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9324356,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2017,198838,0.06273172323864432
"Measuring Inequality in Early Mortality Across All Births in the Developing World Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Antonio Pedro Ramos graduated with a PhD in Political Science in 2015 and an MS in Statistics in 2014, both from UCLA. His dissertation investigated the effects of recent democratization waves on infant and child mortality among the poor in developing countries. In his graduate work, health indicators were used as a tool to test political economy theories, and thus were not the main focus of his analysis. This fellowship will allow Dr. Ramos to obtain the demographic, statistical and health policy expertise to transit from being a political scientist to become a health scholar working with health inequality.  One fundamental dimension of social inequality is inequality in early-life survival. To date, most studies on early-life mortality analyze between-group comparisons, such as income groups within the same country, and they have documented large disparities. While between-group differences are informative they mask important disparities in the mortality risk within groups. Dr Ramos' proposed project is to develop methodologies that (1) can measure inequality in early-life mortality among all births and (2) improve policy targeting by identifying small cells of high risk births that are nested within and across large groups of births.  During the K99 phase, with supervision from his mentors, Dr. Ramos will develop the methodologies that can be used to characterize and explain inequality in early-life mortality across all births and identify high risk births. His methods will be tested on a data set he already acquired that includes records on 5.5 million births from 50 developing countries. In his R00 phase, he will implement large-scale analysis by combining data from multiple sources to produce globals maps of health inequality and high risk births, as well as examine the impact of health policies on reducing child mortality.  UCLA is the ideal place for Dr. Ramos' training and research in public health and applied statistics because of its unique combination of expertise. This includes Dr. Ramos' mentoring team, several other scholars that work on similar topics in various academic centers, classes, seminars, and computational and technical resources that are available at UCLA.  Dr. Ramos is contributing to research and policy practice by developing a methodology that will allow re- searchers and policymakers to measure inequality in early mortality across births and to identify high risk births regardless of their large group membership. By doing so, this project will be the ﬁrst to: 1) draw a time-varying map of total inequality in early mortality across the developing world; 2) identify major correlates of these dispar- ities; and 3) develop more cost effective public health policies. Project Narrative Most studies on early-life mortality compare large groups of births, such as poor and non-poor within countries, and design health interventions to reduce disparities between these groups. These comparisons mask large disparities in mortality risk within births from the same group. The goal of this project is to develop a methodology to measure inequality across births and to better target public health interventions.",Measuring Inequality in Early Mortality Across All Births in the Developing World,9325555,K99HD088727,"['Address', 'Birth', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child Mortality', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Survey', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fellowship', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infant Mortality', 'International Agencies', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Politics', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survey Methodology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'comparison group', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'mortality', 'mortality disparity', 'policy implication', 'public health intervention', 'semiparametric', 'social inequality', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2017,123390,0.03271048224973839
"Role of Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells in the Immune Response to Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surgical trauma produces a profound inflammatory response that, when deregulated, leads to adverse surgical outcomes including protracted recovery, infection, and organ dysfunction. The immune response to surgery involves complex, multi-cellular mechanisms that are poorly understood. The long-term goals of this proposal are to: 1) use a systems-wide approach to enumerate and characterize the major immune cell subsets, on a cell-by-cell basis, from whole blood samples taken from patients undergoing surgery; 2) understand the mechanistic basis of immune-modulatory interventions designed to improve surgical outcomes (e.g., L-arginine supplementation); 3) understand the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity in order to identify specific mechanisms that are critical for patients' recovery from surgery. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gaudilliere will use a next-generation flow cytometry platform (Cytometry by Time of Flight or CyTOF), recently pioneered and brought to practical utility in the laboratory of Dr. Garry Nolan (Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University and primary mentor for this K23 award). Uniting flow cytometry with mass spectrometry enables readouts from rare earth metal isotopes tagged to antibodies. In contrast to traditional fluorescence-based cytometry, the absence of overlap between detection signals allows for a dramatic increase in the number of parameters that can be measured at the single-cell level (currently up to 45). In a pilot study and working under the guidance of Drs. Garry Nolan and Martin Angst (Professor of Anesthesiology, Stanford University), Dr. Gaudilliere established a quantitative and reproducible mass cytometry assay with which to monitor the immune response in patients undergoing hip replacement (i.e., total hip arthroplasty). The data from this study form the groundwork for Dr. Gaudilliere's core hypothesis that Surgery-induced Myeloid Cells (SiMCs) phenocopy MDSCs and suppress the CD8+ T cell adaptive immune response to surgery via an L-arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 1, Dr. Gaudilliere will build an in vitro system to investigate whether SiMCs suppress terminal effector CD8+ T cell (CD8+Teff) function via an L- arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 2, Dr. Gaudilliere proposes a first interventional clinical trial that will use mass cytometry o investigate whether L-arginine supplementation in patients undergoing THA will restore CD8+Teff response in vivo. In Aim 3, Dr. Gaudilliere will adapt and implement statistical tools and learning algorithms (e.g., the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator or LASSO) to investigate whether patient- specific immune features predict surgery-induced expansion of SiMCs and suppression of CD8+Teff cells.  Dr. Gaudilliere is an anesthesiologist at Stanford University School of Medicine with a background in engineering, biochemistry, and molecular biology, and is therefore exceptionally well qualified to address these aims. The Nolan Lab, acknowledged as world-class in the application of mass cytometry to single-cell analysis, will provide Dr. Gaudilliere with the opportunity and environment to acquire the skills for him to become a leading expert in this technology. Furthermore, Dr. Gaudilliere is supported by a multidisciplinary and collaborative team with expertise in signaling biology, human immunology, statistics and bio-informatics, and clinical experimental science and trial design. He will also benefit from the combined strength and resources provided by the Stanford Departments of Anesthesiology, Immunology, and Statistics. To accomplish his research goals and prepare him for a career as an independent investigator, Dr. Gaudilliere has created a multi-disciplinary career development plan incorporating: 1) advanced training in human immunology and immune monitoring with mass cytometry; 2) graduate level didactics in epidemiology and mentored training in clinical study design; and 3) graduate level didactics and mentored training in biostatistics, data mining, and application of machine learning methods for the analysis of complex datasets derived from mass cytometry. In summary, single-cell mass cytometry will be utilized to monitor immune responses to surgery at the systems level in vivo. This approach will not only elucidate specific mechanisms (e.g., arginine-dependent SiMC-mediated suppression of CD8+ T cells) but will also characterize these mechanisms as they occur in the context of the entire immune system. The multidimensional attribute of the data will necessarily generate deeper and potentially more clinically relevant hypotheses than previously posed. The output of this proposal constitutes a data-driven strategy to guide future research efforts and R01 applications to identify patient- specific immune traits predictive of surgical outcomes and explore novel immune-modulatory strategies to improve recovery from surgery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over forty million surgeries are performed annually in the US alone. Surgical trauma produces a profound inflammatory response that is associated with significant co-morbidity including protracted recovery, poor wound healing, infection, and organ dysfunction. Our research addresses this serious public health problem by 1) elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern the immune response of patients undergoing surgery, 2) characterizing the mechanisms by which immune-modulatory therapies improve surgical outcomes, and 3) identifying patient-specific immunologic markers that determine the immune response to surgery. Knowledge gained from this research is foundational for identifying immune markers that predict recovery from surgery in individual patients and for advancing therapeutic strategies that will improve recovery.",Role of Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells in the Immune Response to Surgery,9329469,K23GM111657,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Anesthesiology', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Arginine', 'Attenuated', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Survival', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune signaling', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intervention', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Myeloid Cell Suppression', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Natural Immunity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Phenocopy', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Postoperative Period', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'RNA Interference', 'Randomized', 'Rare Earth Metals', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stat5 protein', 'Supervision', 'Supplementation', 'Suppressor-Effector T-Lymphocytes', 'Surface', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Whole Blood', 'Wound Healing', 'adaptive immune response', 'adaptive immunity', 'arginase', 'base', 'biocomputing', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'data mining', 'design', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'monocyte', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive marker', 'primary outcome', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'trait', 'trial design']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2017,130988,0.027404196561236896
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,9384844,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2017,186151,0.11383759048319443
"Optimizing measurement of mindfulness meditation using brain pattern classification. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  	The candidate Dr. Helen Weng is seeking a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award for her immediate career goal to gain mentorship and training to develop the EMBODY Task, a more objective and precise fMRI measure of meditation practice that uses multivariate brain pattern classification methods. Dr. Weng earned her doctorate in clinical psychology researching the neurobiological mechanisms of compassion meditation with Dr. Richard Davidson, an expert in contemplative neuroscience. She is currently a postdoctoral scholar at the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine (OCIM) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) in a NCCIH T32-funded fellowship, where she is studying mindful body awareness using neuroscientific and psychophysiological methods. Dr. Weng is rigorously trained in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study contemplative neuroscience; however, she is primarily trained in using standard univariate analyses, which collapse across spatial and temporal information within fMRI data. She recognized the potential limitations of these methods to study the complex and fluctuating mental states that occur during meditation practice, and aims to develop novel fMRI tasks that use multivariate methods (which utilize spatial and temporal variability within fMRI data) to study brain states trained by meditation. Obtaining this K08 to develop the EMBODY Task would support Dr. Weng’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator of the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic benefits of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs). 	Dr. Weng’s career development plan includes training in the cognitive neuroscience of attention, fMRI pattern classification, and clinical trial methods to study meditation training. Dr. Weng has assembled a stellar mentoring team including top experts in cognitive neuroscience, mindfulness-based interventions, and pattern classification. Her primary sponsor and mentor, Dr. Adam Gazzaley (Director of the UCSF Neuroscience Imaging Center), is a world-class expert in the cognitive neuroscience of attention and neuroplasticity induced by app-based trainings. Her co-mentor, Dr. Rick Hecht (Research Director at OCIM) is a leading expert in clinical trials of MBIs. Her team also includes experts in fMRI pattern classification methodology (Dr. Bin Yu, Chancellor’s Professor, UC Berkeley; Dr. Melina Uncapher, UCSF) and cognitive neuroscience of internal attention (Dr. David Ziegler, UCSF). Dr. Weng’s training environment is at UCSF, a top NIH-funded research institution, and she will have access to state-of-the-art neuroimaging facilities at the Neuroscience Imaging Center and resources from OCIM, a flagship center for studying meditation. She will regularly meet and communicate with her mentorship team, and complete coursework, fMRI workshops, and training programs to fulfill her training goals. Dr. Weng’s K08 research proposal aims to develop the EMBODY Task, a novel fMRI task that uses brain pattern classification to decode the focus of attention during a period of breath meditation. This task will more accurately measure mental states during meditation by using precise information from individuals’ unique neural signatures. The task will distinguish neural patterns associated with attention (breath attention) and inattention (mind wandering) to the breath, and use these patterns to identify fluctuating brain states during ten minutes of breath meditation. This will produce objective brain-derived metrics of breath attention such as percentage time spent in breath attention, which can then be used to objectively assess outcomes of meditation training. She will pilot, develop, and validate this task within long-term practitioners, meditation novices, and a separate group of novices who go through mobile app-based meditation training. Dr. Weng will use this data to prepare a future R61/R33 proposal that will use the EMBODY Task to more rigorously test the mechanisms of action of how mindfulness-based interventions improve clinical outcomes by training meditation skills. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic pain is an enormous public health issue that affects 100 million Americans and costs more than $600 billion per year in treatments and lost productivity; and major depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States (6.7% prevalence in 2014) and carries the heaviest burden of disability among mental disorders (World Health Organization, 2010). Mindfulness-Based Interventions improve symptoms in chronic pain and depression; however, we do not currently understand what meditation skills learned from mindfulness-based interventions improve symptoms in chronic pain and depression, and this information is needed to improve treatment. This proposal will develop a more accurate and precise measure of meditation practice using brain imaging methods (functional MRI) that can identify attention states during meditation practice.",Optimizing measurement of mindfulness meditation using brain pattern classification.,9224446,K08AT009385,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Body measure procedure', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Categories', 'Cereals', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Compassion', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development Plans', 'Educational workshop', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insula of Reil', 'Integrative Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Meditation', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'San Francisco', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'career', 'career development', 'chronic depression', 'chronic pain', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cost', 'design', 'disability burden', 'health training', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'inattention', 'mental representation', 'mental state', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mindfulness meditation', 'mobile application', 'neural patterning', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'professor', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'symptomatic improvement']",NCCIH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K08,2017,195853,0.05709885313527127
"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9369218,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2017,170466,0.019725075357328883
"Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat Genomes DESCRIPTION: The goal of this BD2K K01 application is to provide Dr. Jeremy W. Prokop with the mentoring and training to be an independent investigator in big data to knowledge. Mentoring and training will be provided to Dr. Prokop in genomics, proteomics, computer science, and statistics to advance his skill to allow for independence. This will allow for further develop of his sequence-to-structure-to-function analysis for interpretation of protein coding genetic variants into a usable workflow available to other scientists. The mentoring throughout this award will be from Dr. Howard Jacob, a leader in rat/human genetics and tool development to understand variants in whole genomes. Additionally, Dr. Andrew Greene serves as a co-mentor to help advance skills in proteomics and Dr. Christina Kendziorski as a co-mentor to advance statistical tools/approaches. The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) is a leader in the use of whole genome sequencing in understanding human health, with a Cap/CLIA certified clinical sequencing facility, tools for identifying genetic variants from whole genomes (such as Carpe Novo), and operation of databases like the Rat Genome Database. These tools and knowledge at MCW will serve as an asset for the training and completion of the Aims in this award. Dr. Prokop's research focus in this grant is to further expand the sequence-to-structure-to-function approaches he developed during his Ph.D. and initial postdoc into a workflow and web submission server for other users. Aim 1 of the grant organizes these steps into a workflow allowing for the development of the web based submission server. To test the workflow, 75 candidate genes for cardiovascular disease will be screened. Initial use of the approach has revealed hypotheses for how genetic variants in Havcr1 and Shroom3 result in altered cardiovascular drug response or disease. Variants in these two proteins will be biochemically characterized using a novel decision tree to standardize experiments (Aim 2) and to serve as a quality control for the approaches of Aim 1. From the results of the 75 screened cardiovascular genes, the four genes with the highest confidence score will be validated using the biochemical decision tree in year four and five of this award serving as an additional quality control for the approaches in Aim 1. This grant will provide the training and support for Dr. Prokop to be integrated into the Medical College of Wisconsin's Clinical Sequencing program, allowing for additional R01 proposals for validation of genetic causes of disease, and facilitate the development of Dr. Prokop into an independent researcher in the use of big data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a new tool package that is able to interpret genetic variants of disease genomes into a testable hypothesis of how protein function is perturbed. This tool will allow for improved diagnostic and treatment methods for many human diseases that employ whole genome/exome sequencing such as cardiovascular, cancer, and rare diseases.",Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat Genomes,9310007,K01ES025435,"['Actins', 'Affinity', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'CLIA certified', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimerization', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Filtration', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lisinopril', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Precipitation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'SFN gene', 'Science of genetics', 'Scientist', 'Serine', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'clinical sequencing', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'data to knowledge', 'dimer', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic variant', 'genome database', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'mutant', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'rat genome', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HUDSON-ALPHA INSTITUTE FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY,K01,2017,63921,0.0386230478901624
"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,9314691,K08AI125682,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Africa', 'African', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Sterility', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Target Populations', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'insight', 'malaria transmission', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parasite invasion', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'professor', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'surveillance data', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K08,2017,185224,0.02989905402695118
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9270644,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2017,313812,0.03368676261546591
"Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract The applicant Udo Hoffmann MD MPH is a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and the Chief of the Division for Cardiovascular Imaging in the Department of Radiology at MGH. Dr. Hoffmann has established a patient oriented research (POR) program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research methods to demonstrate the value of advanced cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Hoffmann has published approximately 380 peer reviewed papers, among them many in premier medical journals and has received continued independent, peer-reviewed POR NIH funding since 2005. He is among the very few faculty members at Harvard Medical School who are both the PI and Director of a highly successful NHLBI funded T- 32 program (Cardiac MR and CT Research) and a recipient of a K24. Dr. Hoffmann has successfully mentored more than 60 clinical investigators, most of which currently hold faculty positions in major academic centers and actively perform POR. Moreover, Dr. Hoffmann has successfully accomplished all mentoring and scientific goals of the first K24 award period. Overall, these achievements document Dr. Hoffmann's long standing passion and commitment to POR. His excellent publication, funding, and mentoring record together with his current and planned research support provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the aims of this competitive renewal of the K24 Award “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. Dr. Hoffmann proposes a mentoring and research plan that utilizes the synergies of past, ongoing, and future highly innovative independent research projects with educational and training opportunities offered by the cardiac MR CT PET Program, the T32 training program in cardiovascular imaging, the Harvard CTSA, and the Harvard School of Public Health. The specific aims addressing the charge of the K24 Award are to enable Dr. Hoffmann to: 1) dedicate 25% of his time to mentor clinical investigators based on NIH or equivalent funded projects in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”, 2) to mentor junior and mid-career clinical investigators with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants, and 3) to continue to expand a POR program that combines translational, clinical, and outcomes research to develop future leaders in clinical research in cardiovascular imaging and beyond. The research plan encompasses four specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of statin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis in HIV patients in 800 patients with HIV randomized to statin therapy vs. placebo, 2) To determine whether high risk coronary plaque predicts cardiovascular events in 4600 patients with clinical suspicion of CAD, 3) To determine the cost effectiveness of CT FFR in patients with stable and acute chest pain, and 4) To use Radiomics to identify novel imaging markers predicting cardiovascular events in participants of the Framingham Heart Study. Narrative This research takes advantage of a rich body of independent funded research in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. It will permit Dr. Hoffmann to dedicate 25% of his time to mentor junior clinical investigators from the T32 program and the pool of residents, fellows, and junior faculty in Cardiology and Radiology with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants.

"Mechanisms of Increased Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Intradialytic Hypertension DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This NIH Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award proposal describes a 5 year training program with the long-term goal of the candidate developing into an independent academic investigator with a research focus in hypertension in patients with chronic and end-stage kidney disease. The candidate will build on a background in clinical research developed during a comprehensive research fellowship spent studying ambulatory blood pressure and endothelial cell dysfunction in patients with intradialytic hypertension. The career development objectives are to obtain skills in designing and conducting prospective clinical research studies, learn statistical models to analyze ambulatory blood pressure in hemodialysis patients, gain experience in measuring and interpreting cardiovascular physiologic parameters including extracellular water and vascular resistance utilizing bioimpedance analysis, and participate in scholarly activities to facilitate te transition into an independent investigator. These will be applied immediately to investigating how extracellular volume and mediators of vascular resistance affect ambulatory blood pressure in patients with intradialytic hypertension and hemodialysis controls. Aim 1 will use a case control design to compare differences in extracellular water in patients with intradialytic hypertension and hemodialysis controls. Aim 2 will determine how extracellular volume, vasoconstrictor mediators of vascular resistance, and vascular resistance itself modify ambulatory blood pressure and the ambulatory blood pressure slope in these two groups. In aim 3, the candidate will gain experience in designing and conducting a randomized trial by comparing the effects of carvedilol vs. prazosin on ambulatory blood pressure, vascular resistance, and mediators of vascular resistance in patients with intradialytic hypertension. The candidate will develop these skills with the support a primary mentor, 3 co-mentors (including one translational research cardiologist and one biostatistician), and a research advisory committee with extensive experience in multiple research disciplines. The candidate and his advisors are located at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, a leading academic medical center with substantial physical and intellectual resources necessary for the career development of young investigators and the performance of cutting-edge research. The candidate will take advantage of numerous courses and research activities as a Clinical Research Scholar in the Department of Clinical Sciences that will promote the overall development of his career. Consistent with the candidate's long term career goals, the findings from this study can be broadened to studying hypertension in hemodialysis patients in general. Understanding the relationship between extracellular volume, vascular resistance, and ambulatory blood pressure will provide the opportunity to investigate how pharmacologic therapies affect each component and how this can improve cardiovascular outcomes in hemodialysis patients. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In hemodialysis patients, high blood pressure increases the risk for death and complications related to heart disease. This research studies how hemodynamic changes during dialysis are associated with high blood pressure measured throughout the entire 44 hour period between dialysis treatments. Findings from this project will direct future studies that investigate which medications or interventions will most successfully lower blood pressure and reduce adverse events in hemodialysis patients.",Mechanisms of Increased Ambulatory Blood Pressure in Intradialytic Hypertension,9303381,K23DK096007,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists', 'Adverse event', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Angiotensin II', 'Award', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Water', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dietary Sodium', 'Discipline', 'End stage renal failure', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelin-1', 'Fellowship', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Impedance Cardiography', 'In Vitro', 'Ingestion', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'N,N-dimethylarginine', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Prazosin', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Ultrafiltration', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Vascular resistance', 'Vasoconstrictor Agents', 'Water', 'beta-adrenergic receptor', 'blood pressure reduction', 'blood pressure regulation', 'career', 'career development', 'carvedilol', 'case control', 'design', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'mortality', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'research study', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'trial comparing', 'vasoconstriction']",NIDDK,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2017,159840,0.02671853256964957
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture, and affects over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is a class of gene that has largely been understudied, and recent studies suggested their potential roles in autoimmune diseases. This project aims to expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and advance identification of lncRNAs that play functional roles in psoriasis pathogenesis.",Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology,9371181,K01AR072129,"['Affect', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Catalogs', 'Cellular Structures', 'Chromatin', 'Chronic', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Coronary artery', 'Cutaneous', 'Data', 'Dermatologic', 'Dermatology', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economic Burden', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Faculty', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Homing', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'London', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Psoriasis', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Societies', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Systems Biology', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'candidate identification', 'career development', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'college', 'cytokine', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'immunoregulation', 'insight', 'interest', 'keratinocyte', 'knock-down', 'laboratory experience', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'scaffold', 'skills', 'skin disorder', 'small hairpin RNA', 'statistical center', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2017,104175,0.030331497535730514

The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9326841,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K01,2017,225549,0.07575555922879708
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials.

"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Application ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase IIB application, we propose to commercialize and bring to market EyeArt, a fully automated, high throughput, retinal image analysis based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening tool (which has been developed and already validated in bench tests on very large real-world data) by conducting formal clinical trials and integrating it into several clinical information systems. With its fully automated use, high throughput capability (can analyze several thousands of patient cases in just a few hours), scalable architecture, and ability to seamlessly integrate into clinical workflows, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye care providers. DR is a common microvascular complication of diabetes affecting 80% of all diabetic patients. Even though vision loss due to DR is preventable by early detection and treatment, it is the one of the leading global causes of preventable blindness primarily due to the lack of easy access to eye care providers. Automated DR screening is the only way to make DR screening more accessible to the large and growing population of diabetic patients, currently 29 million in the US and 387 million world-wide and expected to grow to 110 million and 592 million respectively by 2030.  To help reduce risk of DR vision loss in the diabetic population, EyeArt uses advanced image analysis algorithms to make DR screening more efficient, cost-effective, and more accessible. EyeArt has been validated and shown to have high screening sensitivity (safety) and efficacy on multiple large real-world datasets including one with over 54,000 patient cases (and 434,000 images) obtained from EyePACS, a DR telescreening system with over 360 sites in the US and elsewhere. Eyenuk has received ISO 13485 certification as a medical device manufacturer and EyeArt has received CE Marking and is commercially available in Europe. Going forward, we will clinically validate EyeArt in formal clinical trials and integrate it into clinical informatio systems to enable EyeArt's seamless incorporation into existing clinical workflows. This will pave the way for EyeArt's availability to the US DR screening market and reduce the burden on clinical resources by improving health care productivity. This will help increase the DR screening conformance in the diabetic population and thus help in reducing and ultimately eliminating vision loss due to DR through early detection and treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeArt, a fully automated, high throughput, retinal image analysis based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening system will help in screening patients in need of expert care thus making DR screening more efficient, cost- effective, and accessible. EyeArt's integration into EyePACS, a DR telescreening system, will facilitate an expansion of DR screening within the large and expanding EyePACs network of primary care centers in the US and elsewhere. We are also collaborating with Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS) which already uses the EyePACS to deploy our system following clinical validation, in their under-resourced safety net teleretinal screening setup which caters to large disparity populations of LA County. The increased access to DR screening will help reduce and ultimately eliminate vision loss due to DR through early detection and treatment.",Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Application,9319270,R44EY026864,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Background Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Blindness', 'Caliber', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consult', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Europe', 'European', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Felis catus', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Italy', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Observational Study', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'cost effective', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'high throughput analysis', 'improved', 'macular edema', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'safety net', 'screening', 'secondary analysis', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2017,513223,0.0830125035872852
"Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this grant proposal is to develop and assess a system to enhance the rational and personalized application of antiplatelet therapy for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, or coronary angioplasty and stenting). This proposal describes a 5 year research and training program designed to provide the candidate, Robert Yeh, the necessary skills and experience to develop an independent academic research career in the conduct of translational cardiovascular outcomes research. Candidate: Dr. Yeh received an MSc in health policy from the London School of Economics, an MD from Harvard Medical School, and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (UCSF) and interventional cardiology (MGH). He is now a junior faculty member at the Massachusetts General Hospital with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. While he has successfully been involved with epidemiologic and secondary data analysis, Dr. Yeh will pursue additional training in the areas of decision analysis, clinical trial conduct and implementation research, and bioinformatics - training which will allow him to translate outcomes research findings into novel interventions which improve patient health. The candidate's long-term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the applied outcomes research that has a broad impact on population health. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Dr. Laura Mauri (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and chief scientific officer of the Harvard Clinical Research Institute (HCRI), and Dr. Sharon- Lise Normand (Co-Mentor), Professor of Health Care Policy at HMS and Vice Chair of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute's Methods Committee. Both are internationally recognized leaders in their respective fields, and provide complementary expertise relevant to the research and training of the candidate. Dr. Mauri has an established track record of successfully leading practice-changing multicenter clinical trials in interventional cardiology, including the NIH/FDA/Industry-sponsored Dual Antiplatelet Theray (DAPT) Study. She has mentored several cardiovascular clinical investigators, including those that have received K awards and R01 funding. Dr. Normand has successfully mentored a large number of successful academic investigators, and is an internationally recognized expert in outcomes and comparative effectiveness research methods used in this proposal. The combined resources of several Harvard Medical School institutions, including HCRI, the Department of Health Care Policy, and the MGH Heart Center will support a rich and productive environment for Dr. Yeh's career development through a combination of didactic training, seminars, weekly research meetings, and conference presentations. Research: In the current era of invasive management of coronary artery disease, balancing the tradeoff between ischemic events and bleeding complications has become integral to decisions regarding the type and duration of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary intervention. In Aim 1, multivariable logistic regression will be used to develop models that can predict bleeding and ischemic events in patients after PCI depending on antiplatelet strategy, using data from the DAPT Study, the largest PCI clinical trial conducted to date, and the Massachusetts PCI Registry, a comprehensive longitudinal registry of patients undergoing coronary intervention. Models that can predict treatment benefit or harm associated with specific strategies will be developed. In Aim 2, decision analysis methods will be employed to enhance these models such that the treatment strategy which is predicted to maximize patient benefit can be identified for all patients, and associated uncertainty in this determination can be assessed. In Aim 3, these tools will be integrated into a novel software application that can execute multivariable risk predictions at the point of care within the MGH cardiac catheterization laboratory. These tools will be used as clinical decision aids, and tested in a prospective randomized clinical trial to determine whether such interventions can enhance clinical decision making. The research will demonstrate how the end products of outcomes research can be translated into innovative interventions that can ""personalize"" medical decisions and ultimately improve patient care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stenting of the heart arteries is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the US. Patients who have these procedures are at risk for having both bleeding and clot-related complications during the procedure as well as for months to years afterwards, which require the careful use of antiplatelet medications. This research will develop and assess the impact of tools that can be used by clinicians and patients to help inform the best use of antiplatelet medications after stenting of the heart arteries, such that bleeding and clotting risks associated with these procedures can be minimized for patients.",Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio,9061806,K23HL118138,"['Adverse event', 'Age', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Analysis', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'London', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Population Intervention', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'Stents', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'alternative treatment', 'analytical method', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical candidate', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'coronary angioplasty', 'design', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'percutaneous coronary intervention', 'point of care', 'population health', 'professor', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'routine care', 'routine practice', 'skills', 'study population', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'usability']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2017,164376,0.07984698180966171
"Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Candace Feldman is an Instructor in Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy and the Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). Dr. Feldman has a longstanding passion to understand and reduce disparities in rheumatic diseases. Her research focuses on racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in prevalence, access and outcomes among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Her 14 peer-reviewed original publications, 8 first author, and 2 early career development grants exemplify her track record and her commitment to this field. She holds a MPH degree and is pursuing a doctorate in social epidemiology from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her immediate goals are to learn and apply advanced health services research and qualitative methods to understand SLE-related avoidable acute care use to inform a future intervention. She will be guided by Dr. Costenbader, an established SLE epidemiologist, and an expert mentoring team. Dr. Feldman strives to apply rigorous methods to redesign healthcare delivery for vulnerable rheumatology patients. Environment: Dr. Feldman’s Division Chief ensures that >75% of her time will be protected for research and career development for the 5-year duration of this K23 award. She has financial support to supplement her salary and project-related expenses from the Division, the SCS, and her primary mentor’s funding. The BWH Lupus Center, co-directed by Dr. Costenbader, is the largest in New England. The research infrastructure established as part of the Center will enable Dr. Feldman to recruit patients. In addition, the SCS has extensive research infrastructure, which will continue to support her work. Dr. Feldman has access to Medicaid data under Dr. Costenbader’s Data Use Agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and to Partners HealthCare electronic health records linked to claims data through the explicit support of Population Health Management. For her training, she will have access to courses and mentorship at HSPH, where she is a doctoral student, and through Harvard Medical School and the Harvard Catalyst Program. Research: Dr. Feldman will rigorously define SLE-related conditions that may result in avoidable acute care use (e.g. emergency department visits and hospitalizations). She will then examine rates and predictors of potentially avoidable use, and associated mortality and costs in two large, diverse datasets. She will learn and apply qualitative methods, including Photovoice, which will empower SLE patients to photograph their homes and communities, to explore the contribution of social determinants to avoidable care use. Dr. Feldman will hold focus groups of SLE patients, providers and administrators to design a rheumatology-based intervention to improve healthcare delivery for these high-utilizing, vulnerable SLE patients. Dr. Feldman will develop skills in rigorous mixed methods research. This project, and the training Dr. Feldman will gain, will position her for a R01 and for a career as an independent social epidemiology and patient-oriented investigator in rheumatology. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lupus is a complex autoimmune disease, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations and resulting in high acute care use, much of which could be prevented if patients had consistent access to high-quality outpatient care. There is a need to define and understand lupus-specific avoidable acute care use (emergency department visits and hospitalizations) and to identify those patients at highest risk. This study will inform the design of interventions aimed at optimizing outpatient care, preventing adverse outcomes, and reducing disparities among patients with complex, subspecialty-managed diseases.",Avoidable Acute Care Use among Patients with Lupus,9294418,K23AR071500,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Accounting', 'Acute', 'Administrator', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caring', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Delphi Technique', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Expenditure', 'Financial Support', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Care Research', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lupus', 'Mediating', 'Medicaid', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhoods', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rheumatism', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Social support', 'Structural Models', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'cost', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'doctoral student', 'ethnic minority population', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'instructor', 'learning strategy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'population health', 'prevent', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'research and development', 'skills', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'therapy design']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2017,178195,0.10394564248501596
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,9117645,R00LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'memory process', 'model building', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'neurovascular', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R00,2016,244245,0.030769479178070748
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,9121614,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Mobility', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Degree program', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker panel', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'learning strategy', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2016,135270,0.030049537184180134
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8984911,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2016,163944,0.023393199504497864
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,9108235,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'diagnostic assay', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'metabolic profile', 'metabolome', 'microbial', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'training opportunity', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2016,137160,0.070030635508109
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,9133363,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Preventive measure', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2016,157765,0.09610208573668352
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research.

"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,9125796,K99CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Fat Diet', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning network', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2016,109620,0.07030917449182256
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9164389,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Staging', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2016,198612,0.06273172323864432
"Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Richard D. Boyce, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has training in informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research as well as a strong commitment to improving medication safety for older adults. His prior work has focused on artificial intelligence methods for predicting drug-drug interactions and the comparative safety of antidepressants for treating de-pressed nursing home residents. The current proposal is for a three year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that will address gaps in his knowledge of aging research and the nursing home setting. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Charles Reynolds, Jordan Karp, and Steven Handler) he has developed a training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on how to effectively translate research results from pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research to informatics interventions that improve medication safety for older adults, especially nursing home residents. To accomplish this goal, he proposes eight career development activities and two research aims that will help him 1) obtain rigorous training in the science and practice of creating clinical decision support interventions that are effective in the nursing home setting; 2) obtain a thorough understanding of how falls and fall risk factors are detected, monitored, reported, and assessed in the nursing home setting; and 3) learn the perceptions of multiple nursing home clinician stakeholders on what research is needed to help reduce medication-related adverse events. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by exploring the feasibility and potential clinical usefulness of actively monitoring patients exposed to psycho- tropic PDDIs. The approach would use electronic data available in most United States (US) NHs to provide highly specific and actionable alerts to physicians and/or nurses when a resident who is exposed to a PDDI involving a psychotropic drug transitions to a state of unacceptably high risk for experiencing a fall. Dr. Boyce's hypothesis is that this approach will extend the ability of NH clinicians to perform the recommended ""diligent monitoring"" of PDDIs, while avoiding alert fatigue. He anticipates that the approach would be generalizable to other prevalent NH ADEs (e.g., delirium) and other drug classes (e.g., mood stabilizers). This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore an innovative approach to managing PDDIs that may ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). It wil also inform an R-series grant proposal to study a mature intervention that Dr. Boyce plans to submit in year 2 of the project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will impact public health by providing quantitative and qualitative pilot data that will inform the design of an intervention that should ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). The work will also provide a solid research basis for future active monitoring interventios targeting a broader set of PDDIs and other adverse events (e.g., delirium) prevalent in the NH setting.",Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr,8974794,K01AG044433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Detection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Group Interviews', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness research', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'hypnotic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prototype', 'sedative', 'therapy design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2016,113592,-0.025429538946663183
"Measuring Inequality in Early Mortality Across All Births in the Developing World Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Antonio Pedro Ramos graduated with a PhD in Political Science in 2015 and an MS in Statistics in 2014, both from UCLA. His dissertation investigated the effects of recent democratization waves on infant and child mortality among the poor in developing countries. In his graduate work, health indicators were used as a tool to test political economy theories, and thus were not the main focus of his analysis. This fellowship will allow Dr. Ramos to obtain the demographic, statistical and health policy expertise to transit from being a political scientist to become a health scholar working with health inequality.  One fundamental dimension of social inequality is inequality in early-life survival. To date, most studies on early-life mortality analyze between-group comparisons, such as income groups within the same country, and they have documented large disparities. While between-group differences are informative they mask important disparities in the mortality risk within groups. Dr Ramos' proposed project is to develop methodologies that (1) can measure inequality in early-life mortality among all births and (2) improve policy targeting by identifying small cells of high risk births that are nested within and across large groups of births.  During the K99 phase, with supervision from his mentors, Dr. Ramos will develop the methodologies that can be used to characterize and explain inequality in early-life mortality across all births and identify high risk births. His methods will be tested on a data set he already acquired that includes records on 5.5 million births from 50 developing countries. In his R00 phase, he will implement large-scale analysis by combining data from multiple sources to produce globals maps of health inequality and high risk births, as well as examine the impact of health policies on reducing child mortality.  UCLA is the ideal place for Dr. Ramos' training and research in public health and applied statistics because of its unique combination of expertise. This includes Dr. Ramos' mentoring team, several other scholars that work on similar topics in various academic centers, classes, seminars, and computational and technical resources that are available at UCLA.  Dr. Ramos is contributing to research and policy practice by developing a methodology that will allow re- searchers and policymakers to measure inequality in early mortality across births and to identify high risk births regardless of their large group membership. By doing so, this project will be the ﬁrst to: 1) draw a time-varying map of total inequality in early mortality across the developing world; 2) identify major correlates of these dispar- ities; and 3) develop more cost effective public health policies. Project Narrative Most studies on early-life mortality compare large groups of births, such as poor and non-poor within countries, and design health interventions to reduce disparities between these groups. These comparisons mask large disparities in mortality risk within births from the same group. The goal of this project is to develop a methodology to measure inequality across births and to better target public health interventions.",Measuring Inequality in Early Mortality Across All Births in the Developing World,9165149,K99HD088727,"['Address', 'Birth', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Child Mortality', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Survey', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disadvantaged', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fellowship', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Infant Mortality', 'International Agencies', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Policy Research', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survey Methodology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'comparison group', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disparity reduction', 'global health', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mortality', 'mortality disparity', 'policy implication', 'public health intervention', 'research study', 'social inequality', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K99,2016,123390,0.03271048224973839
"Role of Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells in the Immune Response to Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surgical trauma produces a profound inflammatory response that, when deregulated, leads to adverse surgical outcomes including protracted recovery, infection, and organ dysfunction. The immune response to surgery involves complex, multi-cellular mechanisms that are poorly understood. The long-term goals of this proposal are to: 1) use a systems-wide approach to enumerate and characterize the major immune cell subsets, on a cell-by-cell basis, from whole blood samples taken from patients undergoing surgery; 2) understand the mechanistic basis of immune-modulatory interventions designed to improve surgical outcomes (e.g., L-arginine supplementation); 3) understand the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity in order to identify specific mechanisms that are critical for patients' recovery from surgery. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gaudilliere will use a next-generation flow cytometry platform (Cytometry by Time of Flight or CyTOF), recently pioneered and brought to practical utility in the laboratory of Dr. Garry Nolan (Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University and primary mentor for this K23 award). Uniting flow cytometry with mass spectrometry enables readouts from rare earth metal isotopes tagged to antibodies. In contrast to traditional fluorescence-based cytometry, the absence of overlap between detection signals allows for a dramatic increase in the number of parameters that can be measured at the single-cell level (currently up to 45). In a pilot study and working under the guidance of Drs. Garry Nolan and Martin Angst (Professor of Anesthesiology, Stanford University), Dr. Gaudilliere established a quantitative and reproducible mass cytometry assay with which to monitor the immune response in patients undergoing hip replacement (i.e., total hip arthroplasty). The data from this study form the groundwork for Dr. Gaudilliere's core hypothesis that Surgery-induced Myeloid Cells (SiMCs) phenocopy MDSCs and suppress the CD8+ T cell adaptive immune response to surgery via an L-arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 1, Dr. Gaudilliere will build an in vitro system to investigate whether SiMCs suppress terminal effector CD8+ T cell (CD8+Teff) function via an L- arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 2, Dr. Gaudilliere proposes a first interventional clinical trial that will use mass cytometry o investigate whether L-arginine supplementation in patients undergoing THA will restore CD8+Teff response in vivo. In Aim 3, Dr. Gaudilliere will adapt and implement statistical tools and learning algorithms (e.g., the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator or LASSO) to investigate whether patient- specific immune features predict surgery-induced expansion of SiMCs and suppression of CD8+Teff cells.  Dr. Gaudilliere is an anesthesiologist at Stanford University School of Medicine with a background in engineering, biochemistry, and molecular biology, and is therefore exceptionally well qualified to address these aims. The Nolan Lab, acknowledged as world-class in the application of mass cytometry to single-cell analysis, will provide Dr. Gaudilliere with the opportunity and environment to acquire the skills for him to become a leading expert in this technology. Furthermore, Dr. Gaudilliere is supported by a multidisciplinary and collaborative team with expertise in signaling biology, human immunology, statistics and bio-informatics, and clinical experimental science and trial design. He will also benefit from the combined strength and resources provided by the Stanford Departments of Anesthesiology, Immunology, and Statistics. To accomplish his research goals and prepare him for a career as an independent investigator, Dr. Gaudilliere has created a multi-disciplinary career development plan incorporating: 1) advanced training in human immunology and immune monitoring with mass cytometry; 2) graduate level didactics in epidemiology and mentored training in clinical study design; and 3) graduate level didactics and mentored training in biostatistics, data mining, and application of machine learning methods for the analysis of complex datasets derived from mass cytometry. In summary, single-cell mass cytometry will be utilized to monitor immune responses to surgery at the systems level in vivo. This approach will not only elucidate specific mechanisms (e.g., arginine-dependent SiMC-mediated suppression of CD8+ T cells) but will also characterize these mechanisms as they occur in the context of the entire immune system. The multidimensional attribute of the data will necessarily generate deeper and potentially more clinically relevant hypotheses than previously posed. The output of this proposal constitutes a data-driven strategy to guide future research efforts and R01 applications to identify patient- specific immune traits predictive of surgical outcomes and explore novel immune-modulatory strategies to improve recovery from surgery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over forty million surgeries are performed annually in the US alone. Surgical trauma produces a profound inflammatory response that is associated with significant co-morbidity including protracted recovery, poor wound healing, infection, and organ dysfunction. Our research addresses this serious public health problem by 1) elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern the immune response of patients undergoing surgery, 2) characterizing the mechanisms by which immune-modulatory therapies improve surgical outcomes, and 3) identifying patient-specific immunologic markers that determine the immune response to surgery.

In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9128789,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Organ failure', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2016,423432,0.03368676261546591
"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma ABSTRACT  This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Comptutational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management. This multidisciplinary project focuses on developing powerful (high-performance) computational, mathematical, and statistical techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous changes from the Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) scans and volumetric Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the optic nerve head. In addition, the Principal Investigator of this proposal will receive extensive training in the areas of computational mathematics and computer vision to augment and strengthen his multidisciplinary expertise essential to execute the proposed specific aims.",New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma,8989994,R00EY020518,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Brain imaging', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastroenterology', 'Generations', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Interferometry', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Eye Institute', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Onset of illness', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visit', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blood flow measurement', 'cancer imaging', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'spectrograph', 'symposium', 'time use']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R00,2016,230028,0.059428189479719784
"Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat Genomes DESCRIPTION: The goal of this BD2K K01 application is to provide Dr. Jeremy W. Prokop with the mentoring and training to be an independent investigator in big data to knowledge. Mentoring and training will be provided to Dr. Prokop in genomics, proteomics, computer science, and statistics to advance his skill to allow for independence. This will allow for further develop of his sequence-to-structure-to-function analysis for interpretation of protein coding genetic variants into a usable workflow available to other scientists. The mentoring throughout this award will be from Dr. Howard Jacob, a leader in rat/human genetics and tool development to understand variants in whole genomes. Additionally, Dr. Andrew Greene serves as a co-mentor to help advance skills in proteomics and Dr. Christina Kendziorski as a co-mentor to advance statistical tools/approaches. The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) is a leader in the use of whole genome sequencing in understanding human health, with a Cap/CLIA certified clinical sequencing facility, tools for identifying genetic variants from whole genomes (such as Carpe Novo), and operation of databases like the Rat Genome Database. These tools and knowledge at MCW will serve as an asset for the training and completion of the Aims in this award. Dr. Prokop's research focus in this grant is to further expand the sequence-to-structure-to-function approaches he developed during his Ph.D. and initial postdoc into a workflow and web submission server for other users. Aim 1 of the grant organizes these steps into a workflow allowing for the development of the web based submission server. To test the workflow, 75 candidate genes for cardiovascular disease will be screened. Initial use of the approach has revealed hypotheses for how genetic variants in Havcr1 and Shroom3 result in altered cardiovascular drug response or disease. Variants in these two proteins will be biochemically characterized using a novel decision tree to standardize experiments (Aim 2) and to serve as a quality control for the approaches of Aim 1. From the results of the 75 screened cardiovascular genes, the four genes with the highest confidence score will be validated using the biochemical decision tree in year four and five of this award serving as an additional quality control for the approaches in Aim 1. This grant will provide the training and support for Dr. Prokop to be integrated into the Medical College of Wisconsin's Clinical Sequencing program, allowing for additional R01 proposals for validation of genetic causes of disease, and facilitate the development of Dr. Prokop into an independent researcher in the use of big data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a new tool package that is able to interpret genetic variants of disease genomes into a testable hypothesis of how protein function is perturbed. This tool will allow for improved diagnostic and treatment methods for many human diseases that employ whole genome/exome sequencing such as cardiovascular, cancer, and rare diseases.",Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat Genomes,9123595,K01ES025435,"['Actins', 'Affinity', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'CLIA certified', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimerization', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Filtration', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lisinopril', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Precipitation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'SFN gene', 'Science of genetics', 'Scientist', 'Serine', 'Source', 'Structural Genes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'clinical sequencing', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'data to knowledge', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic variant', 'genome database', 'genome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'mutant', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'rat genome', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,HUDSON-ALPHA INSTITUTE FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY,K01,2016,98203,0.0386230478901624
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials.

"New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Maha R Farhat, MD is an Instructor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School on the tenure track and a staff physician in the Department of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. She is completing a masters of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health in 5/2015. She has spent the last 4.5 years acquiring skills in Mycobacterium tuberculosis biology, epidemiology, bioinformatics and biostatistics. She has experience in the analysis of whole genome sequence data, drug resistance data and patient clinical outcome data with the focus of identifying Mycobacterium tuberculosis genetic determinants of drug resistance. She has also developed new methods in this area. Dr. Farhat has 11 publications 5 of which are first author including high impact and highly cited work in the journals Nature Genetics, Genome Medicine and the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease. The short term goals of this K01 award are to provide training for Dr. Farhat in critical aspects of data science, computational and evolutionary biology, advanced biostatistics and network science. Dr. Farhat's long term goal is to become a leader in the field of Big Data analysis for infectious diseases. The proposed research as well as the training activities outlined in the proposal will successfully position Dr. Farhat for her first R01 and an independent career as a physician scientist. Environment: Dr. Farhat will perform the interdisciplinary work outlined in this proposal at the distinguished Harvard Departments of Global Health Social Medicine, Biostatistics, Evolutionary biology and the Institute for Quantitative Social Sciences. Dr. Farhat' mentorship team will include two world renowned leaders in the fields of infectious diseases and Big Data, Dr. Megan Murray and Dr. Gary King; and two rising stars in the fields of network Science and evolutionary Biology, Dr. JP Onnela and Dr. Michael Desai. Dr. Murray, the principal mentor on this proposal has mentored over 38 trainees, 9 of which have went on to have independent research careers, and 6 competed successfully for K awards. She is also PI on two recently awarded NIH/NIAID grants a CETR U19 and a TBRU U19 and has over 350 peer reviewed publications. To complement the expertise of her mentors Dr. Farhat will be advised by Dr. Christiani a practicing pulmonary and critical care physician and world renowned researcher in the field of lung and environmental genetics. She will also collaborate and consult with Dr. Merce Crosas, a data scientist, and Dr. Pardis Sabeti, a computational biologist. She will rotate through Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri's bioinformatics laboratory to diversify her exposure to biomedical Big Data. In addition, she will receive formal training in evolutionary biology, Bayesian and mixed-model biostatistics, computer science, leadership skills and grant writing. The collaborative opportunities, intellectual environment and resources available to Dr. Farhat are outstanding. Research: Infectious diseases continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9147601,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'pathogen genome', 'personalized medicine', 'power analysis', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'whole genome']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2016,49355,0.07575555922879708
"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Application ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase IIB application, we propose to commercialize and bring to market EyeArt, a fully automated, high throughput, retinal image analysis based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening tool (which has been developed and already validated in bench tests on very large real-world data) by conducting formal clinical trials and integrating it into several clinical information systems. With its fully automated use, high throughput capability (can analyze several thousands of patient cases in just a few hours), scalable architecture, and ability to seamlessly integrate into clinical workflows, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye care providers. DR is a common microvascular complication of diabetes affecting 80% of all diabetic patients. Even though vision loss due to DR is preventable by early detection and treatment, it is the one of the leading global causes of preventable blindness primarily due to the lack of easy access to eye care providers. Automated DR screening is the only way to make DR screening more accessible to the large and growing population of diabetic patients, currently 29 million in the US and 387 million world-wide and expected to grow to 110 million and 592 million respectively by 2030.  To help reduce risk of DR vision loss in the diabetic population, EyeArt uses advanced image analysis algorithms to make DR screening more efficient, cost-effective, and more accessible. EyeArt has been validated and shown to have high screening sensitivity (safety) and efficacy on multiple large real-world datasets including one with over 54,000 patient cases (and 434,000 images) obtained from EyePACS, a DR telescreening system with over 360 sites in the US and elsewhere. Eyenuk has received ISO 13485 certification as a medical device manufacturer and EyeArt has received CE Marking and is commercially available in Europe. Going forward, we will clinically validate EyeArt in formal clinical trials and integrate it into clinical informatio systems to enable EyeArt's seamless incorporation into existing clinical workflows. This will pave the way for EyeArt's availability to the US DR screening market and reduce the burden on clinical resources by improving health care productivity. This will help increase the DR screening conformance in the diabetic population and thus help in reducing and ultimately eliminating vision loss due to DR through early detection and treatment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeArt, a fully automated, high throughput, retinal image analysis based diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening system will help in screening patients in need of expert care thus making DR screening more efficient, cost- effective, and accessible. EyeArt's integration into EyePACS, a DR telescreening system, will facilitate an expansion of DR screening within the large and expanding EyePACs network of primary care centers in the US and elsewhere. We are also collaborating with Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS) which already uses the EyePACS to deploy our system following clinical validation, in their under-resourced safety net teleretinal screening setup which caters to large disparity populations of LA County. The increased access to DR screening will help reduce and ultimately eliminate vision loss due to DR through early detection and treatment.            ",Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Application,9142236,R44EY026864,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Background Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Blindness', 'Caliber', 'Caring', 'Certification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consult', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Angiopathies', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Europe', 'European', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Italy', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Marketing', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Medical Device', 'Medicine', 'Observational Study', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retinal', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specificity', 'Surrogate Markers', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'cost effective', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'high throughput analysis', 'image processing', 'improved', 'macular edema', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'safety net', 'screening', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2016,984026,0.0830125035872852
"Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this grant proposal is to develop and assess a system to enhance the rational and personalized application of antiplatelet therapy for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, or coronary angioplasty and stenting). This proposal describes a 5 year research and training program designed to provide the candidate, Robert Yeh, the necessary skills and experience to develop an independent academic research career in the conduct of translational cardiovascular outcomes research. Candidate: Dr. Yeh received an MSc in health policy from the London School of Economics, an MD from Harvard Medical School, and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (UCSF) and interventional cardiology (MGH). He is now a junior faculty member at the Massachusetts General Hospital with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. While he has successfully been involved with epidemiologic and secondary data analysis, Dr. Yeh will pursue additional training in the areas of decision analysis, clinical trial conduct and implementation research, and bioinformatics - training which will allow him to translate outcomes research findings into novel interventions which improve patient health. The candidate's long-term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the applied outcomes research that has a broad impact on population health. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Dr. Laura Mauri (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and chief scientific officer of the Harvard Clinical Research Institute (HCRI), and Dr. Sharon- Lise Normand (Co-Mentor), Professor of Health Care Policy at HMS and Vice Chair of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute's Methods Committee. Both are internationally recognized leaders in their respective fields, and provide complementary expertise relevant to the research and training of the candidate. Dr. Mauri has an established track record of successfully leading practice-changing multicenter clinical trials in interventional cardiology, including the NIH/FDA/Industry-sponsored Dual Antiplatelet Theray (DAPT) Study. She has mentored several cardiovascular clinical investigators, including those that have received K awards and R01 funding. Dr. Normand has successfully mentored a large number of successful academic investigators, and is an internationally recognized expert in outcomes and comparative effectiveness research methods used in this proposal. The combined resources of several Harvard Medical School institutions, including HCRI, the Department of Health Care Policy, and the MGH Heart Center will support a rich and productive environment for Dr. Yeh's career development through a combination of didactic training, seminars, weekly research meetings, and conference presentations. Research: In the current era of invasive management of coronary artery disease, balancing the tradeoff between ischemic events and bleeding complications has become integral to decisions regarding the type and duration of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary intervention. In Aim 1, multivariable logistic regression will be used to develop models that can predict bleeding and ischemic events in patients after PCI depending on antiplatelet strategy, using data from the DAPT Study, the largest PCI clinical trial conducted to date, and the Massachusetts PCI Registry, a comprehensive longitudinal registry of patients undergoing coronary intervention. Models that can predict treatment benefit or harm associated with specific strategies will be developed. In Aim 2, decision analysis methods will be employed to enhance these models such that the treatment strategy which is predicted to maximize patient benefit can be identified for all patients, and associated uncertainty in this determination can be assessed. In Aim 3, these tools will be integrated into a novel software application that can execute multivariable risk predictions at the point of care within the MGH cardiac catheterization laboratory. These tools will be used as clinical decision aids, and tested in a prospective randomized clinical trial to determine whether such interventions can enhance clinical decision making. The research will demonstrate how the end products of outcomes research can be translated into innovative interventions that can ""personalize"" medical decisions and ultimately improve patient care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stenting of the heart arteries is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the US. Patients who have these procedures are at risk for having both bleeding and clot-related complications during the procedure as well as for months to years afterwards, which require the careful use of antiplatelet medications. This research will develop and assess the impact of tools that can be used by clinicians and patients to help inform the best use of antiplatelet medications after stenting of the heart arteries, such that bleeding and clotting risks associated with these procedures can be minimized for patients.",Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio,9216363,K23HL118138,"['Accounting', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Analysis', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'London', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'alternative treatment', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'coronary angioplasty', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'percutaneous coronary intervention', 'point of care', 'population health', 'professor', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'routine care', 'routine practice', 'skills', 'study population', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'usability']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2016,164376,0.07984698180966171
"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this small business innovations research (SBIR) project we present EyeArt, a retinal image analysis tool for automated diabetic retinopathy (DR) screenings with high diag- nostic efficacy. With its interface to EyePACS, a license-free, scalable telemedicine plat- form, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye-care providers. Research suggests that the Latino population in general are genetically predisposed to develop diabetes. Their vulnerability to vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy is further compounded by factors such as lack of access to ophthalmology clinicians, lack of insurance, and lack of education. According to the Department of Health Services (DHS) in Los Angeles County (LAC) the situation for diabetics is particularly grim, with current wait times upwards of 6-9 months for retinal examinations for retinopathy screening. This can lead to treatment delays and progression towards irreversible vision loss. To help reduce risk of vision loss in this diabetic population, we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening, allow reprioritizatin of ophthalmologist appointments, and aid in triage of high-risk patients. Our phase I prototype automatic DR screening tool has already shown great potential by beating current academic and commercial DR screening ap- proaches on large public retinal datasets. Going forward, we will build on our approach and further develop innovative, customized algorithms for critical low-level image processing steps, while leveraging on recent advances in computer vision, and machine learning areas for high-level, inference steps to produce a clinical grade DR screening tool. Our lesion localization and screening engine will be functionally integrated with EyePACS to further drive the expansion of screening, particularly benefiting under- resourced screening programs like the LAC-DHS safety net and its large Hispanic diabetic population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeArt - an automated retinal image analysis tool will help in triaging patients in need of expert care and thus reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening, while leading to an expansion of screening in primary care centers through its easily accessible telemedicine interface. This increased access to DR care will help prevent vision loss due to diabetes complications in vulnerable disparity populations such as Latinos who do not get screened due to socio-economic factors. To make an immediate impact we are collaborating with Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS) to deploy our system, following clinical validation, in their under-resourced safety net teleretinal screening setup whic caters to large disparity populations of LA County.",Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications,8891422,R44EB013585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Background Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Color', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consult', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Economic Factors', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Insurance', 'International', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'ROC Curve', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2015,394177,0.024349678062076517
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,8920669,R00LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'memory process', 'model building', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R00,2015,239130,0.030769479178070748
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8788442,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2015,129546,0.023393199504497864
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications. PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease.

The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8875578,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'diagnostic assay', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2015,137160,0.070030635508109
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,8921191,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2015,159162,0.09610208573668352
"Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 career development award resubmission for Dr. Ryan Stidham, a gastroenterologist at the University of Michigan. Dr. Stidham's long-term career goal is to develop objective prognostics to personalize treatment decisions for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The immediate goals of the proposal are to evaluate both analytic morphomics, an image analysis platform to quantify CT scan findings, and serum glycoproteomic profiles to predict therapeutic response in patients with Crohn's disease. Dr. Stidham's integrated research and career development plan align with goals of developing himself as a collaborative translational investigator, skilled in statistical analysis o large datasets, applying novel prognostics to improve clinical outcomes in Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease (CD) affects over 700,000 patients in the United States. Nearly 60% of CD patients require surgical resection for medically-unresponsive disease within 10 years of diagnosis. Frequently, patients present with deep bowel injury composed of both medically-responsive inflammatory and non- responsive fibrotic injury. Despite the presence of an inflammatory target, medical therapy may be futile and timely surgical management should be pursued. Further, strategies using early high-intensity immunosuppression to prevent future fibrostenotic disease are likely to over treat portions of the CD population. Therefore, therapeutic decisions are predicated on (1) the probability that existing disease activity will respond to medical therapy and (2) the probability of developing future fibrostenotic complications. Assessment using colonoscopy and surrogates of inflammation including imaging, blood, and stool-based biomarkers fail to provide comprehensive and quantitative assessments of bowel injury, including fibrosis. Despite its importance, there are no measures to account for deep bowel wall injury and intestinal fibrosis. This research proposal will utilize quantitative imaging findings of deep bowel injury in conjunction with blood-based biomarkers reflecting disease phenotypes to predict medical failure, defined as requiring future bowel resection, hospitalization, and prolonged steroid use. To achieve our imaging aims (Aim 1) we will use analytic morphomics, a computer image analysis method, to quantify body and bowel composition from over 4,000 CT-enterographies in a longitudinal 1200 patient CD cohort. In Aim 2, serum glycoproteome variance will be characterized in carefully phenotyped inflammatory and stricturing subjects to refine our preexisting biomarkers of fibrosis. We have demonstrated that variations of the serum glycoproteome reflect the degree of intestinal fibrosis present and expect that serum glycoproteomics can differentiate inflammatory from fibrotic phenotypes in CD. Optimized serum glycoproteome profiles will be used to predict future conversion from B1- inflammatory disease to B2/3 fibrostenotic disease in a pediatric prospective-inception cohort (RISK study). Aim 3 entails a prospective study combining analytic morphomics and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict therapeutic response and clinical outcomes; providing preliminary data for future R03/R01 studies. Dr. Stidham is a Lecturer of Medicine at the University of Michigan Division of Gastroenterology. He earned his medical degree from the University of Virginia (AOA), completed an internal medicine residency at the University of Pennsylvania, and was a T-32 research fellow at the University of Michigan (2011). His research background combines laboratory and clinical experience with Dr. Peter Higgins (primary mentor), focusing on novel biomarker development. Dr. Stidham has been awarded several prior grants for pilot work, including a MICHR-CTSA T32 Pilot Grant for Proteomics and a Crohn's and Colitis Foundation Career Development Award for ultrasound imaging research. He is in the process of completing a Masters program in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis at the University of Michigan School of Public Health (matriculation in April 2015). He has published in several gastroenterology journals, presented research internationally, and has built the independent collaborations featured in this proposal. Central to this career development award, the candidate will leverage the expertise of several mentors and collaborators to develop deep foundational skillsets in analytic imaging, translational proteomics, bioinformatics, and machine learning methods. The University of Michigan houses a nationally recognized Inflammatory Bowel Disease Program, internationally recognized proteomics expertise, and a dedicated Analytic Morphomics Group focused on computational image analysis of organs. The mentored research training will be supplemented with focused graduate-level coursework in bioinformatics, medical image analysis, machine learning methodologies, and decision support systems provided through the University of Michigan Center for Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics and the School of Public Health. The Division of Gastroenterology and Department of Medicine have a history of strong support for Dr. Stidham and will provide the time, resources, and mentorship necessary to achieve his professional and research goals. The training provided through this career development award will be pivotal for the candidate's development as an independent translational investigator focused on individualizing therapeutic management. This research will provide the foundation for future collaborative studies to further develop these and other prognostic tools for the inflammatory bowel diseases.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work evaluates the capabilities of quantitative image analysis and serum glycoproteome profiles to predict the probability of medical response in Crohn's disease. Improved prediction of therapeutic response would tailor Crohn's disease management such that patients unlikely to benefit from medical therapy can proceed to timely surgical management and be spared the risks and costs of modern immunosuppressive treatments.        ",Improving Prediction of Medical Responsiveness and Clinical Outcomes in Crohn's Disease,8968013,K23DK101687,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Colonoscopy', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Fibrosis', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gastroenterologist', 'Gastroenterology', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitalization', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunosuppression', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Influentials', 'Injury', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intestinal Fibrosis', 'Intestines', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Morphology', 'Mucositis', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Residencies', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Serum', 'Steroids', 'Surgical Management', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'cost', 'digital imaging', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'improved', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'lecturer', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'programs', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K23,2015,181860,0.09745856111719219
"Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains a menace for human health for the lack of any effective treatment. HCC is usually the end result of chronic liver diseases associated with diverse risk factors. Furthermore, non- alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) induced HCC, which is projected to be the leading cause of new cases, remains poorly characterized. Although many mouse models of HCC have been developed, it is unclear how well they represent different subgroups of human HCCs. This research plan proposes to transform HCC animal modeling by establishing a novel in vivo platform to accurately replicate the somatic molecular profiles of human HCC in mice. To do this, three independent HCC mouse models will be exhaustively characterized through exome sequencing and gene expression profiling. Using bioinformatics techniques including machine- learning and network analysis, these datasets will be compared with human HCC datasets from TCGA and the ICGC to identify subgroups of patients with similar somatic molecular profiles to the HCC mouse models as well as refined minimum sets of characteristic genetic aberrations. A derived transposon system will be used to generate mosaic mouse models replicating human HCC genetic subgroups faithfully. These models will enable 1) experimental dissection of the molecular mechanisms underlying distinct etiologies of HCC, 2) systematic assessment of candidate HCC therapies and 3) investigation of therapeutic resistances. This K99/R00 career development award proposal describes a two-year mentored and three-year independent research program essential for the development of Dr. Font-Burgada as an independent investigator. Dr. Font-Burgada received his PhD at University of Barcelona, Spain, for the work he performed to investigate basic chromatin regulatory and epigenetic mechanisms. He then moved to University of California, San Diego where he joined Dr. Michael Karin's laboratory to train in mouse models of cancer and signal transduction. For the accomplishment of this research proposal, Dr. Font-Burgada has designed a strong training and career development plan consisting of: 1- the continued mentorship of Dr. Michael Karin to gain additional expertise in mouse models of HCC and signal transduction, 2- Training in bioinformatics, specifically in methods to identify cancer driver genetic aberrations and network-based approaches for comparative genomic analysis of mouse and human HCCs, to be overseen by co-mentor Dr. Hannah Carter, an Assistant Professor of Medicine, at UCSD. 3- Training in application of emerging transposon vector technologies to generate mosaic mouse models for in vivo analysis of oncogenic pathways. 4- Career development courses and seminars in a supportive academic environment in the Department of Pharmacology at UCSD to complement other aspects of the training program. This training plan will be overseen by an advisory committee comprising 4 members, mentor, co-mentor, and additional experts in mouse models of cancer and bioinformatics, Inder Verma and Trey Ideker, providing key scientific insights and essential guidance in critical steps in Dr. Font-Burgada transition to independence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% and leads to 700000 deaths globally each year. The genetic causes of this disease are poorly understood and the only available targeted therapy extends life expectancy by a mere 3 months. In order to improve these dismal statistics, I am developing a novel class of mouse models capable of reproducing the spectrum of mutations observed in a given human tumor, to enable study of HCC biology as well as systematic testing of therapeutic combinations.",Development of mosaic mouse models of HCC for genetic interspecies inference,8805692,K99CA191152,"['Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'BRAF gene', 'Beauty', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'California', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Genomic Analysis', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diet', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Targeting', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hepatocyte', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Human Pathology', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Mouse Protein', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Mutation Spectra', 'Network-based', 'Oncogenic', 'Orthologous Gene', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Spain', 'Subgroup', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transgenes', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'Xenograft Model', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'career development', 'chronic liver disease', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exome sequencing', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'professor', 'programs', 'response', 'statistics', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'vector']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2015,109620,0.07030917449182256
"Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Richard D. Boyce, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has training in informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research as well as a strong commitment to improving medication safety for older adults. His prior work has focused on artificial intelligence methods for predicting drug-drug interactions and the comparative safety of antidepressants for treating de-pressed nursing home residents. The current proposal is for a three year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that will address gaps in his knowledge of aging research and the nursing home setting. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Charles Reynolds, Jordan Karp, and Steven Handler) he has developed a training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on how to effectively translate research results from pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research to informatics interventions that improve medication safety for older adults, especially nursing home residents. To accomplish this goal, he proposes eight career development activities and two research aims that will help him 1) obtain rigorous training in the science and practice of creating clinical decision support interventions that are effective in the nursing home setting; 2) obtain a thorough understanding of how falls and fall risk factors are detected, monitored, reported, and assessed in the nursing home setting; and 3) learn the perceptions of multiple nursing home clinician stakeholders on what research is needed to help reduce medication-related adverse events. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by exploring the feasibility and potential clinical usefulness of actively monitoring patients exposed to psycho- tropic PDDIs. The approach would use electronic data available in most United States (US) NHs to provide highly specific and actionable alerts to physicians and/or nurses when a resident who is exposed to a PDDI involving a psychotropic drug transitions to a state of unacceptably high risk for experiencing a fall. Dr. Boyce's hypothesis is that this approach will extend the ability of NH clinicians to perform the recommended ""diligent monitoring"" of PDDIs, while avoiding alert fatigue. He anticipates that the approach would be generalizable to other prevalent NH ADEs (e.g., delirium) and other drug classes (e.g., mood stabilizers). This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore an innovative approach to managing PDDIs that may ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). It wil also inform an R-series grant proposal to study a mature intervention that Dr. Boyce plans to submit in year 2 of the project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will impact public health by providing quantitative and qualitative pilot data that will inform the design of an intervention that should ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). The work will also provide a solid research basis for future active monitoring interventios targeting a broader set of PDDIs and other adverse events (e.g., delirium) prevalent in the NH setting.",Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr,8776906,K01AG044433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Detection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Group Interviews', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness research', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'hypnotic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'prototype', 'sedative', 'therapy design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2015,114082,-0.025429538946663183
"Role of Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells in the Immune Response to Surgery DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surgical trauma produces a profound inflammatory response that, when deregulated, leads to adverse surgical outcomes including protracted recovery, infection, and organ dysfunction. The immune response to surgery involves complex, multi-cellular mechanisms that are poorly understood. The long-term goals of this proposal are to: 1) use a systems-wide approach to enumerate and characterize the major immune cell subsets, on a cell-by-cell basis, from whole blood samples taken from patients undergoing surgery; 2) understand the mechanistic basis of immune-modulatory interventions designed to improve surgical outcomes (e.g., L-arginine supplementation); 3) understand the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity in order to identify specific mechanisms that are critical for patients' recovery from surgery. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gaudilliere will use a next-generation flow cytometry platform (Cytometry by Time of Flight or CyTOF), recently pioneered and brought to practical utility in the laboratory of Dr. Garry Nolan (Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University and primary mentor for this K23 award). Uniting flow cytometry with mass spectrometry enables readouts from rare earth metal isotopes tagged to antibodies. In contrast to traditional fluorescence-based cytometry, the absence of overlap between detection signals allows for a dramatic increase in the number of parameters that can be measured at the single-cell level (currently up to 45). In a pilot study and working under the guidance of Drs. Garry Nolan and Martin Angst (Professor of Anesthesiology, Stanford University), Dr. Gaudilliere established a quantitative and reproducible mass cytometry assay with which to monitor the immune response in patients undergoing hip replacement (i.e., total hip arthroplasty). The data from this study form the groundwork for Dr. Gaudilliere's core hypothesis that Surgery-induced Myeloid Cells (SiMCs) phenocopy MDSCs and suppress the CD8+ T cell adaptive immune response to surgery via an L-arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 1, Dr. Gaudilliere will build an in vitro system to investigate whether SiMCs suppress terminal effector CD8+ T cell (CD8+Teff) function via an L- arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 2, Dr. Gaudilliere proposes a first interventional clinical trial that will use mass cytometry o investigate whether L-arginine supplementation in patients undergoing THA will restore CD8+Teff response in vivo. In Aim 3, Dr. Gaudilliere will adapt and implement statistical tools and learning algorithms (e.g., the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator or LASSO) to investigate whether patient- specific immune features predict surgery-induced expansion of SiMCs and suppression of CD8+Teff cells.  Dr. Gaudilliere is an anesthesiologist at Stanford University School of Medicine with a background in engineering, biochemistry, and molecular biology, and is therefore exceptionally well qualified to address these aims. The Nolan Lab, acknowledged as world-class in the application of mass cytometry to single-cell analysis, will provide Dr. Gaudilliere with the opportunity and environment to acquire the skills for him to become a leading expert in this technology. Furthermore, Dr. Gaudilliere is supported by a multidisciplinary and collaborative team with expertise in signaling biology, human immunology, statistics and bio-informatics, and clinical experimental science and trial design. He will also benefit from the combined strength and resources provided by the Stanford Departments of Anesthesiology, Immunology, and Statistics. To accomplish his research goals and prepare him for a career as an independent investigator, Dr. Gaudilliere has created a multi-disciplinary career development plan incorporating: 1) advanced training in human immunology and immune monitoring with mass cytometry; 2) graduate level didactics in epidemiology and mentored training in clinical study design; and 3) graduate level didactics and mentored training in biostatistics, data mining, and application of machine learning methods for the analysis of complex datasets derived from mass cytometry. In summary, single-cell mass cytometry will be utilized to monitor immune responses to surgery at the systems level in vivo. This approach will not only elucidate specific mechanisms (e.g., arginine-dependent SiMC-mediated suppression of CD8+ T cells) but will also characterize these mechanisms as they occur in the context of the entire immune system. The multidimensional attribute of the data will necessarily generate deeper and potentially more clinically relevant hypotheses than previously posed. The output of this proposal constitutes a data-driven strategy to guide future research efforts and R01 applications to identify patient- specific immune traits predictive of surgical outcomes and explore novel immune-modulatory strategies to improve recovery from surgery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over forty million surgeries are performed annually in the US alone. Surgical trauma produces a profound inflammatory response that is associated with significant co-morbidity including protracted recovery, poor wound healing, infection, and organ dysfunction. Our research addresses this serious public health problem by 1) elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern the immune response of patients undergoing surgery, 2) characterizing the mechanisms by which immune-modulatory therapies improve surgical outcomes, and 3) identifying patient-specific immunologic markers that determine the immune response to surgery. Knowledge gained from this research is foundational for identifying immune markers that predict recovery from surgery in individual patients and for advancing therapeutic strategies that will improve recovery.",Role of Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells in the Immune Response to Surgery,8911350,K23GM111657,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesiology', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Arginine', 'Arthroplasty', 'Attenuated', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biometry', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Eragrostis', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Immunologic Monitoring', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Isotopes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mus', 'Myelogenous', 'Myeloid Cell Suppression', 'Myeloid Cells', 'Natural Immunity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Phenocopy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Placebos', 'Postoperative Period', 'Proteins', 'Public Health', 'Qualifying', 'RNA Interference', 'Randomized', 'Rare Earth Metals', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stat5 protein', 'Supplementation', 'Suppressor-Effector T-Lymphocytes', 'Surface', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'Wound Healing', 'adaptive immunity', 'arginase', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'data mining', 'design', 'hip replacement arthroplasty', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'monocyte', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'primary outcome', 'professor', 'response', 'single cell analysis', 'skills', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'trait', 'trial design']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,130988,0.027404196561236896
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9085705,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'programs', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'success', 'translational medicine']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2015,388145,0.03368676261546591
"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma ABSTRACT  This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Comptutational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management. This multidisciplinary project focuses on developing powerful (high-performance) computational, mathematical, and statistical techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous changes from the Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) scans and volumetric Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the optic nerve head. In addition, the Principal Investigator of this proposal will receive extensive training in the areas of computational mathematics and computer vision to augment and strengthen his multidisciplinary expertise essential to execute the proposed specific aims.",New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma,8798661,R00EY020518,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Brain imaging', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastroenterology', 'Generations', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Interferometry', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Eye Institute', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Onset of illness', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visit', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blood flow measurement', 'cancer imaging', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'spectrograph', 'symposium', 'time use']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R00,2015,228148,0.059428189479719784
"Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat Genomes DESCRIPTION: The goal of this BD2K K01 application is to provide Dr. Jeremy W. Prokop with the mentoring and training to be an independent investigator in big data to knowledge. Mentoring and training will be provided to Dr. Prokop in genomics, proteomics, computer science, and statistics to advance his skill to allow for independence. This will allow for further develop of his sequence-to-structure-to-function analysis for interpretation of protein coding genetic variants into a usable workflow available to other scientists. The mentoring throughout this award will be from Dr. Howard Jacob, a leader in rat/human genetics and tool development to understand variants in whole genomes. Additionally, Dr. Andrew Greene serves as a co-mentor to help advance skills in proteomics and Dr. Christina Kendziorski as a co-mentor to advance statistical tools/approaches. The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) is a leader in the use of whole genome sequencing in understanding human health, with a Cap/CLIA certified clinical sequencing facility, tools for identifying genetic variants from whole genomes (such as Carpe Novo), and operation of databases like the Rat Genome Database. These tools and knowledge at MCW will serve as an asset for the training and completion of the Aims in this award. Dr. Prokop's research focus in this grant is to further expand the sequence-to-structure-to-function approaches he developed during his Ph.D. and initial postdoc into a workflow and web submission server for other users. Aim 1 of the grant organizes these steps into a workflow allowing for the development of the web based submission server. To test the workflow, 75 candidate genes for cardiovascular disease will be screened. Initial use of the approach has revealed hypotheses for how genetic variants in Havcr1 and Shroom3 result in altered cardiovascular drug response or disease. Variants in these two proteins will be biochemically characterized using a novel decision tree to standardize experiments (Aim 2) and to serve as a quality control for the approaches of Aim 1. From the results of the 75 screened cardiovascular genes, the four genes with the highest confidence score will be validated using the biochemical decision tree in year four and five of this award serving as an additional quality control for the approaches in Aim 1. This grant will provide the training and support for Dr. Prokop to be integrated into the Medical College of Wisconsin's Clinical Sequencing program, allowing for additional R01 proposals for validation of genetic causes of disease, and facilitate the development of Dr. Prokop into an independent researcher in the use of big data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a new tool package that is able to interpret genetic variants of disease genomes into a testable hypothesis of how protein function is perturbed. This tool will allow for improved diagnostic and treatment methods for many human diseases that employ whole genome/exome sequencing such as cardiovascular, cancer, and rare diseases.",Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat Genomes,9108532,K01ES025435,"['Actins', 'Affinity', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimerization', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Filtration', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lisinopril', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Precipitation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science of genetics', 'Scientist', 'Serine', 'Source', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'clinical sequencing', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic variant', 'genome database', 'genome sequencing', 'human SFN protein', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'mutant', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'rat genome', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIEHS,HUDSON-ALPHA INSTITUTE FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY,K01,2015,98203,0.0386230478901624
"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8897359,K23DK090304,"['Academy', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,37402,0.04727998135461611
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD.

Despite the availability of effective antimicrobials, pathogens are successfully evolving new disease phenotypes that allow them to resist killing by these drugs or in other instances cause more severe disease manifestations or wider chains of transmission. Drug resistance (DR) is now common and some bacteria have even become resistant to multiple types or classes of antibiotics6. A key strategy in the fight against emerging pathogen phenotypes in infectious diseases is surveillance, and early personalized therapy to prevent transmission and propagation of these strains. The timely initiation of antibiotic therapy to which the pathogen is sensitive has been shown to be the key factor influencing treatment outcome for a diverse array of infections. Molecular tests that rely on the detection of microbial genetic mutations are particularly promising for surveillance and diagnosis of these pathogen phenotypes but rely on a comprehensive understanding of how mutations associate with these pathogen phenotypes. Currently there is an explosion of data on pathogen whole genome sequences (WGS) that is increasingly generated from clinical laboratories. Data on disease phenotype may also be available, but methods for the analysis and interpretation of these Big Data are lagging. Here I propose tools to aid in this analysis leveraging Big Data sets from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and my prior work. Specifically I propose to (1) develop a web-based public interface to several analysis tools, including a statistical learning model that can predict the MTB DR phenotype from its genomic sequence, (2) to develop and study an MTB gene-gene network, based on WGS data, to improve our understanding of the effect of mutation-mutation interactions on the DR phenotype, and (3) study the performance of methods in current use for the association of genotype and phenotype in pathogens, and develop a generalizable power calculator for the best performing method.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Infectious agents of disease are successfully evolving drug resistance and other adaptations that threaten human health. Understanding the genetic mutations that underlie these disease phenotypes can inform surveillance and diagnostic strategies to combat this threat. Here I propose to develop accessible tools for pathogen genomic analysis that will help identify which genetic mutations are relevant to disease.                ",New Tools for the interpretation of Pathogen Genomic Data with a focus on Mycobacterium tuberculosis,9044227,K01ES026835,"['Affect', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complement', 'Computational Science', 'Consult', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Drug resistance in tuberculosis', 'Drug-sensitive', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Explosion', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Gene Structure', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Infectious Agent', 'Infectious Diseases Research', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Journals', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Leadership', 'Low income', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microbial Genetics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogeny', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Social Medicine', 'Social Sciences', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Virulent', 'Work', 'Writing', 'analytical tool', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'combat', 'computer science', 'design', 'disease phenotype', 'experience', 'fight against', 'gene interaction', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'global health', 'improved', 'instructor', 'killings', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'mortality', 'pathogen', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIEHS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2015,230806,0.07575555922879708
"Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this grant proposal is to develop and assess a system to enhance the rational and personalized application of antiplatelet therapy for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, or coronary angioplasty and stenting). This proposal describes a 5 year research and training program designed to provide the candidate, Robert Yeh, the necessary skills and experience to develop an independent academic research career in the conduct of translational cardiovascular outcomes research. Candidate: Dr. Yeh received an MSc in health policy from the London School of Economics, an MD from Harvard Medical School, and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (UCSF) and interventional cardiology (MGH). He is now a junior faculty member at the Massachusetts General Hospital with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. While he has successfully been involved with epidemiologic and secondary data analysis, Dr. Yeh will pursue additional training in the areas of decision analysis, clinical trial conduct and implementation research, and bioinformatics - training which will allow him to translate outcomes research findings into novel interventions which improve patient health. The candidate's long-term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the applied outcomes research that has a broad impact on population health. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Dr. Laura Mauri (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and chief scientific officer of the Harvard Clinical Research Institute (HCRI), and Dr. Sharon- Lise Normand (Co-Mentor), Professor of Health Care Policy at HMS and Vice Chair of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute's Methods Committee. Both are internationally recognized leaders in their respective fields, and provide complementary expertise relevant to the research and training of the candidate. Dr. Mauri has an established track record of successfully leading practice-changing multicenter clinical trials in interventional cardiology, including the NIH/FDA/Industry-sponsored Dual Antiplatelet Theray (DAPT) Study. She has mentored several cardiovascular clinical investigators, including those that have received K awards and R01 funding. Dr. Normand has successfully mentored a large number of successful academic investigators, and is an internationally recognized expert in outcomes and comparative effectiveness research methods used in this proposal. The combined resources of several Harvard Medical School institutions, including HCRI, the Department of Health Care Policy, and the MGH Heart Center will support a rich and productive environment for Dr. Yeh's career development through a combination of didactic training, seminars, weekly research meetings, and conference presentations. Research: In the current era of invasive management of coronary artery disease, balancing the tradeoff between ischemic events and bleeding complications has become integral to decisions regarding the type and duration of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary intervention. In Aim 1, multivariable logistic regression will be used to develop models that can predict bleeding and ischemic events in patients after PCI depending on antiplatelet strategy, using data from the DAPT Study, the largest PCI clinical trial conducted to date, and the Massachusetts PCI Registry, a comprehensive longitudinal registry of patients undergoing coronary intervention. Models that can predict treatment benefit or harm associated with specific strategies will be developed. In Aim 2, decision analysis methods will be employed to enhance these models such that the treatment strategy which is predicted to maximize patient benefit can be identified for all patients, and associated uncertainty in this determination can be assessed. In Aim 3, these tools will be integrated into a novel software application that can execute multivariable risk predictions at the point of care within the MGH cardiac catheterization laboratory. These tools will be used as clinical decision aids, and tested in a prospective randomized clinical trial to determine whether such interventions can enhance clinical decision making. The research will demonstrate how the end products of outcomes research can be translated into innovative interventions that can ""personalize"" medical decisions and ultimately improve patient care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stenting of the heart arteries is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the US. Patients who have these procedures are at risk for having both bleeding and clot-related complications during the procedure as well as for months to years afterwards, which require the careful use of antiplatelet medications. This research will develop and assess the impact of tools that can be used by clinicians and patients to help inform the best use of antiplatelet medications after stenting of the heart arteries, such that bleeding and clotting risks associated with these procedures can be minimized for patients.",Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio,8842697,K23HL118138,"['Accounting', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Analysis', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'London', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'alternative treatment', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'coronary angioplasty', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'percutaneous coronary intervention', 'point of care', 'population health', 'professor', 'prospective', 'racial and ethnic', 'routine care', 'routine practice', 'skills', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2015,137160,0.07984698180966171
"Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications  Abstract In this small business innovations research (SBIR) project we present EyeArt, a retinal image analysis tool for automated diabetic retinopathy (DR) screenings with high diag- nostic efficacy. With its interface to EyePACS, a license-free, scalable telemedicine plat- form, EyeArt will aid the expansion of DR screening and help bridge the exponentially growing disparity between the number of diabetic patients and the number of eye-care providers. Research suggests that the Latino population in general are genetically predisposed to develop diabetes. Their vulnerability to vision loss due to diabetic retinopathy is further compounded by factors such as lack of access to ophthalmology clinicians, lack of in- surance, and lack of education. According to the Department of Health Services (DHS) in Los Angeles County (LAC) the situation for diabetics is particularly grim, with current wait times upwards of 6-9 months for retinal examinations for retinopathy screening. This can lead to treatment delays and progression towards irreversible vision loss. To help reduce risk of vision loss in this diabetic population, we propose to use advanced image analysis algorithms in conjunction with existing telemedicine initiatives to enable faster screening, allow reprioritization of ophthalmologist appointments, and aid in triage of high-risk patients. Our phase I prototype automatic DR screening tool has already shown great potential by beating current academic and commercial DR screening ap- proaches on large public retinal datasets. Going forward, we will build on our approach and further develop innovative, customized algorithms for critical low-level image pro- cessing steps, while leveraging on recent advances in computer vision, and machine learning areas for high-level, inference steps to produce a clinical grade DR screening tool. Our lesion localization and screening engine will be functionally integrated with EyePACS to further drive the expansion of screening, particularly benefiting under- resourced screening programs like the LAC-DHS safety net and its large Hispanic dia- betic population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeArt - an automated retinal image analysis tool will help in triaging patients in need of expert care and thus reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening, while leading to an expansion of screening in primary care centers through its easily accessible telemedicine interface. This increased access to DR care will help prevent vision loss due to diabetes complications in vulnerable disparity populations such as Latinos who do not get screened due to socio-economic factors. To make an immediate impact we are collaborating with Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (LAC-DHS) to deploy our system, following clinical validation, in their under-resourced safety net teleretinal screening setup whic caters to large disparity populations of LA County.            ",Advanced Image Analysis Tools for Diabetic Retinopathy Telemedicine Applications,8740363,R44EB013585,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Background Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Blindness', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Color', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consult', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Economic Factors', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Hispanics', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Insurance', 'International', 'Latino', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Licensing', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'ROC Curve', 'Reader', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'safety net', 'screening', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NIBIB,"EYENUK, INC.",R44,2014,394542,0.02514454091516891
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,8916335,R00LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Simulate', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'memory process', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R00,2014,246867,0.030769479178070748
"Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This career transition award will provide the applicant with protected research time to develop an independent research career in biomedical informatics. Dr. Starkey received his M.D. in 2003 from UT Southwestern, completed the NLM Biomedical Informatics Training Program post-doctoral fellowship in 2011 and earned a Ph.D. focusing on clinical informatics from the Clinical Sciences Degree Program at the University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB) at Galveston in 2012. Dr. Starkey accepted a faculty position at the Institute for Translational Sciences at UTMB that is currently supporting his transition to independent investigator. Dr. Starkey will utilize the career transition award for novel applications of advanced machine learning methods to create predictive models of disease. Predictive models of disease allow for the stratification of risk and prevention of disease and have been successfully implemented in the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk. Predictive models of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are an active area of research since CKD is a risk factor for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death and end-stage renal disease. However, there is not a single predictive model of CKD created for application to Hispanics and the external validity of existing models is poor. The objective of this project is to create predictive models of chronic kidney disease in a Hispanic population and quantify biomarkers of chronic kidney disease using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) proteomics in this minority population. MRM proteomics will utilize the UTMB Novel Methodologies core and its array of resources to create an inter-institutional collaboration. Heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods will be used to create the predictive model of chronic kidney disease in the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (CCHC). Established in 2004, the CCHC is a random population sample in Brownsville, Texas created to evaluate the determinants of health in a US/Mexico border population that is primarily of Hispanic ethnicity. The CCHC has an extremely high prevalence of obesity and diabetes at 49.7% and 30.3%, respectively. Both obesity and diabetes are independent risk factors for the development of CKD and represent significant health disparities in the Hispanic population. Archived serum samples of CCHC participants and the CCHC database will be utilized to complete the following aims: 1) Create predictive models of CKD in a Hispanic population 2) Refine the predictive models by including clinical laboratory data and a selective reaction monitoring mass spectrometry panel of biomarkers. At the completion of this project, predictive models of CKD applicable to a Hispanic population will be created and MRM proteomics will demonstrate utility of biomarkers identified in other populations. The application of the results will be used to create clinical tools for CKD risk and guide future studies in this Hispanic population with health disparities. Importantly, it will provide a career transition for D. Starkey to demonstrate the knowledge gained during his training that results in impactful research and publications.              PROJECT NARRATIVE:  The proposed research is relevant to public health because it allows stratification of chronic kidney disease risk and quantifies biomarkers of chronic kidney disease in the Hispanic minority whom has significant health disparities with regard to kidney disease. The translation of selective reaction monitoring of biomarkers and development of heterogeneous ensemble machine learning methods for application to the prediction of chronic kidney disease in a minority population supports the NLM mission.",Predictive Model of Chronic Kidney Disease in a Hispanic Population,8700987,K22LM011869,"['Age', 'Albumins', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Faculty', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Household', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mexican', 'Mexico', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Reaction', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Specimen', 'Stratification', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'innovation', 'medically underserved', 'mortality', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'urinary']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,K22,2014,132121,0.030049537184180134
"Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In-hospital cardiac arrest (IHCA) is a significant public health problem, afflicting over 200,000 patients in the United States annually with a mortality rate of approximately 80%. The majority of these patients show signs of clinical deterioration in the hours before the event. This has led to the development of vital sign-based early warning scores designed to detect high-risk patients before IHCA to trigger life-saving interventions. However, the vast majority of these risk scores were created subjectively in individual hospitals and have shown limited accuracy for detecting adverse outcomes. Developing an accurate risk score to detect patients at highest risk of IHCA is essential to decreasing preventable in-hospital death. In my prior work, I completed several studies investigating the accuracy of vital signs for predicting IHCA. These studies, previous literature, and my preliminary data have resulted in the following conclusions: 1) statistically developed risk scores are more accurate than previously published risk scores, 2) multicenter data is needed to create the most accurate and generalizable risk score, 3) additional data, such as laboratory results, will likely improve the accuracy of risk scores, and 4) a cutting-edge method for developing prediction models, called machine learning, may result in more accurate risk scores. Importantly, significant improvement in accuracy leads to better identification of patients at highest risk of IHCA and decreased resource utilization. Therefore, in this grant proposal I aim to develop and validate IHCA prediction models using different statistical techniques in a multicenter database and then estimate the impact of the most accurate risk score using simulation studies. I will do this by firt developing prediction models using classic survival analysis methods (Aim 1a) and machine learning methods, such as neural networks and decision trees (Aim 1b). Then, I will compare the models I develop to the most accurate previously published risk scores in Aim 2. Finally, I will investigate the impact of the most accurate model from Aim 2 on patient outcomes using simulation modeling (Aim 3). Completion of this proposal will result in a validated IHCA risk score that can be implemented in the electronic health record to trigger life- saving interventions to decrease preventable in-hospital death. In addition, this career development award will provide critical data to inform future R01-level awards, including a clinical trial to investigate he impact of the developed prediction model on patient outcomes. I will complete this project under the direct supervision of my mentor (Dr. David Meltzer), co-mentor (Dr. Dana Edelson), and the rest of my advisory team (Drs. Jesse Hall, Robert Gibbons, and Michael Kattan). Together, this multidisciplinary team brings nationally renowned expertise in in-hospital cardiac arrest, outcomes research, critical care, and clinical prediction modeling. In addition, they serve as Chairs of the Section of Hospital Medicine (Dr. Meltzer), Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care (Dr. Hall), and Quantitative Health Sciences at the Cleveland Clinic (Dr. Kattan), and Directors of the Center for Health and the Social Sciences (Dr. Meltzer), Center for Health Statistics (Dr. Gibbons), and Clinical Research for the Emergency Resuscitation Center (Dr. Edelson). The mentorship, expertise, and resources that they provide will ensure my success as I grow into an independent physician-scientist. My career goal is to become an independent critical care outcomes researcher with a focus on developing prediction models for clinical deterioration that will improve patient outcomes. To accomplish this long-term goal, I have three short-term goals: (1) to gain expertise in the development and implementation of clinical prediction models, (2) to create an IHCA prediction model that will identify high-risk patients on the wards to trigger life-saving interventions, and (3) to gain expertise in simulation modeling in order to study the impact of the developed prediction model. To accomplish these goals, I will build upon the foundation I developed when earning my Master's Degree in Public Health and during my initial training in the PhD program in the Department of Health Studies. Although my training to date has provided me with a strong background in epidemiology and biostatistics, further advanced training in biostatistics is crucial for my development into a successful independent researcher. An integrated program of didactic coursework, seminars, research activities, and conference participation will span the duration of the award. By accomplishing my three short- term goals, I will develop unique skills that will allow me to become a successful independent researcher. Specifically, the expertise I will gain in prediction model development, implementation, and simulation modeling can be applied not only to IHCA research but also to other areas of critical care medicine. In addition, completion of these goals will result in a validated IHCA prediction model that I will study in future implementation and cost-effectiveness studies and will serve as a basis for future R01-level grant submissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over 200,000 in-hospital cardiac arrests occur in the United States each year, and studies suggest that many of these events may be preventable if the clinical warning signs can be identified and acted upon quickly. However, the vast majority of tools used to identify patients at high risk of cardiac arrest were created subjectively and have limited accuracy. Development of a statistically derived risk tool is essential to detect at- risk patients accurately and early in order to provide the best opportunity to improve patient outcomes and reduce preventable in-hospital death.            ",Predicting In-hospital Cardiac Arrest Using Electronic Health Record Data,8617518,K08HL121080,"['Adult', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diastolic blood pressure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hylobates Genus', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social Sciences', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'evidence base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'symposium', 'tool', 'ward']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2014,129546,0.023393199504497864
"Mobile App for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening using Cellphone Retinal Camera     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this SBIR project, we present EyeApp, a smartphone-based end-to-end point-of- care diabetic retinopathy diagnostic device comprising of a smartphone-attachable retinal imaging camera and validated software application enabling fully-automated screening of diabetic retinopathy (DR). DR is the leading cause of new-onset blindness in working-age adults in the industrialized world today. Studies show that in 90% of the cases vision loss can be prevented if DR is diagnosed at an early stage.  Recommended annual screening is expected to significantly improve outcome for diabetic patients, but even in the developed world, majority of the diabetics do not regularly have the annual screening due to several limiting factors. To make things worse, the current cost of screening all diabetics to detect those with early DR is very high because: (a) most patients will have normal exams (thus, causing inefficient use of specialist's time), (b) retinal imaging equipment is very expensive, and (c) trained technicians must operate the imaging equipment. In this project we address these critical limitations by employing cellphone retinal camera attachment, the Ocular CellScope, developed by our collaborators at UCB/UCSF, which simply attaches to an iPhone, doesn't need a trained technician to operate, will obtain wide-field images, and will cost several orders of mag- nitude less than the current tabletop retinal imaging cameras. Diabetic patients can attach the camera to their smartphones and with some assistance (untrained friend, spouse, or nurse) obtain retinal video for each eye using an app residing on the same phone. This app guides the image capture to ensure that best quality frames are obtained, and also ensure all areas of the eye are imaged enabling wide-field imaging. EyeApp's validated algorithms output a near-instant DR screening recommendation score. EyeApp is con- ceptualized as a culmination of over three years of research and development at Eyenuk (on computerized DR screening) and at UCB/UCSF (on smartphone retinal camera) that has already produced functional prototypes of critical technology modules. This phase I project focusses on seamless integration of these proven modules (the camera hardware and the diagnostic software) via several novel ideas.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: EyeApp, a smartphone-based end-to-end point-of-care diabetic retinopathy diagnostic device, will truly enable diabetic retinopathy screening at massive scale, which is necessary and urgent - since the world diabetic population is estimated to be a staggering 371 million, and is projected to grow to over half a billion by 2030. EyeApp will operate in and end-to-end fashion, from retinal imaging to diagnostic screening, all without needing a trained operator. It will cost orders of magnitude less than conventional retinal cameras, and will simply attach to a smartphone, thus greatly reducing the cost and expanding the availability of screening to vast underserved population in the US and the world.            ",Mobile App for Diabetic Retinopathy Screening using Cellphone Retinal Camera,8782362,R43EY024848,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blindness', 'Chairperson', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equipment', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Leadership', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Monitor', 'Nurses', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Specialist', 'Spouses', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'cluster computing', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'cost', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'glucose monitor', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'longitudinal analysis', 'member', 'mobile application', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'professor', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research and development', 'screening', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NEI,"EYENUK, INC.",R43,2014,217002,0.03229434409630818
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.  Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.            ",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8699494,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2014,137160,0.070030635508109
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,8725658,K25DK097279,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Public Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specific qualifier value', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'clinical care', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disorder risk', 'health information technology', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K25,2014,31657,0.09610208573668352
"Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Richard D. Boyce, PhD is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Pittsburgh. He has training in informatics, pharmacoepidemiology, and comparative effectiveness research as well as a strong commitment to improving medication safety for older adults. His prior work has focused on artificial intelligence methods for predicting drug-drug interactions and the comparative safety of  antidepressants for treating de- pressed nursing home residents. The current proposal is for a three year Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) from the National Institute on Aging for training and support that will address gaps in his knowledge of aging research and the nursing home setting. In collaboration with his mentoring team (Drs. Charles Reynolds, Jordan Karp, and Steven Handler) he has developed a training and research plan that will both fill in these knowledge gaps and prepare him for an independent research career. The overarching goal of his K01 is to become an expert on how to effectively translate research results from pharmacoepidemiology and comparative effectiveness research to informatics interventions that improve medication safety for older adults, especially nursing home residents. To accomplish this goal, he proposes eight career development activities and two research aims that will help him 1) obtain rigorous training in the science and practice of creating clinical decision support interventions that are effective in the nursing home setting; 2) obtain a thorough understanding of how falls and fall risk factors are detected, monitored, reported, and assessed in the nursing home setting; and 3) learn the perceptions of multiple nursing home clinician stakeholders on what research is needed to help reduce medication-related adverse events. The two research aims will enable him to integrate and apply the knowledge that he will gain through the proposed training activities by exploring the feasibility and potential clinical usefulness of actively monitoring patients exposed to psycho- tropic PDDIs. The approach would use electronic data available in most United States (US) NHs to provide highly specific and actionable alerts to physicians and/or nurses when a resident who is exposed to a PDDI involving a psychotropic drug transitions to a state of unacceptably high risk for experiencing a fall. Dr. Boyce's hypothesis is that this approach will extend the ability of NH clinicians to perform the recommended ""diligent monitoring"" of PDDIs, while avoiding alert fatigue. He anticipates that the approach would be generalizable to other prevalent NH ADEs (e.g., delirium) and other drug classes (e.g., mood stabilizers). This proposal is relevant to public health because it will explore an innovative approach to managing PDDIs that may ultimately re- duce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). It wil also inform an R-series grant proposal to study a mature intervention that Dr. Boyce plans to submit in year 2 of the project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will impact public health by providing quantitative and qualitative pilot data that will inform the design of an intervention that should ultimately reduce the occurrence of one of the most prevalent multifactorial geriatric syndromes (falls). The work will also provide a solid research basis for future active monitoring interventios targeting a broader set of PDDIs and other adverse events (e.g., delirium) prevalent in the NH setting.",Improving medication safety for nursing home residents prescribed psychotropic dr,8634379,K01AG044433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Aging', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Detection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Geriatric Psychiatry', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Group Interviews', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'High Prevalence', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Jordan', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute on Aging', 'Nurse Practitioners', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Psychotropic Drugs', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Series', 'Solid', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vent', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'effectiveness research', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'high risk', 'hypnotic', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'professor', 'prognostic', 'prototype', 'sedative', 'therapy design']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K01,2014,114449,-0.025600933925090705
"Role of Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells in the Immune Response to Surgery     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Surgical trauma produces a profound inflammatory response that, when deregulated, leads to adverse surgical outcomes including protracted recovery, infection, and organ dysfunction. The immune response to surgery involves complex, multi-cellular mechanisms that are poorly understood. The long-term goals of this proposal are to: 1) use a systems-wide approach to enumerate and characterize the major immune cell subsets, on a cell-by-cell basis, from whole blood samples taken from patients undergoing surgery; 2) understand the mechanistic basis of immune-modulatory interventions designed to improve surgical outcomes (e.g., L-arginine supplementation); 3) understand the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity in order to identify specific mechanisms that are critical for patients' recovery from surgery. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gaudilliere will use a next-generation flow cytometry platform (Cytometry by Time of Flight or CyTOF), recently pioneered and brought to practical utility in the laboratory of Dr. Garry Nolan (Professor of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University and primary mentor for this K23 award). Uniting flow cytometry with mass spectrometry enables readouts from rare earth metal isotopes tagged to antibodies. In contrast to traditional fluorescence-based cytometry, the absence of overlap between detection signals allows for a dramatic increase in the number of parameters that can be measured at the single-cell level (currently up to 45). In a pilot study and working under the guidance of Drs. Garry Nolan and Martin Angst (Professor of Anesthesiology, Stanford University), Dr. Gaudilliere established a quantitative and reproducible mass cytometry assay with which to monitor the immune response in patients undergoing hip replacement (i.e., total hip arthroplasty). The data from this study form the groundwork for Dr. Gaudilliere's core hypothesis that Surgery-induced Myeloid Cells (SiMCs) phenocopy MDSCs and suppress the CD8+ T cell adaptive immune response to surgery via an L-arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 1, Dr. Gaudilliere will build an in vitro system to investigate whether SiMCs suppress terminal effector CD8+ T cell (CD8+Teff) function via an L- arginine-dependent mechanism. In Aim 2, Dr. Gaudilliere proposes a first interventional clinical trial that will use mass cytometry o investigate whether L-arginine supplementation in patients undergoing THA will restore CD8+Teff response in vivo. In Aim 3, Dr. Gaudilliere will adapt and implement statistical tools and learning algorithms (e.g., the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator or LASSO) to investigate whether patient- specific immune features predict surgery-induced expansion of SiMCs and suppression of CD8+Teff cells.  Dr. Gaudilliere is an anesthesiologist at Stanford University School of Medicine with a background in engineering, biochemistry, and molecular biology, and is therefore exceptionally well qualified to address these aims. The Nolan Lab, acknowledged as world-class in the application of mass cytometry to single-cell analysis, will provide Dr. Gaudilliere with the opportunity and environment to acquire the skills for him to become a leading expert in this technology. Furthermore, Dr. Gaudilliere is supported by a multidisciplinary and collaborative team with expertise in signaling biology, human immunology, statistics and bio-informatics, and clinical experimental science and trial design. He will also benefit from the combined strength and resources provided by the Stanford Departments of Anesthesiology, Immunology, and Statistics. To accomplish his research goals and prepare him for a career as an independent investigator, Dr. Gaudilliere has created a multi-disciplinary career development plan incorporating: 1) advanced training in human immunology and immune monitoring with mass cytometry; 2) graduate level didactics in epidemiology and mentored training in clinical study design; and 3) graduate level didactics and mentored training in biostatistics, data mining, and application of machine learning methods for the analysis of complex datasets derived from mass cytometry. In summary, single-cell mass cytometry will be utilized to monitor immune responses to surgery at the systems level in vivo. This approach will not only elucidate specific mechanisms (e.g., arginine-dependent SiMC-mediated suppression of CD8+ T cells) but will also characterize these mechanisms as they occur in the context of the entire immune system. The multidimensional attribute of the data will necessarily generate deeper and potentially more clinically relevant hypotheses than previously posed. The output of this proposal constitutes a data-driven strategy to guide future research efforts and R01 applications to identify patient- specific immune traits predictive of surgical outcomes and explore novel immune-modulatory strategies to improve recovery from surgery.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over forty million surgeries are performed annually in the US alone. Surgical trauma produces a profound inflammatory response that is associated with significant co-morbidity including protracted recovery, poor wound healing, infection, and organ dysfunction. Our research addresses this serious public health problem by 1) elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern the immune response of patients undergoing surgery, 2) characterizing the mechanisms by which immune-modulatory therapies improve surgical outcomes, and 3) identifying patient-specific immunologic markers that determine the immune response to surgery.

Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Comptutational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management. This multidisciplinary project focuses on developing powerful (high-performance) computational, mathematical, and statistical techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous changes from the Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) scans and volumetric Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the optic nerve head. In addition, the Principal Investigator of this proposal will receive extensive training in the areas of computational mathematics and computer vision to augment and strengthen his multidisciplinary expertise essential to execute the proposed specific aims.",New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma,8786916,R00EY020518,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Brain imaging', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastroenterology', 'Generations', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Interferometry', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Eye Institute', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Onset of illness', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visit', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blood flow measurement', 'cancer imaging', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'symposium', 'time use']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MEMPHIS,R00,2014,248999,0.059428189479719784
"Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat Genomes     DESCRIPTION: The goal of this BD2K K01 application is to provide Dr. Jeremy W. Prokop with the mentoring and training to be an independent investigator in big data to knowledge. Mentoring and training will be provided to Dr. Prokop in genomics, proteomics, computer science, and statistics to advance his skill to allow for independence. This will allow for further develop of his sequence-to-structure-to-function analysis for interpretation of protein coding genetic variants into a usable workflow available to other scientists. The mentoring throughout this award will be from Dr. Howard Jacob, a leader in rat/human genetics and tool development to understand variants in whole genomes. Additionally, Dr. Andrew Greene serves as a co-mentor to help advance skills in proteomics and Dr. Christina Kendziorski as a co-mentor to advance statistical tools/approaches. The Medical College of Wisconsin (MCW) is a leader in the use of whole genome sequencing in understanding human health, with a Cap/CLIA certified clinical sequencing facility, tools for identifying genetic variants from whole genomes (such as Carpe Novo), and operation of databases like the Rat Genome Database. These tools and knowledge at MCW will serve as an asset for the training and completion of the Aims in this award. Dr. Prokop's research focus in this grant is to further expand the sequence-to-structure-to-function approaches he developed during his Ph.D. and initial postdoc into a workflow and web submission server for other users. Aim 1 of the grant organizes these steps into a workflow allowing for the development of the web based submission server. To test the workflow, 75 candidate genes for cardiovascular disease will be screened. Initial use of the approach has revealed hypotheses for how genetic variants in Havcr1 and Shroom3 result in altered cardiovascular drug response or disease. Variants in these two proteins will be biochemically characterized using a novel decision tree to standardize experiments (Aim 2) and to serve as a quality control for the approaches of Aim 1. From the results of the 75 screened cardiovascular genes, the four genes with the highest confidence score will be validated using the biochemical decision tree in year four and five of this award serving as an additional quality control for the approaches in Aim 1. This grant will provide the training and support for Dr. Prokop to be integrated into the Medical College of Wisconsin's Clinical Sequencing program, allowing for additional R01 proposals for validation of genetic causes of disease, and facilitate the development of Dr. Prokop into an independent researcher in the use of big data.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of a new tool package that is able to interpret genetic variants of disease genomes into a testable hypothesis of how protein function is perturbed. This tool will allow for improved diagnostic and treatment methods for many human diseases that employ whole genome/exome sequencing such as cardiovascular, cancer, and rare diseases.                ",Using a Sequence-to-Structure-to-Function Approach to Functionally Characterize Protein Coding Missense Mutations in the Human and Rat Genomes,8828878,K01ES025435,"['Actins', 'Affinity', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular Agents', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case Study', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimerization', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Filtration', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Informatics', 'Internet', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Lisinopril', 'Macromolecular Complexes', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Molecular', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Online Systems', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Precipitation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'RNA', 'Rare Diseases', 'Rat Strains', 'Rattus', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science of genetics', 'Scientist', 'Serine', 'Source', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Wisconsin', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic variant', 'genome database', 'genome sequencing', 'human SFN protein', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'mutant', 'novel', 'operation', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'rat genome', 'research study', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIEHS,MEDICAL COLLEGE OF WISCONSIN,K01,2014,96423,0.0386230478901624
"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8730137,K23DK090304,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K23,2014,172287,0.04727998135461611
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials.

"Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this grant proposal is to develop and assess a system to enhance the rational and personalized application of antiplatelet therapy for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, or coronary angioplasty and stenting). This proposal describes a 5 year research and training program designed to provide the candidate, Robert Yeh, the necessary skills and experience to develop an independent academic research career in the conduct of translational cardiovascular outcomes research. Candidate: Dr. Yeh received an MSc in health policy from the London School of Economics, an MD from Harvard Medical School, and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (UCSF) and interventional cardiology (MGH). He is now a junior faculty member at the Massachusetts General Hospital with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. While he has successfully been involved with epidemiologic and secondary data analysis, Dr. Yeh will pursue additional training in the areas of decision analysis, clinical trial conduct and implementation research, and bioinformatics - training which will allow him to translate outcomes research findings into novel interventions which improve patient health. The candidate's long-term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the applied outcomes research that has a broad impact on population health. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Dr. Laura Mauri (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and chief scientific officer of the Harvard Clinical Research Institute (HCRI), and Dr. Sharon- Lise Normand (Co-Mentor), Professor of Health Care Policy at HMS and Vice Chair of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute's Methods Committee. Both are internationally recognized leaders in their respective fields, and provide complementary expertise relevant to the research and training of the candidate. Dr. Mauri has an established track record of successfully leading practice-changing multicenter clinical trials in interventional cardiology, including the NIH/FDA/Industry-sponsored Dual Antiplatelet Theray (DAPT) Study. She has mentored several cardiovascular clinical investigators, including those that have received K awards and R01 funding. Dr. Normand has successfully mentored a large number of successful academic investigators, and is an internationally recognized expert in outcomes and comparative effectiveness research methods used in this proposal. The combined resources of several Harvard Medical School institutions, including HCRI, the Department of Health Care Policy, and the MGH Heart Center will support a rich and productive environment for Dr. Yeh's career development through a combination of didactic training, seminars, weekly research meetings, and conference presentations. Research: In the current era of invasive management of coronary artery disease, balancing the tradeoff between ischemic events and bleeding complications has become integral to decisions regarding the type and duration of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary intervention. In Aim 1, multivariable logistic regression will be used to develop models that can predict bleeding and ischemic events in patients after PCI depending on antiplatelet strategy, using data from the DAPT Study, the largest PCI clinical trial conducted to date, and the Massachusetts PCI Registry, a comprehensive longitudinal registry of patients undergoing coronary intervention. Models that can predict treatment benefit or harm associated with specific strategies will be developed. In Aim 2, decision analysis methods will be employed to enhance these models such that the treatment strategy which is predicted to maximize patient benefit can be identified for all patients, and associated uncertainty in this determination can be assessed. In Aim 3, these tools will be integrated into a novel software application that can execute multivariable risk predictions at the point of care within the MGH cardiac catheterization laboratory. These tools will be used as clinical decision aids, and tested in a prospective randomized clinical trial to determine whether such interventions can enhance clinical decision making. The research will demonstrate how the end products of outcomes research can be translated into innovative interventions that can ""personalize"" medical decisions and ultimately improve patient care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stenting of the heart arteries is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the US. Patients who have these procedures are at risk for having both bleeding and clot-related complications during the procedure as well as for months to years afterwards, which require the careful use of antiplatelet medications. This research will develop and assess the impact of tools that can be used by clinicians and patients to help inform the best use of antiplatelet medications after stenting of the heart arteries, such that bleeding and clotting risks associated with these procedures can be minimized for patients.",Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio,8724553,K23HL118138,"['Accounting', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Analysis', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'London', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'alternative treatment', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'coronary angioplasty', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'percutaneous coronary intervention', 'point of care', 'population health', 'professor', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'routine care', 'routine practice', 'skills', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2014,137160,0.07984698180966171
"Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this K25 proposal is to provide Dr. Benjamin Goldstein Ph.D., M.P.H., with the necessary protected time and additional training to develop as an independent, clinical biostatistician. This proposal has two key components: (1) an innovative research plan and (2) a comprehensive training plan. It is well recognized that patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are at increased risk of cardiac related events which often prove fatal. While substantive research has identified risk factors for these events, little work has been performed on forecasting their occurrence. The proposed research proposes to use existing electronic health record (EHR) data available through a collaborating dialysis center, DaVita Inc, to derive such a prediction model. EHRs contain detailed information on both a patient's health history (e.g. comorbidities, medications) as well as their evolving health statu (i.e. changes in health). A particularly unique aspect of the DaVita EHR system is the availability of real-time measures of health (e.g. blood pressure, pulse) available over the course of an HD session. Through our ongoing collaboration we will have data on 10,000s of individuals each with 100s of HD sessions, presenting the opportunity to analyze millions of dialysis sessions. Within this wealth of data two particular questions will be addressed: (1) How does a patient's hemodynamics vary over the course of and across HD sessions? (2) Can we derive a predictor for the near term onset of a cardiac event? To answer question 1, sophisticated statistical methodology, referred to as functional data analysis (FDA), will be utilized. Patterns of hemodynamic measures will be compared during and across HD sessions with key features extracted. For question 2, machine learning methodology will be used to derive a prediction model for the onset of cardiac events. The final aim will be to assess the feasibility of applying such models within a clinical environment. As a Ph.D. biostatistician, Dr. Goldstein has many of the methodological and computational skills necessary to perform the proposed analyses. The proposed methods, while established, also have ample room for statistical investigation and will provide the basis for methodological research. He will be mentored by Dr. Bradley Efron, professor in the Stanford Department of Statistics, and a world recognized expert in statistical methodology. Serving as a consultant will be Drs. Trevor Hastie and John Ioannidis, fellow members of the department of statistics and experts in FDA and prediction evaluation respectively. The focus of Dr. Goldstein's training will be on developing his clinical expertise. This will be performed through a combination of didactic courses, one-on- one tutorials and clinical exposure. Dr. Wolfgang Winkelmayer, a clinical nephrologist and close collaborator of Dr. Goldstein, will supervise Dr. Goldstein's clinical knowledge development. He will be joined by Dr. Mark Hlatky, a research cardiologist, who will also provide mentorship with regards to the cardiac substance of the project. Additional consultants across the department of medicine will be used as needed. The proposed project will have a tremendous impact on Dr. Goldstein's career prospects. At the end of the 5 year period he will have begun the process of developing a research program in the analysis of EHR data. There will be ample avenues to pursue future studies, through the analysis of other predictor variables (e.g. biomarkers, psycho-social factors), outcomes (e.g. hospitalization, cost) and most importantly, implementation of the prediction models in the clinic. The clinical training period will provide him with the necessary background to succeed as a clinically-oriented biostatistician and develop as a leader in the field. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Electronic health records have become increasingly common in clinical settings but to this point have been underutilized for research purposes. This project will analyze real-time EHR data that are generated during a dialysis session. The focus will be on understanding patients' hemodynamic changes over the course of a three hour dialysis session and using that information to derive a prediction model for severe cardiac events.",Understanding and predicting cardiac events in HD using real-time EHRs,9000970,K25DK097279,[' '],NIDDK,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K25,2014,130765,0.09610208573668352
"Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A career development plan is proposed for Dr. David Mayerich, a computer scientist who is committed to developing an interdisciplinary career in biomedical engineering, with a focus on the collection and analysis of large-scale data sets at sub-micrometer resolution. His graduate research was in the areas of computer visualization and optical imaging, where his work lead to the development of the prototype Knife-Edge Scanning Microscope (KESM). This is the first instrument capable of imaging three-dimensional macro-scale tissue volumes at sub-micrometer resolution while providing a data rate approaching the transfer speed of most modern computer systems.         Since receiving his Ph.D., Dr. Mayerich worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he has worked with biologists and biomedical engineers to develop tools for the segmentation and classification of large data sets. This provided experience in addressing the needs and limitations of the computational tools available to the interdisciplinary community.        The goal of the mentored phase of this proposal is to provide Dr. Mayerich with the opportunity to work as a developer for the FARSIGHT Toolkit. The FARSIGHT Toolkit is an open-source segmentation toolkit that focuses on developing computer vision algorithms specifically tailored to deal with the unique structures found in microscopy data sets. This project is directed by Prof. Badrinath Roysam at the University of Houston, and was awarded first-place in the NIH-sponsored DIADEM Challenge in neuron segmentation. Dr. Mayerich will use his previous experience in biomedical segmentation, GPU-based computing, and efficient data structures to help make the FARSIGHT Toolkit scalable to the terabyte-scale data sets produced using next-generation high-throughput imaging techniques. Dr. Mayerich will receive mentoring in the algorithms and techniques used in the FARSIGHT Toolkit, as well as valuable experience working on a collaborative software development project.         The goal of the independent phase is to use recently developed imaging techniques, along with scalable segmentation algorithms, to construct complete microvascular models of mouse organs. Recent advances in KESM demonstrate that sub-micrometer images of 1cm3 tissue samples can be collected in less than 50 hours. These images have the resolution and quality necessary for (a) complete reconstruction of microvascular networks in whole organs, and (b) the geometric distribution of cell soma in relation to this network. Models describing cellular and microvascular relationships have implications in several diseases, including neurodegenerative disease and tumor growth, as well as clinical applications in tissue engineering and the quantitative analysis of angiogenic drugs and therapies.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this work is to produce high-resolution microvascular models from mouse brain tissue, as well as create algorithms for querying, distributing, and building models from next-generation high-throughput microscopy data sets. These techniques will allow researchers to create large-scale blood flow simulations, simulate the extent of tissue damage due to stroke or aneurism, and explore the relationships between cells and microvessels on a tissue-wide scale. Clinical applications include the quantification of angiogenesis in tumors and tissue implants, and the quantification of neurovascular effects in neurodegenerative disease models.",Large-Scale Reconstruction of Microvascular Networks and the Surrounding Cellular,8508596,K99LM011390,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Systems', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organ', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Simulate', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'instrument', 'memory process', 'mouse model', 'neuronal cell body', 'next generation', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'programs', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'simulation', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor growth']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,K99,2013,87300,0.030769479178070748
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.  Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.            ",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection,8528464,K23AI097225,"['Agriculture', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Area', 'Aspergillosis', 'Aspergillus', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Breath Tests', 'Cereals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Dolin', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Exhalation', 'Fingerprint', 'Fusarium', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppressive Agents', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lung', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Massachusetts', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Modality', 'Molds', 'Mucorales', 'Mucormycosis', 'Mycoses', 'Nutritional', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Respiratory System', 'Respiratory tract structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scedosporium', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium Glutamate', 'Solid', 'Specimen', 'Spectrometry', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The science of Mycology', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Vial device', 'Woman', 'Work', 'air sampling', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cooking', 'data mining', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'microbial', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'point of care', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'volatile organic compound']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2013,137160,0.070030635508109

"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8521270,K23DK090304,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'screening', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K23,2013,172287,0.04727998135461611
"Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K01 award will support my development as an independent investigator with a translational research program that specializes in the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative diseases such as frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Candidate: My research experience as a cognitive neuroscientist ideally positions me to achieve my career goal of becoming an independent investigator with expertise on the cognitive and biological basis of neurodegenerative disease. I have strong cognitive training with an M.Sc in Psycholinguistics and Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Edinburgh, where I was supported by an NRSA Individual Predoctoral Award. During my postdoctoral IGERT fellowship at the Institute for Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I was awarded an NRSA Individual Postdoctoral Fellowship Award to investigate the role of decision-making in language. In this research I have gained experience investigating neurodegenerative disease patients comparatively in order to obtain converging evidence to complement fMRI studies of healthy adults. I have become increasingly interested in translating my research to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. I was recently award the Society for the Neurobiology of Language Postdoctoral Merit Award in recognition of my novel research investigating how social limitations in patients contribute to difficulty in discourse. I have committed to four years of clinical research the NIH Loan Repayment Program, and I intend to commit to clinical research for the duration of my career. I have learned that cognitive and neuroimaging studies provide only one perspective on neurodegenerative diseases. In this proposal, I plan to gain the necessary expertise in biological aspects of FTLD and related conditions to complement my past experiences, and thus achieve my goal of becoming a multifaceted independent investigator with expertise in the cognitive and biological basis for neurodegenerative diseases. With the support of this K01, I will develop expertise to conduct investigations of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), genetic, and neuropathological aspects of neurodegenerative diseases. I will ultimately integrate the biological expertise gained in this proposal with language studies from my cognitive neuroscience research in an effort to identify non-invasive biomarkers that can be used to screen patients for clinical trials and to measure the efficacy of disease-modifying agents. Environment: This award will be conducted at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Neurology, the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR), and the Penn Bioinformatics Center where I have strong institutional support. The proposed institution is an exceptional environment that has expert centers for neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analysis, a leading genetic research core, expert neuropathology, outstanding biostatisical support, and relevant clinical research laboratories. The University of Pennsylvania is unique in comparison to other institutions in the country because all of the above methods are available in one center. My mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentor, Dr. John Trojanowksi, have international reputations for neurodegenerative disease research. My career development will also be supported by my co-mentor, Dr. Lyle Ungar, who has extensive expertise in statistical learning algorithms and in the analysis of proteomic and genomics datasets. Together, this mentorship team will facilitate my development as an independent investigator by providing access to existing and future collaborators, laboratory resources, and exceptional training environments. The CNDR is a world- leading center for neurodegenerative disease research with human and animal models of disease and exceptional translational science. Biofluid biomarker experience is extensive, and several national biofluid cores are centered at Penn (e.g. ADNI). There is a wealth of internationally-recognized neuroimaging expertise at the University of Pennsylvania in the Penn Imaging and Computer Science Laboratory, and I will benefit by integrating neuroimaging resources from these facilities with other modalities of biomarker research. Training: I will develop my expertise in the biological basis of neurodegenerative disease with the support of my mentor, Dr. Murray Grossman, and my co-mentors, Dr. John Trojanowski and Dr. Lyle Ungar. Specifically, with Dr. Trojanowksi I will engage in training related to biofluid and genetic biomarkers of FTLD. I will develop advanced neuroimaging skills and cutting-edge biostatistical methods with Dr. Ungar. Each of these training modalities will be supported by complementary formal coursework, participation in seminars, attendance of conferences, and regularly scheduled meetings with mentorship team. Research: FTLD is a neurodegenerative disease affecting approximately 15 out of 100,000 individuals. In recent years detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have demonstrated distinct sources of histopathological abnormalities in FTLD, including the presence of tau inclusions (FTLD-tau) and TDP-43 proteinopathies (FTLD-TDP). However, there are currently no in vivo methods for discriminating between FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP. There is an urgent need to improve the in vivo diagnosis of FTLD to appropriately enter patients into emerging clinical trials, and to develop sensitive and specific endpoints in trials that can quantify response to these treatments. The overall research aim of this proposal is to develop multimodal methods to improve in vivo diagnosis of FTLD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) affects approximately 15 out of 100,000 adults. Detailed neuropathological investigations at autopsy have identified two distinct sources of histopathological changes that contribute to FTLD. However, there are currently no in vivo methods for diagnosing pathological subtypes of FTLD. There is an urgent need to identify in vivo diagnosis methods to facilitate the identification of appropriate patients to enter into emerging disease-modifying drug treatment trials. The overall aim of this project is to identify multimodal biomarkers of FTLD.",Multimodal Biomarkers in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration,8581245,K01AG043503,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Science', 'Commit', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Country', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environment', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Frontotemporal Lobar Degenerations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Research', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modality', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Pathology', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Progressive Aphasia', 'Process', 'Proteomics', 'Proxy', 'Psycholinguistics', 'Psychology', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive training', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome wide association study', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'screening', 'skills', 'social', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'tool', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2013,128358,0.09814770406990127
"Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objective of this grant proposal is to develop and assess a system to enhance the rational and personalized application of antiplatelet therapy for patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI, or coronary angioplasty and stenting). This proposal describes a 5 year research and training program designed to provide the candidate, Robert Yeh, the necessary skills and experience to develop an independent academic research career in the conduct of translational cardiovascular outcomes research. Candidate: Dr. Yeh received an MSc in health policy from the London School of Economics, an MD from Harvard Medical School, and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (UCSF) and interventional cardiology (MGH). He is now a junior faculty member at the Massachusetts General Hospital with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. While he has successfully been involved with epidemiologic and secondary data analysis, Dr. Yeh will pursue additional training in the areas of decision analysis, clinical trial conduct and implementation research, and bioinformatics - training which will allow him to translate outcomes research findings into novel interventions which improve patient health. The candidate's long-term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the applied outcomes research that has a broad impact on population health. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Dr. Laura Mauri (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and chief scientific officer of the Harvard Clinical Research Institute (HCRI), and Dr. Sharon- Lise Normand (Co-Mentor), Professor of Health Care Policy at HMS and Vice Chair of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute's Methods Committee. Both are internationally recognized leaders in their respective fields, and provide complementary expertise relevant to the research and training of the candidate. Dr. Mauri has an established track record of successfully leading practice-changing multicenter clinical trials in interventional cardiology, including the NIH/FDA/Industry-sponsored Dual Antiplatelet Theray (DAPT) Study. She has mentored several cardiovascular clinical investigators, including those that have received K awards and R01 funding. Dr. Normand has successfully mentored a large number of successful academic investigators, and is an internationally recognized expert in outcomes and comparative effectiveness research methods used in this proposal. The combined resources of several Harvard Medical School institutions, including HCRI, the Department of Health Care Policy, and the MGH Heart Center will support a rich and productive environment for Dr. Yeh's career development through a combination of didactic training, seminars, weekly research meetings, and conference presentations. Research: In the current era of invasive management of coronary artery disease, balancing the tradeoff between ischemic events and bleeding complications has become integral to decisions regarding the type and duration of antiplatelet therapy in patients undergoing coronary intervention. In Aim 1, multivariable logistic regression will be used to develop models that can predict bleeding and ischemic events in patients after PCI depending on antiplatelet strategy, using data from the DAPT Study, the largest PCI clinical trial conducted to date, and the Massachusetts PCI Registry, a comprehensive longitudinal registry of patients undergoing coronary intervention. Models that can predict treatment benefit or harm associated with specific strategies will be developed. In Aim 2, decision analysis methods will be employed to enhance these models such that the treatment strategy which is predicted to maximize patient benefit can be identified for all patients, and associated uncertainty in this determination can be assessed. In Aim 3, these tools will be integrated into a novel software application that can execute multivariable risk predictions at the point of care within the MGH cardiac catheterization laboratory. These tools will be used as clinical decision aids, and tested in a prospective randomized clinical trial to determine whether such interventions can enhance clinical decision making. The research will demonstrate how the end products of outcomes research can be translated into innovative interventions that can ""personalize"" medical decisions and ultimately improve patient care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Stenting of the heart arteries is one of the most commonly performed procedures in the US. Patients who have these procedures are at risk for having both bleeding and clot-related complications during the procedure as well as for months to years afterwards, which require the careful use of antiplatelet medications. This research will develop and assess the impact of tools that can be used by clinicians and patients to help inform the best use of antiplatelet medications after stenting of the heart arteries, such that bleeding and clotting risks associated with these procedures can be minimized for patients.            ",Balancing the Risks of Ischemia and Bleeding in Percutaneous Coronary Interventio,8487063,K23HL118138,"['Accounting', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blood Platelets', 'Cardiac Catheterization Procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Analysis', 'Economics', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Heart', 'Hemorrhage', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Technology', 'Institution', 'Insurance', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'Ischemia', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'London', 'Manuals', 'Massachusetts', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Registries', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Schools', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'alternative treatment', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'coronary angioplasty', 'design', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'patient registry', 'percutaneous coronary intervention', 'point of care', 'population health', 'professor', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'racial and ethnic', 'routine care', 'routine practice', 'skills', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment strategy', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2013,137160,0.07984698180966171
"Pattern Discovery for comparative epigenomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a training program that will prepare an effective independent investigator in computational genomics. The candidate has a PhD in biology from the University of Cambridge and will extend his skills in both computational and wet-lab methods through a two-year program of organized mentorship and training, and a structured five-year research program.  This program will promote the command of machine learning as applied to functional genomics data. Dr. William Noble will mentor the candidate's scientific development. Dr. Noble is a recognized leader in computational biology and machine learning. He holds a dual appointment as Associate Professor in Genome Sciences and Com- puter Science and Engineering, and has trained numerous postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Dr. Jeff Bilmes, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, will contribute to the mentoring effort, and a committee of experienced genome and computational biologists will advise on science and the candidate's career goals.  Research will focus on the analysis of multiple tracks of data from high-throughput sequencing assays, such as the ChIP-seq data produced by the ENCODE Project. These experiments allow us to obtain a more complete picture of the structure of human chromatin, revealing the behavior of transcription factors, the organization of epigenetic modifications, and the locations of accessible DNA across the entire genome at up to single-base resolution. A current challenge is to discover joint patterns across multiple tracks of these functional genomics results simultaneously. This project will (1) develop computational methods for identifying such patterns, providing new ways of finding both well-understood genomic features and novel functional elements, (2) apply those methods to characterize the similarities and differences among different biological samples, establishing a better understanding of chromatin, the bounds of its variation, and its role in human disease, and (3) validate computational findings with laboratory experiments. The project will use a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), a type of probabilistic graphical model, to represent the statistical dependencies between observed data, such as sequencing tag density, on an inferred hidden state sequence.  The Department of Genome Sciences of the University Of Washington School Of Medicine provides an ideal setting for training a new independent investigator with an extensive program of formal and informal education for postdoctoral scientists, opportunities for collaboration with researchers with expertise in diverse areas, and modern computational and laboratory resources. This environment maximizes the potential for the candidate to obtain the training and perform the research necessary to establish himself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program.         The major outcome of this work will be a trained scientist with the skills to run an independent research pro- gram integrating computational methods and genome biology. Additionally, the research will result in improved methodology and software resources for analyzing functional genomics data, and a better understanding of how chromatin state affects molecular biology and human disease.

"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Emerging Invasive Mold Infection     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This resubmission K23 proposal outlines a five-year development plan for Sophia Koo to achieve independence as a patient-oriented clinician-scientist with particular expertise in the development and assessment of novel diagnostic modalities for invasive mold infections (IMI). The strategy outlined in this proposal will enable Dr. Koo to build upon her clinical background in caring for patients at risk for IMI and her clinicl research defining the limitations of currently available diagnostic modalities for these infections by taking advantage of the unique clinical and research strengths of Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, biomedical engineering and bioinformatics capabilities of the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and epidemiology, biostatistics, and analytical chemistry training opportunities at the Harvard School of Public Health, Northeastern University, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She will be co-mentored by Dr. Lindsey Baden, Associate Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, and Dr. Earl Francis Cook, Professor of Epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Baden is an expert in fungal diagnostics, and Dr. Cook is an expert in study design and statistical learning/data mining, including analysis of highly dimensional biomarker data. Dr. Koo will also work closely with Drs. Daniel Kuritzkes, Raphael Dolin, Francisco Marty, John Perfect, and John Wingard, who will provide career guidance and scientific advice on the execution of the proposed research plan, and her collaborators Drs. Paul Vouros, Terence Risby, and James Comolli, who will contribute their expertise in analytical chemistry and breath analysis to her research plan. The research program will employ analytical chemistry and statistical supervised learning approaches to define volatile organic compound (VOC) metabolite patterns of emerging invasive mold species in vitro and in patient breath to lay the groundwork for a noninvasive, point-of-care breath test for patients with emerging IMI. Specifically, this program proposes (1) a detailed definition of the VOC metabolome of the Mucorales, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species that most commonly cause human IMI, and (2) the prospective collection of VOC metabolites in the breath of patients with emerging IMI, patients with clinical and radiographic findings suggestive of an emerging IMI, and patients with respiratory tract colonization by these molds, with derivation and validation of VOC feature support vector machine classification algorithms to discriminate patients with emerging IMI from patients with other fungal infections or non-fungal pulmonary processes. Current diagnostic modalities for these infections are inadequate and often unacceptably morbid, and development of this novel, noninvasive diagnostic approach should allow earlier diagnosis of these infections than currently possible, prospective surveillance in the growing population of patients at risk for emerging IMI, more rational targeting of antifungal therapy, and improved clinical outcomes. Project Narrative Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems. The proposed research seeks to overcome the significant limitations of currently available diagnostic methods for these infections by developing a novel, noninvasive test that identifies unique volatile compounds in the breath of patients with these infections. Development of this sensitive fungal breath test will allow better surveillance and targeting of antifungal therapy in patients at risk for these infections and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.              Invasive mold infections are highly morbid and often fatal in the growing population of patients with compromised immune systems.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,8279285,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Running', 'Rural', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'high risk', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2012,105194,0.04403574407134083
"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma  ABSTRACT  This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Comptutational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans.  PROJECT NARRATIVE  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management. This multidisciplinary project focuses on developing powerful (high-performance) computational, mathematical, and statistical techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous changes from the Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) scans and volumetric Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the optic nerve head. In addition, the Principal Investigator of this proposal will receive extensive training in the areas of computational mathematics and computer vision to augment and strengthen his multidisciplinary expertise essential to execute the proposed specific aims.",New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma,8209138,K99EY020518,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Brain imaging', 'Bruch&apos', 's basal membrane structure', 'Cardiology', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Functional disorder', 'Gastroenterology', 'Generations', 'Genetic screening method', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Interferometry', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Eye Institute', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Onset of illness', 'Ophthalmology', 'Ophthalmoscopes', 'Ophthalmoscopy', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Retinal', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Vision research', 'Visit', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'blood flow measurement', 'cancer imaging', 'computer framework', 'computer science', 'cost', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'improved', 'instrument', 'medical specialties', 'multidisciplinary', 'optic nerve disorder', 'optical imaging', 'prevent', 'programs', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'symposium', 'time use']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2012,89325,0.059428189479719784
"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors. In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel- Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher. An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher. In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD. Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models. This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training. To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills. In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients. Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder. Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially improve the care of these patients.","Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)",8301548,K23DK090304,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advocate', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Charities', 'Chemistry', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Coupled', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease model', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Research', 'Hemoglobin', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Internal Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nephrology', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualifying', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'age related', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'career', 'computer program', 'cost', 'data mining', 'demographics', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'primary care setting', 'skills', 'sound', 'theories', 'treatment as usual', 'trend']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2012,172287,0.04727998135461611
"Machine-Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of new Bacterial Pathogens DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We appreciate the time and effort spent by all the reviewers, and we are grateful for the useful comments and provided suggestions. We have carefully reviewed the critiques and we are happy to see that the panel was receptive to our proposal. The reviewers expressed three major concerns in the summary statement: (1) although the investigating team is well qualified our history of collaboration is short; (2) details regarding the practical constraints of the BARDOT system are lacking; (3) the machine learning techniques employed in the project are considered fairly standard.  Below we briefly discuss the reviewers comments and indicate how we have changed our revised application to address the critique.  (1) Dr. Dundar moved from industry to academia in the fall of 2008, at which point Dr. Rajwa (one of the original inventors of BARDOT) and Dr. Dundar began their collaboration on new approaches to the problem of non-exhaustively defined classes in phenotypic screening. This scientific partnership immediately produced interesting results, and at the time of submission of the original application, Dr. Dundar and Dr. Rajwa had their first manuscript under review. The approach presented in the original proposal was tested and the results were submitted to the ACM 15th Annual SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'09), which is the largest and one of the most respected conferences in this field. The manuscript was accepted after a full peer review as one of the 50 regular papers selected from 551 submissions [20]. Following the proposal submission, research efforts continued and produced yet another approach to the problem described in this grant application. The preliminary findings are reported in a new manuscript which is currently under review [4].  (2) We rewrote the background and research methods sections of our proposal to include information re- quested by the reviewers regarding practical aspects of the BARDOT system, such as accuracy issues (Section D.3.2), frequency of encountering new, unknown classes (Section B.3.1), and validation (Section D.3.1).  (3) The problem of phenotypic screening and classification of bacteria can be defined within exhaustive (stan- dard) or non-exhaustive learning frameworks. Although we agree that the implementation of an exhaustive clas- sification approach for BARDOT does require only fairly standard tools, the problem of the non-exhaustive nature of training libraries cannot be addressed by straightforward use of any textbook-level technique. In fact, the presence of non-exhaustively defined set of classes violates basic assumptions for most supervised learning systems. The issue of non-exhaustively defined classes is the major obstacle for application of machine learning in phenotypic analysis since the number of possible phenotypes may be infinite. In our original proposal we argued that learning with a non-exhaustively defined set of classes remains a very challenging problem, and presented evidence demonstrating that simple extensions of standard techniques cannot provide an acceptable solution. Subsequently, we proposed a new approach based on Bayesian simulation of classes and showed that preliminary results outperformed benchmark techniques [4].  Although these initial results looked promising, we did not consider the described preliminary algorithms final and definitive, and we do not believe that at this point we are able to provide an exact algorithmic solution to this complex problem. If we were able to do that, it would mean that we had already accomplished all the grant goals. The very essence of the proposed research is finding the answer to the defined problem, and the answer will remain unknown until after the work has been done. However, positive reviews and an acceptance of our work by KDD'09 conference judges, tell us that we are heading in the right direction.  In the amended version of this application we propose a modified Bayesian approach based on Wishart priors (Section D.2.3). The algorithm creates new classes on the fly and evaluates maximum likelihood with the updated set of classes, gradually improving detection accuracy for future samples. We believe that this offers a substantial improvement over the previous method. Consequently, the preliminary results in Section C are updated to reflect our progress. Since the modified technique allows for classification with non-exhaustive and exhaustive sets using the same algorithm, we consolidated the previous specific aims 3 and 5 into one in the revised application.

"Pattern Discovery for comparative epigenomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a training program that will prepare an effective independent investigator in computational genomics. The candidate has a PhD in biology from the University of Cambridge and will extend his skills in both computational and wet-lab methods through a two-year program of organized mentorship and training, and a structured five-year research program.  This program will promote the command of machine learning as applied to functional genomics data. Dr. William Noble will mentor the candidate's scientific development. Dr. Noble is a recognized leader in computational biology and machine learning. He holds a dual appointment as Associate Professor in Genome Sciences and Com- puter Science and Engineering, and has trained numerous postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Dr. Jeff Bilmes, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, will contribute to the mentoring effort, and a committee of experienced genome and computational biologists will advise on science and the candidate's career goals.  Research will focus on the analysis of multiple tracks of data from high-throughput sequencing assays, such as the ChIP-seq data produced by the ENCODE Project. These experiments allow us to obtain a more complete picture of the structure of human chromatin, revealing the behavior of transcription factors, the organization of epigenetic modifications, and the locations of accessible DNA across the entire genome at up to single-base resolution. A current challenge is to discover joint patterns across multiple tracks of these functional genomics results simultaneously. This project will (1) develop computational methods for identifying such patterns, providing new ways of finding both well-understood genomic features and novel functional elements, (2) apply those methods to characterize the similarities and differences among different biological samples, establishing a better understanding of chromatin, the bounds of its variation, and its role in human disease, and (3) validate computational findings with laboratory experiments. The project will use a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), a type of probabilistic graphical model, to represent the statistical dependencies between observed data, such as sequencing tag density, on an inferred hidden state sequence.  The Department of Genome Sciences of the University Of Washington School Of Medicine provides an ideal setting for training a new independent investigator with an extensive program of formal and informal education for postdoctoral scientists, opportunities for collaboration with researchers with expertise in diverse areas, and modern computational and laboratory resources. This environment maximizes the potential for the candidate to obtain the training and perform the research necessary to establish himself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major outcome of this work will be a trained scientist with the skills to run an independent research pro- gram integrating computational methods and genome biology. Additionally, the research will result in improved methodology and software resources for analyzing functional genomics data, and a better understanding of how chromatin state affects molecular biology and human disease.              The major outcome of this work will be a trained scientist with the skills to run an independent research pro- gram integrating computational methods and genome biology.

"Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Funding is sought for a five year mentored training period at Brown University for Dr. Nicola Neretti to transition from physics to independent investigator in computational biology. The candidate has a Physics PhD from Brown University, and has been working in the field of signal processing and machine learning. During the past year he has been part of a collaborative project with Dr. John Sedivy (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry) which resulted in a published paper about the analysis of gene expression array data to target c-Myc-activated genes with a correlation-based method. He has established other productive collaborations with members of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology (CCMB) at Brown University. The principal mentor will be Dr. Marc Tatar (Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). The secondary mentors will be Dr. Charles Lawrence (Dep. Applied Mathematics) and Dr. John  Sedivy. The work plan for the five years is to split the training/research effort evenly between computation and biology. For the training requirements the candidate plans to attend courses and workshops in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related fields. Dr. Neretti also plans to complete lab rotations in the laboratory of Dr. Marc Tatar and Dr. John Sedivy, to acquire first hand experience in generating the biological data he will later analyze. The main focus of the research effort will be to use microarray data in time course experiments with a high temporal resolution to elucidate the complex interactions among genes and develop novel analytic techniques in functional genomic. In particular, the candidate proposes to integrate the results of gene clustering/graph analysis (e.g. correlation and tagged correlation based clustering) obtained from the time course data with the information available in genetic/pathway databases relevant to the process of senescence. This will allow the evaluation of given hypotheses about functional relationships among genes and the identification of novel dependencies, which can then be directly tested via experiments in model systems of aging. By using this approach the candidate proposes to address key questions in aging research such as what transcriptional changes are under the control of a nutrient sensing system, the temporal and hierarchical relationship of these changes, the magnitude of change that is biologically relevant, and whether genes within a functional metabolic network are co-regulated at the transcriptional level.                   n/a",Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging,8113231,K25AG028753,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ecology', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Funding Applicant', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Homologous Gene', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nutrient', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detection of nutrient', 'dietary restriction', 'experience', 'fly', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'insulin signaling', 'member', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'senescence']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K25,2011,119416,0.07989895907912901
"New Techniques for Measuring Volumetric Structural Changes in Glaucoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) This K99/R00 application supports additional research training in computational mathematics and computer vision which will enable Dr. Madhusudhanan Balasubramanian-the applicant, to become an independent multidisciplinary investigator in computational ophthalmology. Specifically, in the K99 training phase of this grant, Dr. Balasubramanian will train at UC San Diego under the direction of Linda Zangwill PhD, an established glaucoma clinical researcher in the Department of Ophthalmology, as well as a team of co- mentors, including, Dr. Michael Holst from the Department of Mathematics and co-director for the Center for Computational Mathematics, and co-director of the Computational Science, Mathematics and Engineering and Dr. David Kriegman from Computer Science and Engineering. Training will be conducted via formal coursework, hands-on lab training, mentored research, and progress review by an advisory committee, visiting collaborating researchers and regular attendance at seminars and workshops. The subsequent R00 independent research phase involves applying Dr. Balasubramanian's newly acquired computational techniques to the difficult task of identifying glaucomatous change over time from optical images of the optic nerve head and retinal nerve fiber layer.  A documented presence of progressive optic neuropathy is the best gold standard currently available for glaucoma diagnosis. Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (CSLO) and Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) are two of the optical imaging instruments available for monitoring the optic nerve head health in glaucoma diagnosis and management. Currently, several statistical and computational techniques are available for detecting localized glaucomatous changes from the CSLO exams. SD-OCT is a new generation ophthalmic imaging instrument based on the principle of optical interferometry. In contrast to the CSLO technology, SDOCT can resolve retinal layers from the internal limiting membrane (ILM) through the Bruch's membrane and can capture the 3-D architecture of the optic nerve head at a very high resolution. These high-resolution, high-dimensional volume scans introduce a new level of data complexity not seen in glaucoma progression analysis before and therefore, powerful (high-performance) computational techniques are required to fully utilize the high precision retinal measurements for glaucoma diagnosis. The central focus of this application in the K99 mentored phase of the application will be in 1) developing computational and statistical techniques for detecting structural glaucomatous changes in various retinal layers from the SDOCT scans, and 2) developing a new avenue of research in glaucoma management where in strain in retinal layers will be estimated non-invasively to characterize glaucomatous progression. In the R00 independent phase, the specific aims focus on developing 1) statistical and computational techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous change over time using 3-D SD-OCT volume scans and 2) a computational framework to estimate full-field 3-D volumetric strain from the standard SD-OCT scans.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Detecting the onset and progression of glaucomatous changes in the eye is central to glaucoma diagnosis and management. This multidisciplinary project focuses on developing powerful (high-performance) computational, mathematical, and statistical techniques for detecting volumetric glaucomatous changes from the Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) scans and volumetric Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) scans of the optic nerve head.

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere.

"Developing, Validating, and Implementing a CKD Predictive Model (DELVECKD)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Khaled Abdel-Kader has completed prior training in nephrology and a master's in medical education  with formal training in adult learning, medical errors, and cognitive theory as well as introductory coursework in  clinical research and biostatistics. His primary research interest is characterizing and addressing chronic  kidney disease (CKD) care deficiencies in the primary care setting. He has received individual post-doctoral  funding to support his work in this area. His career goal is to become an expert in CKD epidemiology and an  independent clinical investigator studying electronic medical record (EMR)-based interventions to improve CKD  care and outcomes. In this career development award (CDA), he focuses on improving primary care physician  (PCP) screening for CKD. This award provides him with mentorship, formal coursework, and hands-on  experience in epidemiology, research design, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research,  and biostatistics. He has assembled a group of highly skilled mentors who will guide him and help him develop  into an independent clinical investigator. A supportive research environment that has already cultivated the  development of numerous successful independent clinical investigators complements these individual mentors.  In addition, unique institutional resources including a well-developed EMR, EMR research infrastructure, and  large patient base make the local environment an ideal setting for the candidate and his research. Dr. Abdel-  Kader will use these research experiences, coursework, mentorship, and institutional resources and  commitment to continue his progression to becoming an independently funded clinical researcher.   An important element of the application is the candidate's research proposal. He will conduct his  research project in 2 phases. In the first phase, he will leverage the local, well-developed EMR database and  the University of Pittsburgh's large ambulatory patient base (>450,000 unique patients in the prior 2 years) to  develop a decision tree predictive model to identify patients at high risk for CKD without the use of serum  chemistries. He will compare the performance of the decision tree model to a prominent, recently developed  logistic regression model of CKD risk. After identifying the model with the best performance, the candidate will  conduct a randomized controlled trial of PCPs examining the effect of implementing the CKD predictive model  in the EMR as a clinical alert versus usual care. The clinical alert will remind PCPs to screen high-risk patients  for CKD if they have not already done so. This novel approach pairs machine modeling of CKD risk factors with  an EMR clinical decision support system (CDSS) to provide real-time guidance to PCPs to improve the care  delivered to patients with occult CKD. This project will provide the applicant with valuable experience in data  mining, medical informatics, decision analysis, health services research, and clinical trial design and  implementation. These experiences will be integral to his development into an independent clinical researcher.   In addition to these direct experiences, the applicant will also benefit from the teaching and guidance  provided by his team of proficient mentors and consultants. Dr. Mark Unruh, primary mentor for the proposal, is  a well-funded, independent clinical investigator who brings expertise in epidemiology, clinical trials, and CKD.  Dr. Mark Roberts, Chair of Health Policy and Management at the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of  Public Health, brings a strong record of independent funding and well-established research interests in  predictive modeling, decision tree analysis, and CKD. Dr. Shyam Visweswaran, an investigator in biomedical  informatics, brings expertise in biomedical data mining, predictive modeling, and CDSS. Dr. Charity Moore is a  highly skilled health services statistician with extensive experience in clinical trials. She will bring her expertise  in research design, implementation, analysis, and interpretation to the project. Dr. Gary Fischer, director of the  general internal medicine ambulatory clinic, has substantial experience in the integration of the EMR and  CDSS with physician workflow. Dr. Douglas Landsittel, a statistician with an interest in the classification of  disease outcomes using decision trees, has extensive experience in building and validating predictive models.  This interdisciplinary team combines uniquely qualified investigators with the diversity of experience and  expertise necessary for the successful completion of the proposed research and the candidate's training.   To complement these hands-on experiences and mentorship activities, the candidate will undertake formal  coursework through the University of Pittsburgh's Graduate School of Public Health, Department of Biomedical  Informatics, and the Institute for Clinical Research Education (part of the university's Clinical and Translational  Science Institute). These courses will include formal training in research design and clinical trial  implementation, applied medical informatics and decision analysis, and methods in health services research  and biostatistics. In addition, the medical center has numerous seminars, workshops, and leadership courses  that the candidate will participate in to form collaborative relationships and enhance his skills.   In summary, the candidate's research interest in improving the quality of CKD care delivery coupled with a  sound background in medical education and early training in clinical research make him an ideal candidate to  use this CDA to investigate EMR interventions that can broadly improve CKD screening by PCPs. The  applicant's experienced, multidisciplinary mentorship team, strong institutional resources and support, and the  formal training he will complete under this award will ensure that he continues to develop into a successful  independent clinical investigator studying methods to improve PCP care delivery to CKD patients.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder.  Evidence indicates that late recognition and suboptimal care of chronic kidney disease contributes to poor  health in these patients. This study will develop a model that can predict the presence of chronic kidney  disease without the use of blood work. This model will be implemented to alert doctors in real-time to screen  high-risk patients who may have unrecognized chronic kidney disease with the potential to substantially  improve the care of these patients.        Chronic kidney disease is a growing public health problem with over 10% of adults affected by the disorder.

"Machine-Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of new Bacterial Pathogens    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We appreciate the time and effort spent by all the reviewers, and we are grateful for the useful comments and provided suggestions. We have carefully reviewed the critiques and we are happy to see that the panel was receptive to our proposal. The reviewers expressed three major concerns in the summary statement: (1) although the investigating team is well qualified our history of collaboration is short; (2) details regarding the practical constraints of the BARDOT system are lacking; (3) the machine learning techniques employed in the project are considered fairly standard.  Below we briefly discuss the reviewers comments and indicate how we have changed our revised application to address the critique.  (1) Dr. Dundar moved from industry to academia in the fall of 2008, at which point Dr. Rajwa (one of the original inventors of BARDOT) and Dr. Dundar began their collaboration on new approaches to the problem of non-exhaustively defined classes in phenotypic screening. This scientific partnership immediately produced interesting results, and at the time of submission of the original application, Dr. Dundar and Dr. Rajwa had their first manuscript under review. The approach presented in the original proposal was tested and the results were submitted to the ACM 15th Annual SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'09), which is the largest and one of the most respected conferences in this field. The manuscript was accepted after a full peer review as one of the 50 regular papers selected from 551 submissions [20]. Following the proposal submission, research efforts continued and produced yet another approach to the problem described in this grant application. The preliminary findings are reported in a new manuscript which is currently under review [4].  (2) We rewrote the background and research methods sections of our proposal to include information re- quested by the reviewers regarding practical aspects of the BARDOT system, such as accuracy issues (Section D.3.2), frequency of encountering new, unknown classes (Section B.3.1), and validation (Section D.3.1).  (3) The problem of phenotypic screening and classification of bacteria can be defined within exhaustive (stan- dard) or non-exhaustive learning frameworks. Although we agree that the implementation of an exhaustive clas- sification approach for BARDOT does require only fairly standard tools, the problem of the non-exhaustive nature of training libraries cannot be addressed by straightforward use of any textbook-level technique. In fact, the presence of non-exhaustively defined set of classes violates basic assumptions for most supervised learning systems. The issue of non-exhaustively defined classes is the major obstacle for application of machine learning in phenotypic analysis since the number of possible phenotypes may be infinite. In our original proposal we argued that learning with a non-exhaustively defined set of classes remains a very challenging problem, and presented evidence demonstrating that simple extensions of standard techniques cannot provide an acceptable solution. Subsequently, we proposed a new approach based on Bayesian simulation of classes and showed that preliminary results outperformed benchmark techniques [4].  Although these initial results looked promising, we did not consider the described preliminary algorithms final and definitive, and we do not believe that at this point we are able to provide an exact algorithmic solution to this complex problem. If we were able to do that, it would mean that we had already accomplished all the grant goals. The very essence of the proposed research is finding the answer to the defined problem, and the answer will remain unknown until after the work has been done. However, positive reviews and an acceptance of our work by KDD'09 conference judges, tell us that we are heading in the right direction.  In the amended version of this application we propose a modified Bayesian approach based on Wishart priors (Section D.2.3). The algorithm creates new classes on the fly and evaluates maximum likelihood with the updated set of classes, gradually improving detection accuracy for future samples. We believe that this offers a substantial improvement over the previous method. Consequently, the preliminary results in Section C are updated to reflect our progress. Since the modified technique allows for classification with non-exhaustive and exhaustive sets using the same algorithm, we consolidated the previous specific aims 3 and 5 into one in the revised application.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A Machine Learning Approach to Label-free Detection of Bacterial Pathogens  using Laser Light Scattering  PIs: Dr. M.

"Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Funding is sought for a five year mentored training period at Brown University for Dr. Nicola Neretti to transition from physics to independent investigator in computational biology. The candidate has a Physics PhD from Brown University, and has been working in the field of signal processing and machine learning. During the past year he has been part of a collaborative project with Dr. John Sedivy (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry) which resulted in a published paper about the analysis of gene expression array data to target c-Myc-activated genes with a correlation-based method. He has established other productive collaborations with members of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology (CCMB) at Brown University. The principal mentor will be Dr. Marc Tatar (Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). The secondary mentors will be Dr. Charles Lawrence (Dep. Applied Mathematics) and Dr. John  Sedivy. The work plan for the five years is to split the training/research effort evenly between computation and biology. For the training requirements the candidate plans to attend courses and workshops in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related fields. Dr. Neretti also plans to complete lab rotations in the laboratory of Dr. Marc Tatar and Dr. John Sedivy, to acquire first hand experience in generating the biological data he will later analyze. The main focus of the research effort will be to use microarray data in time course experiments with a high temporal resolution to elucidate the complex interactions among genes and develop novel analytic techniques in functional genomic. In particular, the candidate proposes to integrate the results of gene clustering/graph analysis (e.g. correlation and tagged correlation based clustering) obtained from the time course data with the information available in genetic/pathway databases relevant to the process of senescence. This will allow the evaluation of given hypotheses about functional relationships among genes and the identification of novel dependencies, which can then be directly tested via experiments in model systems of aging. By using this approach the candidate proposes to address key questions in aging research such as what transcriptional changes are under the control of a nutrient sensing system, the temporal and hierarchical relationship of these changes, the magnitude of change that is biologically relevant, and whether genes within a functional metabolic network are co-regulated at the transcriptional level.                   n/a",Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging,7895558,K25AG028753,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ecology', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Funding Applicant', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Homologous Gene', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nutrient', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detection of nutrient', 'dietary restriction', 'experience', 'fly', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'insulin signaling', 'member', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'senescence']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K25,2010,116662,0.07989895907912901

"Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Funding is sought for a five year mentored training period at Brown University for Dr. Nicola Neretti to transition from physics to independent investigator in computational biology. The candidate has a Physics PhD from Brown University, and has been working in the field of signal processing and machine learning. During the past year he has been part of a collaborative project with Dr. John Sedivy (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry) which resulted in a published paper about the analysis of gene expression array data to target c-Myc-activated genes with a correlation-based method. He has established other productive collaborations with members of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology (CCMB) at Brown University. The principal mentor will be Dr. Marc Tatar (Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). The secondary mentors will be Dr. Charles Lawrence (Dep. Applied Mathematics) and Dr. John  Sedivy. The work plan for the five years is to split the training/research effort evenly between computation and biology. For the training requirements the candidate plans to attend courses and workshops in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related fields. Dr. Neretti also plans to complete lab rotations in the laboratory of Dr. Marc Tatar and Dr. John Sedivy, to acquire first hand experience in generating the biological data he will later analyze. The main focus of the research effort will be to use microarray data in time course experiments with a high temporal resolution to elucidate the complex interactions among genes and develop novel analytic techniques in functional genomic. In particular, the candidate proposes to integrate the results of gene clustering/graph analysis (e.g. correlation and tagged correlation based clustering) obtained from the time course data with the information available in genetic/pathway databases relevant to the process of senescence. This will allow the evaluation of given hypotheses about functional relationships among genes and the identification of novel dependencies, which can then be directly tested via experiments in model systems of aging. By using this approach the candidate proposes to address key questions in aging research such as what transcriptional changes are under the control of a nutrient sensing system, the temporal and hierarchical relationship of these changes, the magnitude of change that is biologically relevant, and whether genes within a functional metabolic network are co-regulated at the transcriptional level.                   n/a",Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging,7652367,K25AG028753,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational Molecular Biology', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependency', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ecology', 'Educational workshop', 'Evaluation', 'Five-Year Plans', 'Funding Applicant', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Homologous Gene', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Biology', 'Mutation', 'Nematoda', 'Nutrient', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'c-myc Genes', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detection of nutrient', 'dietary restriction', 'experience', 'fly', 'functional genomics', 'improved', 'insulin signaling', 'member', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'receptor', 'research study', 'response', 'senescence']",NIA,BROWN UNIVERSITY,K25,2009,124786,0.07989895907912901

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere.

"Identifying network pertubation using secreted protein profiles in glioblastoma    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is focused both on career development and on the completion of a specific independent research plan related particularly to the mission of the National Cancer Institute. The career development objective of this award is to enable the transition of Dr. Nathan Price from his current position as a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Systems Biology to an assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign capable of competing for independent funding in cancer research. Dr. Price has an exceptionally strong track record in systems biology for his career stage, having co-authored over 20 articles for publication in his graduate studies as well as completing significant cancer-related studies during his postdoctoral training. Dr. Price accepted a faculty position at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign prior to finishing graduate school, but chose to defer this position for 2-3 years for the express purpose of transitioning his career focus onto systems analysis of cancer. The mentored phase of this award will provide Dr. Price with the opportunity to receive guidance from one of the leading scientists in the world working on systems approaches to cancer, Dr. Leroy Hood, who is President of the Institute for Systems Biology, Director of the Center for Systems Biology, and Co-Director of the Nanosystems Biology Cancer Center. Dr. Price's proposed research focuses on developing a novel capability to identify causal network perturbations involved in glioblastoma through analysis of patterns in secreted protein concentrations. This work will also focus on studying the relationship between transcriptomic data (which is plentiful) with secreted protein data (which serve as ideal diagnostic markers). The associated measurements of secreted proteins will provide a wealth of candidate markers for glioblastomas, and a team of glioblastoma researchers has been assembled to assist in translating the work of this project to the clinic (to be financed elsewhere). The ultimate long-term goal of this work is to develop highly informative secreted protein marker panels for glioblastoma multiforme, the most aggressive and deadly form of glioma. The use of systems analysis of blood, coupled with computational models of interacting networks such as will be developed in this-study, has the long-term potential not only of identifying perturbed networks in vivo, but eventually of enabling a new avenue of studying human biology and disease in vivo in a non-invasive manner.      The relevance of this work to public health is that specific secreted protein markers for glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer common particularly in children, will be developed where none exist today. These rnarkers will allow for the earlier diagnosis and hence better prognosis of patients, and will be far less irjvasive than the brain biopsy currently required to diagnose advanced gliomas. Also, we will identify perturbed subnetworks in the most aggressive type of glioma (glioblastoma multiforme) leading to potential drug targets for further analysis.                    n/a",Identifying network pertubation using secreted protein profiles in glioblastoma,7917085,R00CA126184,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens', 'Arts', 'Astrocytes', 'Atlases', 'Australia', 'Award', 'Back', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Breast', 'Buffers', 'Calibration', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer cell line', 'Caseins', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Complex Mixtures', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Core Facility', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Culture Media', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Dissociation', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug usage', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electromagnetic Energy', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Essential Amino Acids', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Film', 'Freezing', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Glean', 'Glioblastoma', 'Glioma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Halobacterium', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Humidity', 'IGFBP2 gene', 'Illinois', 'Image', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunization', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Incubated', 'Individual', 'Information Networks', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Institutes', 'Ions', 'Isotope Labeling', 'Kinetics', 'Knock-out', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Light', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Lysine', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Mus', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Neurosciences', 'Nutritional', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Organ Specificity', 'Outcome', 'PTEN gene', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Participant', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Personal Communication', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Printing', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Fingerprints', 'Protein-Protein Interaction Map', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Refractive Indices', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Running', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Screening procedure', 'Serum', 'Serum-Free Culture Media', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stable Isotope Labeling', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TP53 gene', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfection', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'analog', 'base', 'biological systems', 'candidate marker', 'cell growth', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'clinical application', 'computer based statistical methods', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'cytokine', 'dalton', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exhaust', 'follow-up', 'glioma cell line', 'halobacteria', 'immortalized cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrument', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'knock-down', 'knowledge base', 'light intensity', 'macrophage', 'mass spectrometer', 'multiple reaction monitoring', 'nanosystems', 'network models', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'oligodendroglioma', 'polyclonal antibody', 'preference', 'processing speed', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'protein protein interaction', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'response', 'sarcoma', 'technology development', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'tumorigenesis']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R00,2009,249000,0.028800792551456317

"Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chagas disease, caused by the unicellular parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a preventable disease. Nevertheless more people in the Americas die from Chagas disease than any other parasitic infection. This application will provide tutorial-based training to the applicant in mathematical modeling and modern computer science at the University of Pennsylvania and the Bloomberg School of Public Health of Johns Hopkins University. Training will be geared towards developing the skills necessary to address complex problems hindering the control of Chagas disease. The long term goal of the research is to integrate diagnostic testing of children at high risk of T. cruzi infection into control programs focused mainly on vector elimination, and to better guide vector elimination campaigns. In addition to tutorial-based training in the United States, entomologic and clinical research will be conducted in Peru in coordination with a research grant awarded by   the Fogarty International Center to Dr. Cesar Naquira and collaborators. In Arequipa, a city of nearly one million inhabitants in southern Peru, T. cruzi and Chagas disease have become urban problems. A quiet epidemic of Chagas disease infection is progressing across the city. The specific aims of this application are: 1) To develop techniques to understand and control T. cruzi transmission in epidemic situations, and, 2. To optimize the spatio-temporal ordering of the Chagas disease vector control   campaign in Arequipa, and to elucidate best-practice strategies for vector control elsewhere. In developing these mathematical techniques the candidate will receive quantitative training that will complement his previous work on infectious disease and allow him to develop into a well-rounded independent investigator. RELEVANCE: Integrating diagnosis of children for T cruzi infection into Chagas control campaigns has the potential to greatly reduce morbidity and mortality due to Chagas disease in Peru and elsewhere. Optimizing the spatio-temporal order of vector control campaigns can increase the probability that these eliminate future transmission of T cruzi.          n/a",Mathematical Techniques for Control of Epidemic Trypanosoma cruzi Transmission,7510774,K01AI079162,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Award', 'Brazil', 'Capital', 'Chagas Disease', 'Child', 'Chile', 'Cities', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Vectors', 'Ecology', 'Empirical Research', 'Epidemic', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Housing', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Insect Vectors', 'Insecticides', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Parasites', 'Parasitic Diseases', 'Parasitic infection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Peru', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Residual state', 'Retinal Cone', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Rural Community', 'Solutions', 'South America', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Triatoma', 'Tropical Medicine', 'Trypanosoma cruzi', 'Tuberculosis', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'computer science', 'disease transmission', 'disorder control', 'international center', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'programs', 'pyrethroid', 'rural area', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'transmission process', 'urban area', 'vector', 'vector control']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2008,94531,0.04403574407134083

"Computational Biology of Transcriptional Networks in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Funding is sought for a five year mentored training period at Brown University for Dr. Nicola Neretti to transition from physics to independent investigator in computational biology. The candidate has a Physics PhD from Brown University, and has been working in the field of signal processing and machine learning. During the past year he has been part of a collaborative project with Dr. John Sedivy (Department of Molecular and Cell Biology and Biochemistry) which resulted in a published paper about the analysis of gene expression array data to target c-Myc-activated genes with a correlation-based method. He has established other productive collaborations with members of the Center for Computational Molecular Biology (CCMB) at Brown University. The principal mentor will be Dr. Marc Tatar (Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology). The secondary mentors will be Dr. Charles Lawrence (Dep. Applied Mathematics) and Dr. John  Sedivy. The work plan for the five years is to split the training/research effort evenly between computation and biology. For the training requirements the candidate plans to attend courses and workshops in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, bioinformatics, and related fields. Dr. Neretti also plans to complete lab rotations in the laboratory of Dr. Marc Tatar and Dr. John Sedivy, to acquire first hand experience in generating the biological data he will later analyze. The main focus of the research effort will be to use microarray data in time course experiments with a high temporal resolution to elucidate the complex interactions among genes and develop novel analytic techniques in functional genomic. In particular, the candidate proposes to integrate the results of gene clustering/graph analysis (e.g. correlation and tagged correlation based clustering) obtained from the time course data with the information available in genetic/pathway databases relevant to the process of senescence.

"Quantitative Analysis Methods for Complex Trait Genetics DESCRIPTION: (Provided by Applicant): Cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for premature death and creates a substantial public health burden. While studies have shown that smoking and nicotine dependence are complex traits influenced by significant genetic components, further research is needed to identify genes that influence susceptibility and resistance. The research goal of this proposal is to develop and evaluate new methods for the genetic analysis of complex traits in the context of career development for the candidate, Dr. Nancy Saccone. Dr. Saccone will use artificial neural networks and logistic regression models as her primary methodological tools, and will develop and apply methods especially suited for studying the complex genetics of nicotine addiction and related phenotypes. Preliminary studies have been promising and indicate that further investigation of genetic methods based on these tools is warranted. The research plan will also extend the scope of these applications to include uses for genetic association analysis, as large-scale disequilibrium and association-based approaches are expected to become increasingly important for complex trait gene mapping. Dr. Saccone has chosen Dr. John Rice as mentor and will work with additional co-mentors and consultants. The training components of this proposal will expand Dr. Saccone?s experience to include: ongoing training in the ethical conduct of research, further training in the clinical and biological aspects of nicotine and other substance addiction, and the development of expertise in the use and analysis of other kinds of genetic data besides genotypic data, such as gene expression array data, which will play increasingly important roles in the study of human complex traits.

"Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is a leading reversible cause of death after blunt trauma. Prediction of arterial bleeding risk is difficult, and currently determined using subjective criteria, often based on qualitative results of admission computed tomography (CT). Segmented hematoma and contrast extravasation (CE) volumes predict need for angioembolization, major transfusion, and mortality but cannot be applied in real-time. The ill-defined multi-focal nature of pelvic hematomas and CE prevents reliable estimation using diameter-based measurements. Dr. Dreizin is a trauma radiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine. His early work has focused on improving the speed and reliability of volumetric analysis of pelvic hematomas using semi-automated techniques, and derivation of a logistic regression-based prediction tool for major arterial injury after pelvic fractures. Dr. Dreizin’s goal for this four- year K08 mentored career development award proposal is to gain the skills needed to 1) implement deep learning architectures for automated hematoma volume segmentation and 2) develop computational models for outcome prediction after pelvic trauma. These tools could greatly improve the speed and accuracy of clinical decision making in the setting of life-threatening traumatic pelvic bleeding. Fully convolutional neural networks (FCNs) have emerged as the most robust and scalable method for automated medical image segmentation. Intuitive software platforms for training FCN implementations and generating multivariable machine learning models have been developed in the Python programming environment. The training objectives and research activities of this proposal are necessary to provide Dr. Dreizin with new skills and practical experience in Python programming, deep learning software, and computational modeling software. By understanding the principles and computational infrastructure behind modern machine learning, Dr. Dreizin will be able to train and validate state-of-the-art algorithms independently and effectively lead a team of researchers in this area. To achieve his goals, Dr. Dreizin has assembled a multidisciplinary team of mentors, advisors, and collaborators with world-leading expertise in computer vision in medical imaging, probability theory, data science, and comparative effectiveness research. Dr. Dreizin will focus on two specific aims. In Aim 1, he will train and validate deep learning architectures for segmentation of traumatic pelvic hematomas and CE by computing the Dice metric, time effort, and correlation with clinical outcomes. In Aim 2, he will generate and test quantitative models for predicting major arterial bleeding after pelvic trauma based on a rich multi-label dataset of segmented features. The training and pilot data will be necessary for Dr. Dreizin’s long- term goal of research independence and R01 support to develop automated segmentation algorithms for the spectrum of clinically important imaging features after pelvic trauma, as well as fully automated multivariable clinical prediction tools with potential for translation to industry and as an FDA-cleared product. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Hemorrhage after pelvic fractures is common after motor vehicle collisions, falls, and crush injuries, with mortality rates that range from 5-54%. The volume of hemorrhage, as measured on computed tomography (CT) scans, predicts the need for rapid intervention or transfusion, and is a strong predictor of mortality, but no automated image-processing methods exist for real-time hemorrhage volume measurement. We propose to develop automated software for hemorrhage-detection, and real-time risk prediction software for major arterial hemorrhage after pelvic fractures.",Machine learning-based segmentation and risk modeling for real-time prediction of major arterial bleeding after pelvic fractures,9955253,K08EB027141,"['Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Arterial Injury', 'Award', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Caliber', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Crush Injury', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Extravasation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hematoma', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maryland', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability Theory', 'Process', 'Programming Languages', 'Pythons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shorthand', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Vehicle crash', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'artificial neural network', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'computer infrastructure', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'experience', 'fall injury', 'hemodynamics', 'heuristics', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'muscle form', 'neural network architecture', 'outcome prediction', 'pelvis fracture', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'radiologist', 'random forest', 'real time model', 'secondary outcome', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'support vector machine', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,K08,2020,186183,0.061948156843385456
"Using artificial intelligence to enable early identification and treatment of peripheral artery disease ABSTRACT The purpose of this award is to provide Dr. Elsie Ross, Assistant Professor of Surgery (Vascular Surgery) and Medicine (Biomedical Informatics Research) at Stanford University, the support necessary to transition her from a junior investigator into an independent surgeon-scientist in translational biomedical informatics. Dr. Ross is a vascular surgeon with an advanced degree in health services research and postdoctoral training in biomedical informatics. Her long-term goal is to combine her interdisciplinary training to develop and implement machine learning tools that will enable the delivery of precise, high-value care to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Her career development activities focus on advancing her ability to translate informatics discoveries into viable clinical tools by 1) completing didactic courses to deepen and expand her knowledge of deep learning algorithms, clinical trials and implementation science, 2) designing and conducting her first independent human subjects clinical research study evaluating the performance of machine learning technology, 3) implementing and evaluating the effects of an electronic health record (EHR)-based screening tool to identify latent vascular disease, and 4) strengthening her previous training in cost-effectiveness analysis to enable her future aim of evaluating the associated costs and utility of pro-active, automated disease screening. The candidate has convened a mentorship team that includes Dr. Nigam Shah, a biomedical informatics expert who combines machine learning, text-mining and medical ontologies to enable a learning health care system; Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey a world-expert in cardiovascular clinical trials; and Dr. Paul Heidenreich, an expert in implementation sciences with a focus on the use of EHR interventions to improve care quality for cardiovascular patients and evaluating the cost-effectiveness of new technologies. The research proposal builds on the candidate's prior work with using machine learning and EHR data to evaluate and predict cardiovascular disease outcomes. The candidate now proposes to characterize the performance of machine learning algorithms in identifying patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) using EHR data (Aim 1), evaluate whether learned classification models perform better than traditional risk factors for identification of undiagnosed PAD in a prospective patient cohort (Aim 2), and implement an EHR-based screening tool to identify patients with undiagnosed PAD and evaluate the diagnosis and treatment effects (Aim 3). Completion of the proposed research will result in a novel, EHR-based screening tool for identification of undiagnosed vascular disease that can decrease PAD-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality through earlier and more aggressive medical management. This research will also form the basis for an R01 application before the end of the award to conduct a multi-site randomized-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the impact of EHR- based proactive PAD screening. ! ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease is a prevalent yet under-diagnosed condition that can lead to limb loss, stroke, heart attacks and/or premature death. Work proposed in this grant aims to develop technology using electronic health records and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify patients with undiagnosed peripheral artery disease and recommend treatment.

"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health.

Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups),9851429,K01HL144607,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Assessment tool', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cholesterol', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Equation', 'Ethnic group', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Research', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Mexican Americans', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Puerto Rican', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'South Asian', 'Stable Populations', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Veterans', 'Woman', 'Work', 'atherosclerosis risk', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'college', 'disability', 'disparity reduction', 'epidemiologic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health difference', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'minority health', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevention service', 'public health intervention', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'random forest', 'risk prediction model', 'side effect', 'skills', 'structured data', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support vector machine', 'treatment guidelines', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,172001,0.06859129451938052
"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques. We propose leveraging state of the art deep learning models built using data from hospitals and insurers to both predict which pregnancies will result in preterm birth and to predict which preterm infants will experience severe cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.",Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning,9850130,K01HL141771,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Accounting', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Boston', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cardiac', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Graduate Degree', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Human Pathology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Outcome', 'Patent Ductus Arteriosus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Premature Labor', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'education planning', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'peer', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'social', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'structured data']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2020,166320,0.03400092777049754
"Development of Accurate and Interpretable Machine Learning Algorithms for their application in Medicine Project Summary  The objective of this proposal is to provide a robust course of training for Gilmer Valdes, PhD, DABR, a candidate with an excellent foundation in clinical and machine learning research, to enable him to become an independent investigator. The proposed research aims to address a tradeoff between interpretability and accuracy of modern machine learning algorithms which limits their use in clinical practice. The candidate’s central hypothesis is that the current tradeoff is not a law of nature but rather a limitation of current interpretable machine learning algorithms. Towards proving this hypothesis, the candidate, leading a multidisciplinary team, have developed unique mathematical frameworks (MediBoost and the Conditional Interpretable Super Learner) to build interpretable and accurate models. The proposed research will I) implement and extensively benchmark these frameworks and II) use the algorithms develop to solve three clinical problems where potentially suboptimal models are currently used to make clinical decisions: 1) predicting mortality in the Intensive Care Unit, 2) predicting risk of Hospital Acquired Venous Thromboembolism, 3) predicting which prostate cancer patients benefit the most from adjuvant radiotherapy. The candidate’s training and research plan, multidisciplinary by nature, takes advantage of the proximity of UC San Francisco, Stanford and UC Berkeley and proposes a training plan that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere. Recognizing the multidisciplinary nature of the work proposed, the author will be mentored and work closely with a stellar committee from three institutions and different scientific areas (Machine Learning, Biostatistics, Statistics, Hospital Medicine, Cancer Research and Quality Assurance in Medicine): Jerome H. Friedman PhD (Stanford Statistics Department), Mark Van der Laan PhD (Berkeley Biostatistics and Statistics Department), Mark Segal (UCSF Epidimiology and Biostatistics Deparments), Andrew Auerbach MD (UCSF Medicine Department), Felix Y. Feng MD (UCSF Radiation Oncology),and Timothy D. Solberg PhD (UCSF Radiation Oncology). This committee will be coordinated by Dr Solberg. The candidate also counts with a strong a multidisciplinary team of collaborators. Successful completion of the proposed research will develop the next generation of accurate and interpretable Machine Learning algorithms and solve three important clinical problems where linear models are currently used in clinical settings. This proposal has wide-ranging implications across the healthcare spectrum. The intermediate-term goal is for the candidate to acquire the knowledge, technical skills and expertise necessary to submit a successful R01 proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current state of the art machine learning algorithms have a marked tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability. In medicine, where errors can have a dire consequence and knowledge representation and validation is as relevant as accuracy, the development of accurate and interpretable algorithms is of paramount importance. My research project will address a critical public health need by developing machine learning algorithms that are both accurate and interpretable, and apply them to solve specific clinical problems.",Development of Accurate and Interpretable Machine Learning Algorithms for their application in Medicine,9989861,K08EB026500,"['Address', 'Adjuvant Radiotherapy', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laws', 'Libraries', 'Limb structure', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mathematics', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Pneumonia', 'Polynomial Models', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Survival Analysis', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'artificial neural network', 'asthmatic patient', 'classification trees', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'improved', 'information organization', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'quality assurance', 'random forest', 'regression trees', 'standard care', 'statistics', 'structured data', 'task analysis', 'theories', 'venous thromboembolism']",NIBIB,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K08,2020,182232,0.026796885261266053
"Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning Project Summary Dr. Pappas is a junior faculty member in the Medicine Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, with appointments in the Center for Value-Based Care Research and the Department of Hospital Medicine (Cleveland, OH). This career development award aims to provide training in propensity methods, deep learning techniques, and pilot intervention development, ultimately seeking to identify personalized approaches to cardiac stress testing before surgery. Noncardiac surgery carries risk of mortality and morbidity, and cardiac complications account for the largest share of perioperative mortality. Meanwhile, current approaches are expensive and may not effectively reduce cardiac risk. This proposal uses machine learning techniques to define the value of information provided by each different kind of stress test and the expected benefit of different therapeutic interventions through which preoperative risks might be modified. It then seeks to identify the most helpful cardiac stress test, if any. In this career development award, Dr. Pappas proposes three phases of investigation, and in so doing will acquire new skills critical to achieving his goal of becoming an expert in perioperative risk mitigation. In Aim 1, Dr. Pappas will use propensity matching techniques to evaluate prior associations between preoperative stress testing and improved postoperative mortality, when including rich clinical data not available to previous large studies. In Aim 2, he will use machine learning techniques to estimate the value of information provided by each modality of stress testing, and the impact on the risk of each event from each intervention. In Aim 3, Dr. Pappas will pilot an intervention presenting personalized estimates to physicians in the preoperative clinic. In addition to advanced training through formal coursework, this career development award is supported by an extraordinary mentorship team, including internationally-recognized experts in perioperative outcomes research, cardiovascular disease, use of observational healthcare data, and machine learning. The combination of formal training and mentored research outlined in this application is designed to ensure that Dr. Pappas will emerge from this award as an independent investigator and expert in personalized perioperative decision-making. Project Narrative Many patients die soon after surgery, and many of those deaths are from heart problems. Physicians have tried to reduce those risks in many ways, but our current approach is expensive, leads to unhelpful testing, and probably doesn't do a very good job reducing the risk of death. This proposal uses a form of machine learning and a large dataset to try to find more personalized, more helpful, and less expensive strategies to try to reduce the risks of surgery, and then tests whether we can present personalized estimates to doctors that they could use when thinking about the risks of surgery.",Personalizing Preoperative Stress Testing Using Machine Learning,9849333,K08HL141598,"['Appointment', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hospital Departments', 'Information Theory', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Observational Study', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Probability', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Stress Tests', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinking', 'Training', 'Weight', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'functional status', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'perioperative mortality', 'personalized approach', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic value', 'randomized trial', 'risk mitigation', 'skills', 'surgical risk', 'therapy development', 'treatment center']",NHLBI,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,K08,2020,161047,0.053970255975960585
"Use of Machine Learning on Integrated Electronic Medical Record, Genetic and Waveform Data to Predict Perioperative Cardiorespiratory Instability Project Summary/Abstract  The objective of this K01 application is to give Dr. Hofer the necessary training and research experience to establish himself as an independent investigator focused on using machine learning (ML) on a variety of healthcare data to predict outcomes during the perioperative period. The career development activities consist of escalating coursework on machine learning beginning with an online course of ML fundamentals and ending with a UCLA course on ML applications in healthcare. Augmenting these courses are tutorials on the application of these techniques to healthcare data and a research program is designed to use ML on healthcare data to predict perioperative cardio-respiratory instability (CRI) – specifically hypotension and arrhythmia.  To achieve these goals, Dr. Hofer has established an outstanding team of leaders in machine learning, perioperative medicine, and clinical informatics. Dr. Maxime Cannesson, his primary mentor, is an expert in perioperative medicine and the use of ML on physiologic signals. Dr. Eran Halperin, the co-mentor for this pro- posal, is an expert in ML and its application to genomic and other healthcare data. Dr. Hofer has ongoing collab- orations with Drs. Cannesson and Halperin on joint projects. Both Drs. Cannesson and Halperin have a strong track record of mentoring individuals who have progressed to independent and productive academic careers. Dr. Hofer will be aided by an advisory committee consisting of Dr. Douglas Bell (who will provide guidance on integrating data from multiple sources), Dr. Mohammed Mahbouba (providing support regarding data security and creating enterprise level analytic solutions) and Dr. Jeanine Wiener-Kronish (providing guidance on the most relevant questions in perioperative outcome prediction).  Challenges managing CRI have been implicated in the more than 15 million annual postoperative com- plications, costing more than $165 billion, however no scores exist to predict CRI. This study will leverage unique infrastructure at UCLA where whole EMR data has been combined with physiologic waveforms and genomic data on more than 30,000 patients. This proposal will use a variety of ML techniques on these data to create predictive models for CRI.  In summary, this proposal will provide Dr. Hofer with both technical training in ML and hands on experi- ence in using ML to predict perioperative outcomes. This study has the potential to create models that will help clinicians predict, and thus avoid, perioperative instability, thereby improving patient outcomes. Additionally, this program will provide Dr. Hofer with the tools he needs to successfully compete for a R01 focusing on using ML models on a variety of healthcare data to predict the downstream effects of CRI – perioperative complications. Project Narrative During the perioperative period hemodynamic instability is the norm rather than the exception; the ability of clinicians to manage this instability has been associated with postoperative complications affecting more than 15 million Americans and costing more than $165 billion each year. There are no current risk scores that predict instability in real time, however the recent widespread adoption of electronic medical records and creation of genomic biobanks creates unique opportunities to develop scores that are both accurate and precise. We will use machine learning techniques to create risk scores for perioperative cardiorespiratory instability – specifically hypotension and arrhythmia – using combined electronic medical record, genomic and physiologic waveform data.","Use of Machine Learning on Integrated Electronic Medical Record, Genetic and Waveform Data to Predict Perioperative Cardiorespiratory Instability",10055690,K01HL150318,"['Acute', 'Adoption', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atlases', 'California', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Databases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Joints', 'Latino', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Perioperative complication', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Subgroup', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'biobank', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'career', 'career development', 'cost', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diverse data', 'electronic data', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'feeding', 'genetic information', 'genetic profiling', 'genomic data', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'long short term memory', 'multiple data sources', 'online course', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'programs', 'random forest', 'structured data', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2020,175284,0.08414431524941822
"Deep Learning Approaches to Detect Glaucoma and Predict Progression from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography Project Abstract / Summary Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is a leading cause of blindness in the United States and worldwide. It is estimated that over 2.2 million Americans suffer from POAG and that over 130,000 are legally blind from the disease. As the population ages, the number of people with POAG in the United States will increase to over 3.3 million in 2020 and worldwide to an estimated 111.8 million by 2040. POAG is a progressive disease associated with characteristic functional and structural changes that clinicians use to diagnose and monitor the disease. Over the past several years, spectral domain optical coherent tomography (SDOCT) has become the standard tool for measuring structure in POAG. This 3D imaging modality provides a wealth of information about retinal structure and POAG-related retinal layers. This large amount of data is hard for clinicians to interpret and use effectively to help guide treatment decisions. Instead, summary metrics such as average layer thicknesses are used to reduce SDOCT images to a handful of values. While these metrics are useful, they can be difficult to interpret and they throwaway important information regarding voxel intensity and texture, relationships across retinal layers, and the overall 3D structure of the retina. Relying too heavily on these metrics limits our ability to gain a deeper understanding structural contributions to POAG, the relationship between structure and visual function, and how structural (and functional) changes progress in POAG. Recent advances in artificial intelligence and deep learning, however, offer new data-driven tools and techniques to interpret 3D SDOCT images and learn from the large SDOCT datasets being collected in clinics around the world. This proposal will apply state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to 3D SDOCT data in order to (1) develop more accurate POAG detection tools, (2) reveal structure-function relationships, and (3) predict structural and functional progression in POAG. This proposal also details a training plan to help the PI transition from a postdoctoral scholar to an independent researcher. The mentored phase of this award will be supervised by the primary mentor, Dr. Linda Zangwill, and a multidisciplinary mentoring team including Dr. Robert Weinreb (Ophthalmology), Dr. David Kriegman (Computer Science and Engineering), and Dr. Armin Schwartzman (Biostatistics). Performing the proposed research, formal coursework, and mentored career development will the provide the PI with highly sought- after skills and experience to help ensure a successful transition into independence. Project Narrative Three-dimensional imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography have become an essential tool in the clinical care of glaucoma and other eye diseases. These imaging techniques provide clinicians with huge amounts of structural information, but interpreting the data and using it effectively to improve outcomes remains challenging in clinical glaucoma management. This project will improve patient care by applying powerful deep learning techniques to provide clinicians with critical decision support information to more accurately detect glaucoma, reveal associations between structure and visual function, and predict glaucoma progression.",Deep Learning Approaches to Detect Glaucoma and Predict Progression from Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography,10055661,K99EY030942,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Technique', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Eye diseases', 'Frequencies', 'Glaucoma', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Open Angle Glaucoma', 'Probability', 'Progressive Disease', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'South Korea', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Visual Fields', 'Visualization', 'Width', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'college', 'computer science', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'field study', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'large datasets', 'legally blind', 'macula', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'research clinical testing', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'sex', 'skills', 'standard measure', 'three dimensional structure', 'tomography', 'tool']",NEI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K99,2020,117347,0.03329195724190309
"Real-time Non-Rigid 3D Reconstruction and Registration for Laparoscopic-guided Minimally Invasive Liver Surgery Project Summary/Abstract Liver deformation leads to difficulties in tumor localization during minimally invasive liver surgery (MILS). The goal of this proposal is to develop an efficient surgical navigation tool for MILS by compensating for liver deformation and mapping preoperative data to the patient’s anatomy. Specifically, we will develop a non-rigid simultaneously localization and mapping (SLAM) approach to estimate the deformation of liver surface from stereo laparoscopy videos. We will develop machine-learning methods to detect landmarks and perform non- rigid registration. The algorithms will be implemented on a GPU to achieve real-time. Preliminary data has demonstrated the feasibility. During the R00 phase, we will mainly address the clinical needs and develop novel ways to provide intraoperative guidance. This project will greatly improve the tumor resection accuracy in MILS. The candidate for this award Dr. Haoyin Zhou is a postdoc at Surgical Planning Laboratory (SPL), Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). Dr. Zhou has extensive experience and expertise in computer vision, machine learning and their applications in medicine. BWH is an international leader in basic, clinical and translational research on human diseases, and has established multiple research programs to promote the work and professional career development of young investigators. National Center for Image Guided Therapy, and Advanced Multi-modality Image Guided Operating (AMIGO) suite will greatly support this research. Dr. Zhou’s long-term research goal is to develop and apply advanced computer vision and machine learning technologies to improve understanding, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases for better health care. His long-term career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the frontier of medical image processing and image-guided therapy. To achieve these goals, Dr. Zhou plans to receive more education and training in the following four areas: (1) Critical training in conducting translational research in the hospital environment with surgeons and radiologists, (2) knowledge in the development of technologies for surgical guidance, (3) training in machine learning and its applications in medicine, and (4) training on writing grant applications independently and seeking funding. Dr. Zhou will participate in formal courses selected from Harvard, Harvard Catalyst, MIT CSAIL and Stanford Courses. He will attend weekly seminars at BWH, HMS and MIT.

The aims of this study are: 1) To build machine learning-based prediction models of tachycardia and hypotension following blood donation using non-invasive waveform data in healthy blood donor volunteers, and create baseline features to compare with circulatory shock 2) To provide an operational definition, prediction models, differentiation of physiologic evolution towards shock, and personalized treatment of circulatory shock in ICU patients. Through this proposal, I will develop advanced skills in machine-learning, clinical bioinformatics, and clinical research. I will complete a Master of Science in Biomedical Informatics to learn advanced data- driven research methodologies to strengthen my technical training. This award will be a critical step towards my long-term goal, being an independent physician scientist, with expertise in prediction analytics in critical care medicine through clinical trials. I have committed mentors Dr. Michael Pinsky (physiology, functional hemodynamics) and Dr. Gilles Clermont (critical care, algorithms, data science) who will ensure successful completion of my proposed aims. My mentoring committee also includes an advisor, Dr. Milos Hauskrecht - a renowned computer scientist in the Computer Science and Information Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. My work will be completed within the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, which has an extensive track record of committing to the development of physician scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Circulatory shock is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients. Early identification or forecasting of shock would be clinically actionable and improve prognosis, but no personalized prediction model for shock has been presented yet.

"Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis ABSTRACT This project outlines technical medical image processing and machine learning developments to study the pathogenesis and natural history of osteoarthritis (OA). In the past few years, the availability of public datasets that collect data such as plain radiographs, MRI genomics and patients reported outcomes has allowed the study of disease etiology, potential treatment pathways and predictors of long-range outcomes, showing an increasingly important role of the MRI. Moreover, recent advances in quantitative MRI and medical image processing allow for the extraction of extraordinarily rich arrays of heterogeneous information on the musculoskeletal system, including cartilage and bone morphology, bone shape features, biomechanics, and cartilage biochemical composition.  Osteoarthritis, being a polygenic and multifactorial disease characterized by several phenotypes, seems the perfect candidate for multidimensional analysis and precision medicine. However, accomplish this ambitious task, will require complex analytics and multifactorial data-integration from diverse assessments spanning morphological, biochemical, and biomechanical features. In this project, we propose to fill this gap developing automatic post-processing algorithms to examine cartilage biochemical compositional and morphological features and to apply new multidimensional machine learning to study OA  This “Pathway to Independence” award application includes a mentored career development plan to transition the candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, into an independent investigator position, as well as an accompanying research plan describing the proposed technical developments for the application of big data analytics to the study of OA. The primary mentor, Dr. Sharmila Majumdar, is a leading expert in the field of quantitative MRI for the study of OA, and the co-mentors, Dr. Adam Ferguson and Dr. Ramakrishna Akella, have extensive experience in the application of machine learning and topological data analysis to big data. The diversified plan of training and the complementary background of these mentors will allow the candidate to develop a unique interdisciplinary profile in the field of musculoskeletal imaging.  The candidate, Dr. Valentina Pedoia, is currently in a post-doctoral level position (Associated Specialist) at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF), developing MR image post-processing algorithms. The mentoring and career development plan will supplement her image processing background with valuable exposure to machine learning, big data analysis, epidemiological study design, and interdisciplinary collaboration to facilitate her transition to a medical imaging and data scientist independent investigator position. Ultimately, she aims to become a faculty member in a radiology or bioengineering institute, where she can further research technical biomedical imaging and machine learning developments applied to the musculoskeletal system. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morphological and compositional MRI quantifications are widely used tools to detect early cartilage degeneration and to study disease progression of osteoarthritis, a complex and multifactorial disorder. In this project, we propose to develop a fully automatic image post-processing pipeline and multidimensional big data analyses based on machine learning techniques, with the aim to uncover latent information from complex dataset and with the ultimate goal of setting up a platform for OA precision medicine",Multidimensional MRI-based Non-Euclidean Deep Learning to Study Osteoarthritis,9934128,R00AR070902,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemistry', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'California', 'Cartilage', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Gait', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal System', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'algorithm development', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'bone', 'career development', 'cartilage degradation', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'feature extraction', 'heterogenous data', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging scientist', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'kinematics', 'member', 'modifiable risk', 'morphometry', 'multidimensional data', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'parallel processing', 'precision medicine', 'quantitative imaging', 'racial difference', 'repository', 'shape analysis', 'soft tissue', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R00,2020,249000,-0.021166548560694134
"Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess and Train Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis during Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT CANDIDATE (Andrew J. Hung, MD): My long-term goal is to establish a career in innovating training methods for robotic surgery which will lead to curtailing surgeon learning curve, and maximize patient safety. My first step towards that goal focuses on understanding objective metrics that measure surgeon performance, and how machine learning algorithms can process that data to guide training. I have developed a career development program that builds on my clinical training in robotic urologic surgery and prior research in surgical training. Through mentorship, a fellowship, and formal coursework, this K23 award will provide me the necessary support to develop expertise in 3 areas where I do not have formal training, yet are critical to my success: (1) Machine learning; (2) Surgical education; (3) Advanced statistical skills and study design. MENTORING TEAM: My career development and research plans leverage existing institutional resources, including the USC Machine Learning Center, led by co-primary mentor Dr. Yan Liu; and Keck Hospital of USC, the second busiest robotic center by volume in the United States and the USC Institute of Urology (led by co- primary mentor and chairman Dr. Inderbir Gill), home to pioneers of several urologic surgical techniques with a robust research apparatus supporting several NIH-funded clinical scientists. My mentoring team is complemented by co-mentor Dr. Robert Sweet, a DOD-funded expert on surgical education; career mentor Dr. Larissa Rodriguez, a federally funded clinician/scientist experienced in mentoring K awardees; educational psychology collaborator Dr. Kenneth Yates, an authority on cognitive task analysis; and consultant Dr. Anthony Jarc, at Intuitive Surgical who has supported much of the pilot data on objective performance metrics. The proposed K23 work truly requires the robust collaboration of experts in robotic surgery, education, and machine learning. RESEARCH: The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) is steep: over 100 cases. Current ‘gold standard’ methods of surgical assessment rely on subjective expert review, but such evaluations are time consuming and inconsistent. Nonetheless, credentialing a surgeon to perform robotic surgery has enormous implications - patient outcomes are at risk, and a surgeon’s career is on the line. Informed by my clinical expertise in robotic urological surgery and preliminary data, I will develop a novel method of utilizing machine learning (ML) algorithms to objectively assess robotic surgeon performance and to guide training for the vesico-urethral anastomosis (VUA), the most critical reconstructive part of the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). I will develop and validate objective metrics directly captured from the da Vinci robot during the VUA (Aim 1), train machine learning algorithms to assess a surgeon’s performance of VUA (Aim 2), and utilize ML algorithms to guide surgeons learning the VUA (Aim 3). Armed with these data and skills from this award, I will be uniquely suited to utilize machine learning to generalize objective surgeon assessment for robot-assisted surgical procedures within and beyond urology. Finally, the results from this study will provide preliminary data for independent funding through mechanisms such as an NIH R01 grant. PROJECT NARRATIVE The learning curve for surgeons performing robot assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) for prostate cancer is steep, and current methods of evaluating surgeons require subjective and time-consuming expert review. Streamlined training and assessment utilizing objective performance metrics and machine learning algorithms can significantly curtail learning curve with patients, and decrease the overall morbidity of prostate cancer treatment.",Development of Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess and Train Vesico-Urethral Anastomosis during Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy,9982955,K23EB026493,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Anastomosis - action', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Chairperson', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Credentialing', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational Intervention', 'Educational Psychology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gills', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Medical Research', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Specialist', 'Surgeon', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urethra', 'Urologic Surgical Procedures', 'Urology', 'Work', 'authority', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive task', 'common treatment', 'complex data ', 'computer program', 'data reduction', 'experience', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'novel', 'patient safety', 'peer', 'reconstruction', 'research and development', 'robot assistance', 'skills', 'success', 'task analysis', 'urologic', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality simulation']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K23,2020,192304,0.0737958782842866
"Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning Abstract Andrew Holbrook, Ph.D., is a Bayesian statistician with a broad background in applied, theoretical and compu- tational data science. His proposed research Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning tackles viral outbreak forecasting by combining Bayesian phylogenetic modeling with ﬂexible, `self-exciting' stochastic process models. The development and publication of open-source, high-performance computing software for his models will facilitate fast epidemiological ﬁeld response in a big data setting. Dr. Holbrook will apply his method- ology to the reconstruction of the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic in the Americas, focusing on identifying key geographical routes of transmission and phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness.  Candidate: Dr. Holbrook is Postdoctoral Scholar at the UCLA Department of Human Genetics. He earned his Ph.D. in Statistics from the Department of Statistics at UC Irvine, during which time he completed his dissertation Geometric Bayes, an investigation into Bayesian modeling and computing on abstract mathematical spaces, and simultaneously participated in scientiﬁc collaborations at the UC Irvine Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. The proposed career development plan will establish Dr. Holbrook as an independent leader in data intensive viral epidemiology by 1) facilitating coursework to build biological domain knowledge, 2) affording Dr. Holbrook the opportunity to lead his own project while remaining under the expert oversight of UCLA Prof. Marc Suchard, M.D., Ph.D., and 3) allowing Dr. Holbrook to continue his focus on quantitative viral epidemiology once he has moved to a faculty commitment.  Mentors: During the ﬁrst three years of the award period, Dr. Holbrook will work closely with Prof. Suchard, continuing their current schedule of weekly meetings. Prof. Suchard is a leading expert in both Bayesian phylo- genetics and high-performance statistical computing; and with his medical background, Prof. Suchard will advise Dr. Holbrook in his expansion of domain knowledge in viral epidemiology. As secondary mentor, Prof. Kristian Andersen, Ph.D., of the Scripps Institute will advise Dr. Holbrook in the impactful application of his statistical and computational methodologies to the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic. Dr. Holbrook and Profs. Suchard and Andersen will maintain their collaborations after the postdoctoral period.  Research: Bayesian phylogenetics successfully reconstructs evolutionary histories but fails to predict viral spread. Self-exciting point processes are devoid of biological insight and fail to account for geographic networks of diffusion. Aim 1 addresses deﬁciencies in these two complementary viral epidemiological modeling techniques by innovating a combined model where the phylogenetic and self-excitatory components support each other. Aim 2 makes widespread adoption a reality by publishing open-source, massively parallel computing software suitable for big data analysis. Aim 3 reconstructs the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic, learns key geographical routes of transmission and identiﬁes phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness. Project Narrative Tracking and predicting viral outbreaks remains an open epidemiological problem with deadly consequences. Dr. Holbrook will attack the problem with his Bayesian phylogenetic Hawkes processes, a class of models tailored to simultaneously reconstruct evolutionary histories and predict viral diffusion dynamics. With the mentorship of Profs. Marc Suchard (primary) and Kristian Andersen (secondary), Dr. Holbrook will develop open-source, high-performance computing software and apply his statistical computing methodology to the analysis of the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic of the Americas, learning key routes of transmission and identifying phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness.",Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning,10039150,K25AI153816,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Air', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Americas', 'Award', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diffusion', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Earthquakes', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Free Will', 'Generations', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Herd Immunity', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Influenza', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Route', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Ships', 'Speed', 'Statistical Computing', 'Stochastic Processes', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Viral', 'Viral Epidemiology', 'Viral Physiology', 'Work', 'ZIKA', 'Zika Virus', 'blind', 'career development', 'epidemiological model', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'insight', 'meetings', 'novel', 'open source', 'parallel computer', 'pathogen', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'statistics', 'transmission process']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K25,2020,106467,-0.010177462829594967
"Differential artery-vein analysis in OCT angiography for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy Abstract: This project aims to establish differential artery-vein analysis in optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), and to validate comprehensive OCTA features for automated classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Early detection, prompt intervention, and reliable assessment of treatment outcomes are essential to prevent irreversible visual loss from DR. It is known that DR can target arteries and veins differently. Therefore, differential artery-vein analysis can provide better performance of DR detection and classification. However, clinical OCTA instruments lack the capability of artery-vein differentiation. During this project, we propose to use quantitative feature analysis of OCT, which is concurrently captured with OCTA, to guide artery- vein differentiation in OCTA. The first aim is to establish automated artery-vein differentiation in OCTA. In coordination with our recently demonstrated blood vessel tracking technique, OCT intensity/geometry features will be used to guide artery-vein differentiation in OCTA automatically. Differential artery-vein analysis of blood vessel tortuosity (BVT), blood vessel caliber (BVC), blood vessel density (BVD), vessel perimeter index (VPI), vessel branching coefficient (VBC), vessel branching angle (VBA), branching width ratio (BWR), fovea avascular zone area (FAZ-A) and FAZ contour irregularity (FAZ-CI) will be implemented. Key success criterion of the aim 1 study is to demonstrate robust artery-vein differentiation in OCTA, and to establish OCTA features for objective detection and classification of DR. The second aim is to validate automated OCTA classification of DR. We propose to employ ensemble machine learning to integrate multiple classifiers to achieve robust OCTA classification of DR. Key success criterion of the aim 2 study is to identify OCTA features and optimal-feature- combination to detect early DR, and to establish the correlations between the OCTA features and clinical biomarkers. The third aim is to verify OCTA prediction and evaluation of DR treatment. Our preliminary OCTA study of diabetic macular edema (DME) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment has shown that BVD can serve as a biomarker predictive of visual improvement. During this project, we plan to test differential artery-vein analysis for DME treatment evaluation. Key success criterion of the aim 3 study is to identify artery-vein features to provide robust prediction and evaluation of DME treatment outcomes. As an alternative approach, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (FCNN) for deep machine leaning based artery-vein and DR classification. Early layers in the FCNN will produce simple features, which will be convolved and filtered into deeper layers to produce complex features for artery-vein and DR classification. Further investigation of the relationship between the new features learned through the machine learning process and clinical biomarkers will allow us to optimize the design for better DR classification. Success of this project will pave the way towards using quantitative OCTA features for early DR detection, objective prediction and assessment of treatment outcomes. Project Narrative This project is to establish quantitative optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) analysis for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy (DR). By translating subjective findings into objective assessments, this study will standardize clinical OCTA for eye disease detection and treatment assessment. In addition, objective OCTA analysis based automated DR classification can foster telemedicine in rural and underserved areas where the access to experienced ophthalmologists is limited.",Differential artery-vein analysis in OCT angiography for objective classification of diabetic retinopathy,9857745,R01EY030842,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Angiography', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Biological Markers', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Caliber', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Eye diseases', 'Fostering', 'Fundus photography', 'Geometry', 'Health Expenditures', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microaneurysm', 'Modernization', 'Ophthalmologist', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Reflex action', 'Retina', 'Retinal Edemas', 'Retinal Hemorrhage', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Veins', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'Width', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'clinical biomarkers', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'diabetic', 'diabetic patient', 'experience', 'fovea centralis', 'fundus imaging', 'global health', 'image registration', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'macular edema', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'rural underserved', 'success', 'support vector machine', 'vascular abnormality']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,362544,0.08834251897269352
"Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images ABSTRACT The goal of this R03 Small Grant Program for NIDDK is to provide additional funding for Dr. Kline to expand upon his work on his K award and apply his expertise to new image acquisitions and problems related to renal imaging. Dr. Kline’s work has piqued the interest of many internal and external investigators and has led to recent collaborations with Drs. Rule, Denic, and Kim. Together with Dr. Erickson, this new research team has prepared this R03 proposal which takes advantage of the unique expertise of each team member. The focus of this proposal is to bridge the gap between microscopic observations and those assessable non-invasively by radiological imaging. To do this, we have established a unique dataset of renal CT imaging data and corresponding biopsy measured nephron densities. We have also generated a large database of gold-standard segmentation data of kidneys, cortical regions, and medullary pyramids. Using this existing data, we propose to: (i) develop tools for segmentation of kidneys, segmentation of individual medullary pyramids, and imputing missing parts of the kidneys outside of the imaged field-of-view in the CT image, and (ii) to establish imaging biomarkers of early CKD, and correlate macroscopic imaging findings to underlying microscopic structure. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic’s outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Aging Kidney Anatomy Study (PI: Rule), which led to the generation of this unique and well characterized dataset. Dr. Kline’s background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly well suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, near the end of this research project Dr. Kline will submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of renal imaging biomarkers. Obtaining this R03 Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline’s transition into a prosperous independent researcher focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. Narrative Non-invasive methods for characterizing micro-structural changes of the kidney during aging as well as in health and disease are currently not possible. This research program proposes to use our existing database of renal imaging and renal biopsy data to bridge the gap between macroscopic radiological findings on computed tomography images to those assessable in microscopic images of renal biopsies. This program will develop new automated methods for performing measurements on the images, as well as use machine/deep learning methods to search for new imaging biomarkers that relate to nephron density and size, as well as establish their usefulness for early chronic kidney disease detection and transplant planning.",Artificial Intelligence-Based Approaches for Renal Structure Characterization in Computed Tomography Images,10040835,R03DK125632,"['Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Albuminuria', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Award', 'Biopsy', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinic', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Hour', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrons', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Stenosis', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Tubular formation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated analysis', 'automated image analysis', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'density', 'early detection biomarkers', 'graft failure', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'learning strategy', 'living kidney donor', 'member', 'microscopic imaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technology', 'personalized decision', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic value', 'programs', 'radiological imaging', 'research clinical testing', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R03,2020,113350,0.02837798517495507
"Outcome-driven Order Set Content Development, Management, and Evaluation Project Summary Candidate Goals and Objectives: With a background in Information Systems and Management, and Biostatistics, Dr. Zhang has demonstrated research records on electronic health record data mining to identify patterns of healthcare delivery that may be used to inform patient-centered and evidence-based healthcare. The proposal will provide additional training for Dr. Zhang on advanced machine learning, statistics, and evaluation methods in biomedical informatics for applications on clinical decision support (CDS). Dr. Zhang's long-term goal is to bringing innovation CDS development and evaluation through novel biomedical informatics and data science techniques. Institutional Environment and Career Development: Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) provides ideal research facilities and training environment for Dr. Zhang. Dr. Jyotishman Pathak, Chief of Division of Health Informatics at Department of Health Policy and Research, will lead a multidisciplinary team of mentors: Drs. Jessica Ancker and Fei Wang at WCM, and Dr. Adam Wright at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Zhang also has collaborators in WCM and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital who will support her in her training and research activities and provide clinical expertise. Research Aims Order sets are a type of CDS in computerized provider order entry (CPOE) to standardize decision making in the ordering process and encourage compliance with clinical practice guidelines. Previous literature on order set use has focused its effect on usability, workload, and physician satisfaction, but a knowledge gap remains with respect to the effect of order sets on care outcomes. The overall goal of the research study is to create a continuous improvement cycle for order sets with respect to a care outcome by rigorously learning from data. Aim 1 of the study will apply computational phenotyping and subtyping algorithms to identify cohorts of heart failure (HF) subtypes. Aim 2 will evaluate an existing order set intended for the care of HF patients on a care outcome defined as 30-day all-cause, unplanned readmission with a hypothesis that the use of this order set is associated with a better outcome. This will be achieved by building a range of outcome prediction models and evaluating the strength of each order set order as a predictor. Aim 3 will optimize the existing order sets using a metaheuristic optimization method such that its content collectively may have the largest positive effect on the outcome of 30-day all-cause unplanned readmission. The effects of order set use on the care outcome is measured using a causal inference technique in each iteration. The expected outcome is a framework to develop and evaluate HF order sets which may eventually be generalized to other clinical areas. Training from this proposal may lead to multi-site R01 studies of outcome-driven HF order sets and actual implementations.

"Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches Candidate: Dr. Tedeschi is an Instructor in Medicine at Harvard Medical School (HMS) and Associate Physician in the Division of Rheumatology, Immunology and Allergy’s Section of Clinical Sciences (SCS) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH). She received an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health (HSPH). Her 10 first-author manuscripts, two BWH grants, and foundation award exemplify her productivity and commitment to research. She has assembled an experienced team of mentors and collaborators, led by Dr. Daniel Solomon (primary mentor) and Drs. Katherine Liao and Karen Costenbader (co-mentors), to guide her training in natural language processing and machine learning approaches for clinical research, analysis of linked electronic medical record (EMR) and Medicare claims data, and interpretation of advanced imaging modalities. Focused coursework at HSPH and HMS will complement the experience she gains through her proposed studies of pseudogout risk factors and long-term outcomes. Training in dual- energy CT and ultrasound interpretation for crystalline arthritis will be obtained via one-on-one sessions. Her long-term career goal is to become an independent patient-oriented investigator focused on pseudogout. Environment: Dr. Tedeschi has a commitment from her Division for >75% protected time for research and career development activities during the K23 award period. Support from the Division and her primary mentor’s research funds will supplement her salary and project-related expenses. The SCS, a collaborative clinical research group in the Division of Rheumatology, has extensive infrastructure including the VERITY Bioinformatics Core (NIH-P30-AR072577, PI: Solomon) that will provide resources and expertise for the proposed studies. In addition, the BWH Arthritis Center is one of the largest nationally, facilitating subject recruitment, and the BWH Division of Musculoskeletal Imaging has state-of-the-art equipment and expertise applying dual-energy CT in crystalline arthritis. Coursework at HSPH and HMS, adjacent to BWH, will provide training necessary for Dr. Tedeschi’s development into an independent investigator. Research: Dr. Tedeschi’s long-term objective is to prevent and reduce morbidity from pseudogout, an understudied, painful crystalline arthritis that affects 8-10 million Americans. She will use natural language processing and machine learning approaches to enhance an algorithm for identifying pseudogout in EMR data. She will study risk factors for and long-term outcomes in pseudogout, harnessing vast amounts of information contained in Partners HealthCare EMR data and Medicare claims data, and will gain experience working with linked datasets. Dr. Tedeschi will recruit subjects with pseudogout and other types of mono- and oligoarthritis to test and compare the performance of dual-energy CT scanning, musculoskeletal ultrasound, and x-ray for identifying pseudogout. Her proposed K23 projects will lead to manuscripts and data to be leveraged in an R01 application focused on pseudogout during the award period, leading to independence as a patient-oriented investigator. Project Narrative The proposed studies will contribute fundamental knowledge about pseudogout, a common, painful crystalline arthritis for which we have little prognostic information and no targeted treatments. Results from the proposed projects could lead to methods for non-invasive, accurate pseudogout diagnosis, development of preventive strategies for pseudogout, and interventions to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Future work stemming from the proposed projects may include predictive models of pseudogout flares, identification of serum biomarkers for pseudogout, and development of outcomes measures to be used in prospectively recruited pseudogout cohort studies.",Studying pseudogout using naturallanguage processing and novelimaging approaches,9882206,K23AR075070,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Calcium Pyrophosphate', 'Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diuretics', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Event', 'Female', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Gout', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Image', 'Immunology', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Insurance Claim Review', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pain', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Polyarthritides', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Productivity', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors', 'Pseudogout', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Synovial Fluid', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vascular calcification', 'Vascularization', 'Visit', 'Wages', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'bisphosphonate', 'calcium indicator', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'crystallinity', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'high risk', 'human old age (65+)', 'imaging modality', 'instructor', 'longitudinal course', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'musculoskeletal ultrasound', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'patient oriented', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ranpirnase', 'recruit', 'research and development', 'sex', 'side effect', 'stem', 'structured data', 'targeted treatment', 'unnecessary treatment']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K23,2020,176541,0.07170789336603792
"Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This career development award will provide early career support for investigation of the management of infec- tious diseases in the setting of addiction in hospitals. The award will provide support for the candidate to develop expertise in the following areas: 1) addiction science research; 2) natural language processing; 3) machine learn- ing; 4) professional development; and 5) responsible conduct of research. For this, Dr. Goodman-Meza will be mentored by a multidisciplinary, cross-institutional team with expertise in addiction, infectious diseases, and data science. His primary mentor, Dr. Steve Shoptaw, has an extensive track record in addiction-related research and training of future independent investigators. His co-mentors include Dr. Alex Bui and Dr. Matthew B. Goetz. Dr. Bui is an expert in biomedical data science and heads NIH training programs in this field. Dr. Goetz has broad experience of productive infectious diseases clinical research within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). The current opioid epidemic in the United States has been associated with an increase in infections, in particular hepatitis C and bacterial infections. Bacterial infections are the leading infectious diagnosis leading to hospitali- zation in individuals with an opioid use disorder (OUD), and incur significant healthcare expenditures. Despite the availability of opioid agonist therapy (OAT) in the form of methadone or buprenorphine, less than 20% of people with OUD actually receive OAT. Hospitalization for a bacterial infection may be an ideal time to initiate OAT, but the benefits of this practice are unknown. In this proposal, the candidate will assess the impact of initiating OAT in people who inject opioids admitted to the VHA due to a Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection (bacteremia) – the most common bacterial pathogen among people who inject opioids. Using data already collected for 36,868 cases of S. aureus bacteremia (SAB) from the VHA electronic data repository, the candidate will address three research questions: 1) is a natural language processing algorithm (NLP) more ac- curate than a standard International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code-based approach at screening records to correctly identify individuals who inject opioids in a cohort of patients admitted with SAB; 2) what are the temporal and geographic trends of SAB in people who inject opioids and those who receive OAT at the facility- level; and 3) using a machine learning framework, what are the estimated impacts of OAT on patient centered outcomes – death, readmissions, leaving against medical advice, and subsequent outpatient engagement in OAT. These formative data will help the candidate to establish a productive early career as a physician-scientist and advise development of an OAT-delivery strategy to mitigate infectious complications of injection opioid use. Through this award, Dr. Goodman-Meza will establish himself as an expert physician-scientist at the intersection of infectious disease and addiction, poised to make significant contributions to this important area of medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Serious, life-threatening bacterial infections in people who inject drugs are increasing with the current national opioid epidemic. Hospitalization of people who use opioids for treatment of infectious complications may be an ideal time to initiate opioid agonist therapy (OAT), an evidence-based practice that has been historically underuti- lized. This project will use innovative data science methods to estimate the impact of initiating OAT in the hospital for patients with a history of opioid injection admitted for treatment of blood stream infections caused by Staph- ylococcus aureus in the Veterans Health Administration.",Using data science to measure the impact of opioid agonist therapy in patients admitted with Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infections,9951022,K08DA048163,"['Acute suppurative arthritis due to bacteria', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Buprenorphine', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Research', 'Coagulation Process', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distant', 'Drug usage', 'Economic Burden', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Embolism', 'Endocarditis', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Evidence based practice', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'HIV risk', 'Head', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hepatitis C Transmission', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injecting drug user', 'International Classification of Disease Codes', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Life', 'Location', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Predisposition', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Thrombus', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Water', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'blood treatment', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'cohort', 'data format', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health administration', 'heroin use', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'injection drug use', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'opioid agonist therapy', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid injection', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid use', 'opioid use disorder', 'opioid user', 'overdose death', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'pathogenic virus', 'prescription opioid', 'responsible research conduct', 'screening', 'skin microbiota', 'time interval', 'treatment services', 'trend', 'viral transmission']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K08,2020,203040,0.0693116515921385
"Deep learning approaches to decipher the impact of mobile element insertion on alternative splicing in neurological disorders The purpose of this training and research application is to study the functional impact of mobile element insertions (MEIs) in neurological disorders (NDs) using new developments in deep learning techniques. MEIs are transposable DNA fragments that are able to insert throughout the human genome. There are at least 124 independent MEIs associated with human diseases. Approximately 20% of these diseases represent a spectrum of NDs, yet the overall contribute of MEIs to the etiology of NDs has not been systematically estimated. To address this, we will (1) characterize functional MEIs in GTEx cohorts in healthy individuals; (2) build a comprehensive functional map of MEIs to determine tissue-specific and brain-specific impact; and (3) impute transcriptional changes on various NDs where whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data will be generated. The proposed application will also develop an extensive research program for Dr. Dadi Gao, a computational biologist and statistical geneticist who has trained in functional genomic studies of alternative splicing in neurodegenerative disorders and therapeutic targeting of a splicing defect that causes a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. He has developed novel methods to investigate regulation of the transcriptome and to facilitate analyses in drug development. He now seeks to expand his expertise by applying statistical and deep learning models on large cohorts of sequencing data from controls and cases with NDs from post-mortem tissues, then impute functional consequences of MEIs from WGS in large-scale disease cohorts. The training plan consists of two years of mentored research to learn new skills in genome analysis, MEI characterization, and advanced deep learning techniques, followed by three years of shaping an independent laboratory. The research plan is developed to comprehensively explore functional variation in the genome by decomposing transcriptomic changes against MEIs. Dr. Michael Talkowski at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard, and the Broad Institute will serve as the primary mentor, while Dr. Manolis Kellis at MIT and the MIT Computational Biology Group, and the Broad Institute will serve as a co-mentor and close collaborator. These mentors are recognized experts in genomic structural variants, functional genomics, the genetics of neurological disorders, and computational modeling to establish functional elements in the human genome. In addition, a team of independent investigators from basic and translational research will provide Dr. Gao with comprehensive feedback to keep both his science and career development on track. The highly collaborative environment in CGM, MGH, Harvard Medical School, the Broad Institute and the University of Michigan Medical School will prepare Dr. Gao for his transition to an independent investigator. This outstanding mentorship team and training program will facilitate the career development of Dr. Gao as he seeks to redefine the functional maps of MEIs in the human genome and to impute their impact in large-scale neurological disorders. Mobile element insertions (MEIs) represent a largely undefined component of the genetic architecture of neurological disorders, as a number of MEIs have been associated with alternative splicing in these disorders but large-scale genome-wide functional characterization has not been systematically performed across tissues. This program study will functionally characterize the impact of MEIs on alternative splicing from whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing in large cohorts using new developments in deep learning models. These results will enhance our understanding of the etiological role and pathogenic mechanisms associated with MEIs in neuronal development and human neurological disorders.",Deep learning approaches to decipher the impact of mobile element insertion on alternative splicing in neurological disorders,10041366,K99NS118109,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autopsy', 'Basic Science', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Pairing', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dorsal', 'Dystonia', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Excision Repair', 'Familial Dysautonomia', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Filipino', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Haplotypes', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Introns', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mind', 'Minisatellite Repeats', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mosaicism', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retroelements', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Short Interspersed Nucleotide Elements', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'TAF1 gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Tissue-Specific Splicing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcription Alteration', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'career development', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'functional genomics', 'functional outcomes', 'gene function', 'genetic architecture', 'genome analysis', 'genome editing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'in silico', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'mind control', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'structural genomics', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2020,91226,0.020934867250719243
"Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning This is a K23 award application for Dr. Andrew Sweatt, a pulmonary/critical care physician and young investigator at Stanford University who is establishing a niche in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) precision phenotyping. His work centers on using machine learning to reclassify PAH, where hidden patterns are detected in high-throughput molecular data to uncover new phenotypes. The existing PAH clinical classification does not inform therapy decisions, and outcomes are overall poor with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ treatment approach. There is a critical need for molecular phenotyping efforts, to develop classification schemes that sit closer to pathobiology and identify therapeutically-targetable patient subsets. Dr. Sweatt’s K23 builds on an innovative foundational study where he used machine learning to cluster PAH patients based on blood immune profiling, without guidance from clinical features. This agnostic approach uncovered 4 immune phenotypes with distinct cytokine profiles that are independent of clinical subtypes and stratify disease risk. These findings indicate that inflammation is a viable platform for PAH reclassification. Extensive research has implicated inflammation in PAH and multiple immune-targeting therapies are under active investigation, but these studies rest on the assumption that a common pathophenotype exists. The objective of Dr. Sweatt’s K23 is to better understand PAH immune phenotypes in terms of their longitudinal evolution, mechanistic underpinnings, and therapeutic implications. First, he will perform serial cytokine profiling in two observational cohorts (Stanford, USA; Sheffield, UK) to reassess immune phenotypes during the disease course (Aim 1). Based on preliminary data, dynamic phenotype switches may occur in some patients and reflect changes in clinical disease severity. Next, he will integrate blood transcriptomic profiling and apply sophisticated computational tools to provide phenotype-specific mechanistic insights (Aim 2). He postulates that distinct transcriptomic profiles will link phenotypes to specific signaling pathways and immune cell subsets. Findings will be validated using multi-cohort data from public repositories. Finally, he will perform post-hoc cytokine profiling in two recent PAH trial cohorts where immune modulators were tested, to assess if therapy responses differ across phenotypes (Aim 3). His research could help identify patients who will respond to specific therapies, inform clinical trial designs, lead to biomarker discovery, and define novel biology in PAH. The K23 will provide Dr. Sweatt with the critical support needed to transition to an independent research career and be a leader in PAH precision phenotyping. His K23 objectives are to gain experience in PAH clinical phenotyping/cohort building, expand expertise in bioinformatics, cultivate collaboration, and translate findings to new hypotheses for R01 development. He will be guided by a committed team of multidisciplinary mentors (Roham Zamanian [expert in PAH clinical trial design/biomarkers], Marlene Rabinovitch [leader in translational PAH research], and Purvesh Khatri [pioneer in bioinformatics]) and scientific advisors (Mark Nicolls [translational PAH immunology], PJ Utz [immunology], and Manisha Desai [biostatistics]). NARRATIVE This proposed research is aimed at classifying novel subtypes of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), by studying inflammation in the blood of patients (complex protein and genetic profiles) and using sophisticated computational methods (machine learning and systems-based network analysis) to find data patterns that would otherwise remain hidden. This research is relevant to public health as the burden of morbidity and mortality is high in PAH, and the current system used to classify patients does not inform treatment decisions. Our project has significant potential to improve public health, as it may yield a PAH classification scheme that sits closer to underlying pathobiology, provide a critical step toward identifying patients who will respond to specific therapies, help improve the design of forthcoming clinical trials, and create a framework for precision medicine.",Reclassifying Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Into Immune Phenotypes Using Machine Learning,9953139,K23HL151892,"['Address', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Growth Factor', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immunity', 'Immunology', 'Immunomodulators', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mononuclear', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Public Health', 'Rare Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Pathway', 'System', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'career', 'chemokine', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical subtypes', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cytokine', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'differential expression', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'genetic profiling', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prospective', 'protein complex', 'protein profiling', 'public repository', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'trend']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,193536,0.033047256722159676
"Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings Project Summary: Darwin Babino, PhD, a trained pharmacologist/electrophysiologist, has spent the last ten years working on several disciplines in the vision sciences. His proposal entitled “Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings” presents his overarching goal to improve vision restoration approaches by developing methods to test the potential of these techniques thereby accelerating the development of effective interventions. Dr. Babino and his primary mentor, Dr. Russell Van Gelder, have assembled a strong team of co-mentors at the University of Washington SOM and collaborators to guide him through the proposed training and research. His previous training will be supplemented with goals to help his development as an independent investigator: 1) Study design and practical learning in performing panretinal (MEA) biological experiments; 2) Fundamental and advanced techniques of the proposed optogenetic and stem-cell restoration techniques; 3) Application of advanced machine learning techniques; 4) Develop leadership and professional skills to establish an independent group. The ability to assess the function of panretinal circuitry will foster our understanding of the advantages and weaknesses of different restoration techniques (Aim 1). The work proposed here will improve an existing retinal acuity assessment tool which combines machine learning techniques on novel, high-density multielectrode array recordings of ganglion cell responses in several mouse models. The utility of this system will be demonstrated in assessing visual potential of the mouse retina in three different approaches to vision restoration that are challenging for in vivo assessment (Aim 2). In collaboration with Dr. Deepak A. Lamba at UCSF, we will apply our system to animals which have undergone stem-cell replacement of retinal cells including photoreceptor cells. An optogenetics approach will also be evaluated in collaboration with Dr. John Flannery at UC Berkeley whose group has developed vectors for expressing rhodopsin and cone opsins in ganglion and bipolar cells. Finally, differences between native and restored vison with small molecule photoswitches, light-activated inhibitors of voltage-gated potassium channels, which confer light-dependent firing on treated cells, will be assessed. The resulting advanced electrophysiology application will help elucidate fundamental questions about the functional retina, mechanisms that lead to retinal degeneration and the potential of several therapeutics for the treatment of retinal diseases. Furthermore, this career development award will facilitate Dr. Babino’s development into an independent investigator by priming an R01 grant application. Project Narrative: Project Narrative: The prevalence of vision loss from retinal degeneration numbers in the millions world-wide and is expected to double by the year 2050, and despite the development of several promising approaches to restore vision in the blind, progress in developing these therapies has been hampered by challenges in analysis of these methods in animal models. We describe a novel system that analyzes, by machine learning, retinal ganglion cell output in native, degenerated and therapeutically treated blind retinas which can characterize the visual information content of the ‘reanimated’ blind retina and thereby facilitate the development of these technologies. The system developed through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to the assessment of potential retinal acuity restoration by current and novel therapeutic approaches.",Assessment of murine retinal acuity ex vivo by machine learning of multielectrode array recordings,9943144,K99EY031333,"['Aftercare', 'Amacrine Cells', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Applications Grants', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Blindness', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Cone', 'Contrast Sensitivity', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Dissection', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ectopic Expression', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Electroretinography', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Ganglia', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Light', 'MW opsin', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Opsin', 'Output', 'Photoreceptors', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Retinal Cone', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Retinal gene therapy', 'Rhodopsin', 'Rod', 'Rodent', 'Saccades', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Synapsins', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Universities', 'Vertebrate Photoreceptors', 'Viral', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Acuity', 'Visual system structure', 'Voltage-Gated Potassium Channel', 'Washington', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior test', 'blind', 'career development', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'density', 'effective intervention', 'experimental study', 'ganglion cell', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interest', 'light intensity', 'mimicry', 'mouse model', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'mutant', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'promoter', 'rapid eye movement', 'response', 'restoration', 'scale up', 'skills', 'small molecule', 'stem cells', 'technology development', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'vector', 'vision science', 'visual information']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,113080,0.03878374734662543
"Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression Osteoarthritis (OA) affects 14 million individuals in the US and over 300 million adults worldwide. The disease is characterized by joint pain and functional limitations and is associated with poor health- related quality of life and increased healthcare utilization. OA of the hips and knees ranks as the 11th highest contributor to global disability. Despite the clinical and economic impact of knee OA, no disease-modifying agents are currently available; current treatments are limited to symptom control and are only modestly efficacious. While several promising treatments are in the pipeline, developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. We urgently need to identify the right patient for the right treatment to ensure that new therapies are being tested on the appropriate population. This proposal aims to use machine learning methods to address gaps in our understanding of disease heterogeneity in knee OA. We will use publicly available data from the FNIH OA Biomarkers Consortium project. This study of 600 subjects with knee OA includes over 200 parameters that describe the joint structure and disease severity, including measures of cartilage, bone, ligaments, menisci, and inflammation. An unsupervised learning approach using model-based clustering will be used to distinguish disease phenotypes. To implement phenotyping in practice a minimal set of biomarkers must be identified that meets the challenges of both predictive accuracy and feasibility. Thus the second aim will investigate variable selection methods in model-based clustering in order to identify important variables and develop a prediction model to determine phenotype. Finally, a supervised machine learning approach via super learning will investigate algorithms to predict disease progression. The applicant, Dr. Jamie Collins, is a biostatistician at the Orthopedic and Arthritis Center for Outcomes Research at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Dr. Collins is a committed investigator in rheumatology research with eight first author publications in the field. She holds a career development award from the Rheumatology Research Foundation and pilot funding from the Brigham Research Institute. This proposal will provide protected time and rigorous training so that the applicant can expand her current biostatistical skill set to encompass the burgeoning fields of data science and machine learning. She will take coursework at the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health and will have access to courses, seminars, and training provided by the Brigham Research Institute and the Harvard Catalyst Program. The applicant will be supported by mentorship from Drs. Elena Losina and Tuhina Neogi, and input from the advisory committee of Drs. Tianxi Cai, Jeffrey Duryea, Ali Guermazi, Tina Kapur, Virginia Kraus, Katherine Liao, and Kurt Spindler. The research and training proposed in this award will address critical research gaps in our understanding of OA heterogeneity and progression. This will set Dr. Collins on the path towards independence and her long-term career objective of being an independent investigator with a focus on applying advanced analytic methods in OA research. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic disabling disease that affects millions of people worldwide; there is an urgent need to develop effective therapies capable of providing symptom control and arresting structural progression. Developing and testing treatments for OA is complicated by disease heterogeneity. The proposed work will identify disease phenotypes in knee OA that will allow for the assessment of heterogeneity of treatment effect in clinical trials and ultimately lead to the development of targeted interventions and therapies.",Data-driven approaches in defining knee osteoarthritis phenotypes and factors  associated with fast progression,9976687,K01AR075879,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Arthralgia', 'Arthritis', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Cartilage', 'Catabolism', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hip Osteoarthritis', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Ligaments', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Orthopedics', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Rights', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rheumatology', 'Right to Treatments', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synovial Membrane', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Virginia', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'aging population', 'analytical method', 'base', 'bone', 'career', 'career development', 'catalyst', 'complex data ', 'disability', 'disabling disease', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'economic impact', 'effective therapy', 'health care service utilization', 'health related quality of life', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'skills', 'supervised learning', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'unsupervised learning']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2020,130950,0.04625825740403392
"Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting Project Summary/Abstract The candidate and principal investigator (PI) Geoffrey Tison, MD, MPH, is an Assistant Professor in the Divi- sion of Cardiology at the University of California, San Francisco. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent clinician-investigator with the training necessary to perform technology-leveraged clinical research to both investigate and facilitate cardiovascular disease prevention. Specifically, the training aims of this award will allow the PI to build upon his existing clinical research and data analysis skills to employ machine learning and other technology-based solutions, like mobile health tools, to advance heart failure prevention. The candi- date will complete coursework to develop his skills in machine learning, medical informatics, and clinical trial design and implementation, taking part in the UCSF Medical Informatics Training Program. To achieve these training goals, the candidate has assembled a mentoring team with extensive and complimentary expertise in clinical trials, epidemiology, and technology-enabled research (Dr. Jeff Olgin, the primary mentor, Dr. Mark Pletcher, Dr. Veronique Roger), biomedical/clinical informatics and novel data analysis (Dr. Atul Butte) and heart failure clinical and research expertise (Dr. Liviu Klein, Dr. Veronique Roger, Dr. John Spertus). This pro- ject seeks to take advantage of our current digital medical era to remotely capture individualized up-to-date patient data and predict dynamic risk, addressing the unmet need to improve remote heart failure management and decrease heart failure hospitalization. The project will test and develop tools to predict dynamic heart fail- ure risk based on real-time data measured in a free-living heart failure population—using a novel smartphone- based tool—and from patterns in up-to-date EHR data. The specific aims are: Aim 1–! Examine changes in functional status, measured by serial Self-Administered 6 Minute Walk Test, as a predictor of near-term HF hospitalization. Aim 2–! Develop a “dynamic” heart failure risk model that incorporates four types of up-to-date EHR data as it becomes available—including encounters, medication refills/changes, labs and vital signs. This research is expected to produce two validated methods to estimate dynamic, up-to-date heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization. This con- tribution has the potential to improve remote management for heart failure patients, while shifting the clinical care paradigm to utilize dynamic, longitudinal and free-living data for clinical decision-making. This award will directly enable a future R01-level randomized pragmatic clinical to trial test the hypothesis that delivery of up- to-date risk information to outpatient clinicians can decrease future HF hospitalizations. This award will provide the PI with a unique combination of skills: a strong clinical background, a rigorous clinical research foundation, advanced analytic skills in machine learning and fluency to utilize health-related technologies to derive insights and deliver preventive interventions. Project Narrative Heart failure is the number one cause of hospital readmission in those over 65 years of age and the current standard-of-care of weight self-monitoring is inadequate to predict exacerbation. This project aims to improve the monitoring of heart failure disease progression through the use of real-time, up-to-date data obtained both from a smartphone-based tool and from the electronic health record. The goal is to develop a low-risk, clinically validated method to estimate dynamic heart failure risk to enable the provision of earlier, more effective outpatient interventions that decrease hospitalization.",Dynamic prediction of heart failure using real-time functional status and EHR data in the ambulatory setting,9847997,K23HL135274,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Age-Years', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Award', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'California', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'San Francisco', 'Self Administration', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Theory of Change', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Walking', 'Weight', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'behavior change', 'big biomedical data', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'digital', 'experience', 'functional status', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'multiple data sources', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preempt', 'prevent', 'professor', 'skills', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,203397,0.03998486233582003
"Dynamic neural systems underlying socioemotional function PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application for a Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) from Dr. Lorenzo Pasquini, a postdoctoral scholar in clinical neuroimaging at the Memory and Aging Center (MAC), University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Dr. Pasquini is an early-career neuroscientist investigating the neural systems underlying socioemotional symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases. Dr. Pasquini has a strong background in neuroscience, clinical neuroimaging, and machine-learning techniques, but he requires mentored research and high-level training in four different areas to become established as an independent investigator. The training and research program outlined in this proposal will provide Dr. Pasquini with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: 1) gain extended expertize in the clinical manifestation of socioemotional symptoms among elderly populations; 2) achieve proficiency in analysis of multimodal dynamic systems through the application of cutting-edge machine-learning algorithms; 3) get proficiency in the analysis of autonomic physiological recordings; and 4) develop an independent research career niche based on scientific productivity and grant applications. To achieve these goals, Dr. Pasquini has assembled a mentorship team including a primary mentor, Dr. William Seeley, a behavioral neurologist with deep expertize in neuroanatomy and neuroimaging of neurodegenerative diseases; a co-mentor, Dr. Virginia Sturm, a clinical psychologist who investigates autonomic and socioemotional deficits across distinct dementia syndromes; a second co-mentor, Dr. Manish Saggar, a computational neuroscientist developing computational methods to map dynamic brain activity in healthy and psychiatric populations; and a significant contributor, Dr. Isabel Allen, a statistician expert in machine-learning. This proposal describes the application of innovative techniques that aim to elucidate how the autonomic system and the brain dynamically interact to shape emotions and social behavior in healthy controls and patients with neurodegenerative syndromes. By leveraging the neuroanatomical and autonomic deficits found in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), Dr. Pasquini seeks to identify the fundamental properties of neural systems underlying socioemotional well-being, with important implications for psychiatry where the neurobiology underlying affective disorders is not well understood. Dr. Pasquini will first delineate deficits in dynamic brain network organization in patients with bvFTD and explore the relationship to socioemotional symptoms (Aim 1). Dr. Pasquini will proceed by identifying deficits in dynamic autonomic outflow in patients with bvFTD and assess the neural correlates through separately acquired neuroimaging (Aim 2). Finally, Dr. Pasquini will capitalize on multimodal simultaneous acquisitions of autonomic outflow and brain network imaging acquired in healthy older controls to explore how both systems dynamically interact to sustain human emotions and social behavior (Exploratory Aim 3). The proposed training will allow Dr. Pasquini to develop a scientific niche and conduct his research with world-class mentorship, paving the way for his career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The neurobiological basis of socioemotional symptoms, a debilitating feature of many neurological and psychiatric disorders, is not well understood. The brain and autonomic nervous system cohesively interact to support socioemotional well-being, and cutting-edge analytical techniques can now reveal the rich dynamic properties of these systems. By leveraging behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, a neurodegenerative disease of socioemotional deficits that targets these systems, the goal of the proposed project is to determine how autonomic and functional brain network dynamics shape human emotions and social behavior in healthy and clinical populations.",Dynamic neural systems underlying socioemotional function,10055555,K99AG065457,"['Affective Symptoms', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Autonomic nervous system', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Breathing', 'California', 'Clinical', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Educational Status', 'Elderly', 'Emotions', 'Empathy', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychologist', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia', 'career', 'cohesion', 'dynamic system', 'fundamental research', 'geriatric neuropsychiatry', 'healthy aging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2020,125010,0.08129198950012864
"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Project Summary of Work The purpose of this administrative supplement application is to provide support for Dr. Alexandra Bey, a psychiatry resident and neuroscience researcher, to expand her opportunities to carry out translational neuroscience research during her clinical training. By conducting the project outlined in this grant, Dr. Bey will gain invaluable experience in new scientific techniques, will study a behavior and its underlying neural dynamics extremely important to neuropsychiatric illnesses, and obtain personalized mentorship that will prepare her for an independent scientific career. To her accomplished skillset in molecular genetics and mouse behavior, she will develop electrophysiology and machine learning techniques in order to advance her ability to study neuronal circuits relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders. Through supervision by Dr. Kafui Dzirasa, Dr. Bey will receive intensive mentorship on experimental design, data analysis, manuscript publication, and grant-writing in order to prepare her to run a research group and compete for independent funding. Additionally, through regular counsel from a committee of preeminent clinician-scientists, Dr. Bey will obtain guidance and support for developing as a psychiatrist-neuroscientist as well as obtain relevant clinical exposure to patients with autism. Dr. Bey and Dr. Dzirasa have developed the following research project to investigate the neural dynamics of sleep. Furthermore, sleep as a behavior is quantifiable, translational, and frequently disrupted in many psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. At present, there is very limited understanding of neural networks underlying sleep architecture. Dr. Bey’s experience with generating and characterizing different genetic mouse models of neuropsychiatric disorders uniquely poise her to advance her skillset to include techniques to truly dissect neural circuits, networks, and their dynamics. Utilizing Dr. Dzirasa’s expertise in in vivo electrophysiology, our collaborator Dr. David Carlson’s expertise in machine learning, we will support Dr. Bey in her efforts to: 1) obtain multisite in vivo electrophysiological recordings in mouse models of neuropsychiatric disease during sleep and wake states, 2) utilize machine-learning algorithms to identify altered neural circuit oscillations contributing to sleep architecture, and 3) extend this work to include a clinically relevant genetic manipulation to examine gene x stress interaction on the dynamics of sleep. Dr. Bey will be a key contributor to the development of each of these experiments and through their conduct, will develop expertise in measuring and understanding neural circuit function which will allow her to advance her career in studying the neurobiological basis of autism. Project Narrative Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,10085101,R01MH120158,"['129 Mouse', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Counseling', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manuscripts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Polysomnography', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Architecture', 'Sleep Wake Cycle', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Sucrose', 'Supervision', 'Tail Suspension', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Writing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'common symptom', 'depression model', 'disabling symptom', 'emotional functioning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic manipulation', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'network architecture', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'non rapid eye movement', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'parent grant', 'preference', 'rapid eye movement', 'relating to nervous system', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'stress tolerance', 'translational neuroscience']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,24205,-0.03626496080268517
"Statistical methods for the assessment of social engagement in psychosis using digital technologies ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Linda Valeri, a biostatistician at McLean Hospital and the Harvard Medical School. Dr. Valeri is establishing herself as a young investigator in psychiatric biostatistics focusing on psychotic disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Valeri with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become expert in psychiatric biostatistics focusing on mobile health (mhealth) research for psychotic disorders (2) to conduct investigations using mhealth technologies in patients with psychosis; (3) to develop automated software for advanced machine learning methods in mhealth studies; and (4) to develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Valeri has assembled a team comprised of three mentors, Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness, and co-mentors Dr. Russell Schutt, Professor of Sociology at University of Massachusetts in Boston, who has extensive experience in the study of social interactions in patients with severe mental illness, and Dr. Jukka-Pekka Onnela, Associate Professor of Biostatistics at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, who has developed a platform for collection of raw sensor data from mobile devices, called “Beiwe”, and conducts research in the fields of digital phenotyping and network science. Dr. Valeri’s research will focus on the development of statistical methods for the analysis of mhealth data to shed light on the role of social engagement in psychosis. The proposal builds upon the hypothesis that social interactions captured by passive mobile data streams (call and text logs) and mobile surveys are potential targets of intervention and could lead to a sustained recovery by promoting perceived social support and improving psychiatric symptoms. In Aim 1(a) we propose to extend a machine learning approach, Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression, for the analysis of mobile data streams accounting for time- varying confounding. The approach will allow in Aim 1(b) to establish (i) reliable links between a high dimensional time series of passive measures of social and mobility behaviors with self-reported measures of social interaction and (ii) the effect of social interaction dynamics on perceived social support and psychiatric symptoms measured in clinical settings. Further, we will extend the approach to correct for selection bias introduced by missing data in mobile surveys (Aim 2). For both aims, Dr. Valeri will develop software (Aim 3) and apply the approaches to investigate these scientific questions using data from an ongoing study based at McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division that employs the smartphone platform for collection of sensor data developed by Dr. Onnela. Dr. Valeri’s investigation will provide preliminary evidence on features and timing of social interaction behaviors that can improve psychiatric symptoms along with understanding of potential mechanisms of action. This research will form the basis for an intervention study that encourages social interactions of patients with psychosis, to be proposed in a future R01 application. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Complex psychiatric diseases, such as chronic psychotic disorder, are major public health issues in the United States. The proposed research provides an innovative framework and develops powerful and computationally efficient statistical methods to integrate active (e.g. survey) and passive (e.g. GPS, text and call log) data streams from mobile sensors for the discovery of behavioral targets of treatment for chronic psychosis. By combining her expertise in biostatistics and causal inference with newly obtained knowledge of psychopathology of psychosis and of advanced machine learning methods, Dr. Valeri will acquire the necessary skill set and maturity to launch an independent research group. !",Statistical methods for the assessment of social engagement in psychosis using digital technologies,9994406,K01MH118477,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Boston', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Feeling', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Surveys', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Schools', 'Recovery', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Selection Bias', 'Series', 'Social Interaction', 'Social Mobility', 'Social support', 'Sociology', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Withdrawal', 'base', 'bipolar patients', 'career', 'data access', 'data streams', 'digital', 'disability', 'early onset', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'member', 'mid-career faculty', 'mobile computing', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'patient population', 'professor', 'psychiatric symptom', 'sensor', 'severe mental illness', 'skills', 'social', 'social engagement', 'software development', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2020,137992,0.05884680670262462
"Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT Project Summary  In some individuals chronic tobacco smoke exposure results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis. Both of these parenchymal changes are irreversible, highlighting the importance of the early identification of their development and progression. Unfortunately, currently available methods for detecting the presence and evolution of these changes have limited sensitivity and specificity for very early disease and for subtle disease progression. Dr. Ash’s work has shown that automated objective analysis of computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest can detect clinically relevant radiologic findings called interstitial changes that may represent early pulmonary fibrosis, even in individuals without visually apparent disease. In the first aim of this proposal, Dr. Ash will refine and utilize a more sensitive and specific automated CT analysis tool that he and his lab have developed for the detection of both emphysema and interstitial changes. He will determine if emphysema and interstitial changes detected using this method are clinically significant in those patients deemed normal by previously performed visual analysis and in those deemed normal by other objective approaches. In the second aim, he will determine if areas of locally high density tissue in visually normal appearing lung parenchyma measured using augmented versions of his objective analysis tools are associated with mortality, other clinical outcomes, and peripheral measures of inflammation. Finally, in the third aim he will utilize these techniques to analyze longitudinal CT scans from the COPDGene study that were obtained over 10 years of follow-up, and will identify factors that predict or modify the development and progression of parenchymal changes on CT.  Dr. Ash will perform this work in the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), a core teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, under the mentorship of Dr. George Washko, an expert in the field of medical image analysis and the co-principal investigator of the Applied Chest Imaging Laboratory at BWH. With the guidance of Dr. Washko and his scientific advisory committee, Dr. Ash has developed a comprehensive five year training program to develop the skills needed to become an independent investigator with expertise in quantitative image analysis, including predictive modeling and statistical machine learning.  Dr. Ash is dedicated to a career in academic medicine. His goal is to become a clinician-scientist using the skills gained during this award to improve our ability to detect and monitor smoking related lung disease. The techniques he has proposed may help identify modifiable risk factors and treatments for smoking related lung disease, determine which patients are likely to benefit from treatment, and monitor the response to therapy. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking results in emphysema and pulmonary fibrosis, but only in a minority of smokers. This proposal aims to use advanced objective analysis of chest computed tomography images to detect the earliest manifestations of smoking related lung disease. This will enable us to identify susceptible patients at the earliest possible moment, track their disease progression, and ultimately shift treatment strategies from palliating disease related symptoms to preventing disease development.",Characterization of Early Response to Chronic Lung Injury using Chest CT,9843731,K08HL145118,"['Advisory Committees', 'Area', 'Award', 'Chest', 'Chronic', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Densitometry', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Educational workshop', 'Evolution', 'Fibrosis', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Predictive Factor', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severity of illness', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Symptoms', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'chest computed tomography', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'exercise capacity', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'interstitial', 'lung injury', 'mange', 'medical schools', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'palliate', 'palliating symptoms', 'palliation', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'protein biomarkers', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'response', 'skills', 'smoking-related lung disease', 'statistical and machine learning', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2020,170320,0.012729973825050983
"Computational Characterization of Environmental Enteropathy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Undernutrition afflicts 20% of children < 5 years of age in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and is a major risk factor for mortality. Linear growth failure (or stunting) in children is tightly linked to irreversible physical and cognitive deficits, with profound implications for development. A common cause of stunting in LMICs is Environmental Enteropathy (EE) which has also been linked to decreased oral vaccine immunogenicity. To date, there are no universally accepted, clear diagnostic algorithms or non-invasive biomarkers for EE making this a critical priority. In this K23 Mentored Career Development Award application, Dr. Sana Syed, a Pediatric Gastroenterologist with advanced training in Nutrition at the University of Virginia, proposes to 1) Develop and validate a Deep Learning Net to identify morphological features of EE versus celiac and healthy small intestinal tissue, 2) correlate the Deep Learning Net identified distinguishing EE intestinal tissue findings with clinical phenotype, measures of gut barrier and absorption, and bile acid deconjugation, and 3) Use a Deep Learning Net computational approach to identify distinguishing multiomic patterns of EE versus celiac disease. This work will be carried out in the context of an ongoing birth cohort study of environmental enteropathy in Pakistan (SEEM). Dr. Syed proposes a career development plan which includes mentorship, fieldwork, coursework, publications, and clinical time that will situate her as an independent physician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing computational `omics and image approaches to elucidate biologic mechanisms of stunting pathways and in identification of novel and effective therapies for EE.

"Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD Project Summary This NHLBI K01 application supports the career development of Dr. Nrupen A. Bhavsar, PhD, an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the Duke University School of Medicine. Dr. Bhavsar is a chronic disease epidemiologist who has performed multidisciplinary studies in the epidemiology of CVD, chronic kidney disease and cancer. He is passionate about pursuing a career in clinical research at the intersection of epidemiology, informatics, and biostatistics. At the end of the award period, Dr. Bhavsar will be an independent investigator applying knowledge gained through this K01 to develop large scale EHR-based population studies that identify individuals at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. Through training in data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference, he will apply missing data methods to conduct rigorous non-randomized studies to improve health. The topical areas of the proposed training and research are diabetes and incident CVD events in the application of data linkage, machine learning, and causal inference. Career development aim: Obtain transdisciplinary competencies within informatics, biostatistics, and population sciences to investigate methodological challenges inherent in the use of multi-health system EHR data for clinical research. The training approach will leverage didactic and experiential training complemented by analyses of data derived from a multi-health system, multi-state research collaborative. Study population: Patients who received care at one of the North Carolina or South Carolina “Carolinas Collaborative” institutions (Duke University Medical Center, UNC-CH Health System, Wake Forest Baptist Health Center, and 9 additional health systems collaborating within the Health Sciences of South Carolina institutions). Specific aims: This proposal will identify approaches to account for missing data when patients seek care across multiple health systems but EHR data is only available from a single health system. Estimating the systemic bias introduced by missing data for single institution studies and identifying methods for accounting for missing data biases may improve the ability of EHR data to be used for clinical research. Anticipated results: Through this NHLBI K01 Research Scientist Career Development Award, Dr. Bhavsar will acquire essential training and research experience to develop large scale EHR-based population studies in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Data from the electronic health records (EHR) are increasingly being used for clinical research, yet there is limited information on the best approaches to address the methodological limitations of the EHR, such as missing data. In patients with diabetes at risk of cardiovascular disease events, I will examine the impact that missing data has on the ability to use the EHR for clinical research and develop approaches to address the biases resulting from missing data.",Addressing Bias from Missing Data in EHR Based Studies of CVD,9994001,K01HL140146,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Award', 'Baptist Church', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Linkages', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Legal', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Sciences', 'Population Study', 'Privacy', 'Publishing', 'Renal carcinoma', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'South Carolina', 'Stroke', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder epidemiology', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'care seeking', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data quality', 'distributed data', 'electronic data', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'forest', 'high risk', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient population', 'population health', 'practical application', 'professor', 'randomized trial', 'skills', 'study population']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,165444,0.05713564037461674
"The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The candidate for this K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award aims to become an international leader in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel health care interventions and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis that is diagnosed in utero but that persists after birth, or postnatally persistent hydronephrosis (PNH). The proposed mentored research and career development plan lays the foundation for this career and the eventual development of a standardized management strategy for PNH by generating the evidence needed to support its development and creating an ultrasound (U/S) grading tool needed to implement it in routine clinical practice. Kidney U/Ss are the main test to monitor PNH, but U/S reports are heterogeneously formatted and contain synonymous and ambiguous terms that complicate their interpretation. Another major obstacle in the field is a need to predict those at risk for worsening disease and to better understand the natural history of PNH. Aim 1 will develop a Natural Language Processing algorithm to automatically translate free-text U/S reports into structured data providing the PNH grade. Aim 2 will use baseline U/S and renal scan data to predict the PNH grade at 2 years. Aim 3 will use growth curves to simulate PNH’s natural history and provide the time and frequency of disease resolution/improvement, stability, and progression. The candidate brings to this proposal experience as a pediatric urological surgeon at a large tertiary care children’s hospital and core research skills in epidemiology and biostatistics. An integral part of his career development will be a continued relationship with an outstanding multidisciplinary mentoring team with complementary strengths. The candidate’s primary mentor is Rachel Hess, MD, MS. Dr. Hess is a world renown expert in implementing interventions in routine clinical care and has an exemplary track record of mentorship. Flory Nkoy, MD, MS, MPH, the candidate’s co-mentor, is an expert in bioinformatics and internationally recognized for developing, disseminating, and implementing pioneering approaches to treat chronic disease in children. Advisors include Jeffrey Ferraro, PhD, and Wendy Chapman, PhD (bioinformatics), Angela Presson, PhD (biostatistics), Patrick Cartwright, MD (pediatric urology), and Mark Ebert, MD (pediatric radiology). The proposed research and training plan will establish the candidate’s solid foundation in bioinformatics, augment his prior epidemiology and biostatistics training, and provide extraordinary training in dissemination and implementation science. This will provide him with the skills and experience necessary for a career as a successful independent researcher focused on developing, implementing, and disseminating novel management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, with an initial focus on hydronephrosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE / RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Hydronephrosis diagnosed in utero but persisting after birth (PNH) affects tens of thousands of infants each year in the United States, but its management is complicated by ambiguous reporting of hydronephrosis severity and a relatively limited understanding of predictors of disease outcome and knowledge of the disease’s natural history. The proposed research uses the largest known pediatric hydronephrosis cohort to develop a tool to translates free-text ultrasound reports into coded PNH grades, predict the 2-year outcome using 3-month baseline data, and apply sophisticated modeling techniques to simulate the disease’s natural history. Taken together, results from this proposal will lead to the development of a standardized management strategy for PNH and facilitate the candidate’s transition to an independent research career in the development, dissemination, and implementation of novel treatment and management strategies for pediatric urologic disease, beginning with pediatric hydronephrosis.",The Utah-Cohort Of Postnatally persistent Antenatal Hydronephrosis (U-COPAH),9892829,K08DK119535,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Caliber', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Care', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Image', 'Infant', 'International', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Manuals', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Natural History', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Radiology', 'Performance', 'Predictive Factor', 'Pregnancy', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Renal function', 'Renal pelvis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Selection Bias', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Urologic Diseases', 'Urologic Surgeon', 'Urology', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'antenatal', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'disease natural history', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'in utero diagnosis', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatrician', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prognostic', 'research and development', 'skills', 'structured data', 'support tools', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'urinary', 'urologic']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K08,2020,168411,0.022042133049573916
"Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity Cortical GABAergic interneurons are critical components of neural circuitry, and their dysfunction has been linked to neurodevelopmental diseases. Although the diversity of interneurons is not disputed, both the extent of their heterogeneity and the gene regulatory mechanisms that drive it remain unclear. Recent advances in single cell RNA-sequencing technology have shed new light on this issue, enabling the prediction of novel interneuron subtypes based on gene expression. Cross-species meta-analysis would provide key insight into conserved mechanisms of interneuron diversity. However, cross-study integration remains a major challenge. I hypothesize that interneuron identity is defined by unifying molecular processes across species. This project is designed to reveal these processes by using an integrative, cross-species approach to explore the transcriptional, epigenetic, and developmental mechanisms that govern interneuron diversity. First, I have shown that mouse interneuron subtypes replicably express genes associated with cell-cell communication, enabling cross-dataset meta-analysis. The goal of Aim 1 is to use improved computational and phylogenetic methods to define homologous interneuron subtypes across species and identify robust gene targets. Second, preliminary investigation of single cell methylome-sequencing data indicates that it can be readily aligned with expression data. In Aim 2 I will use machine learning methods to generate networks from epigenomic and expression data and identify subtype-specific regulatory features. Third, I have shown that transcriptional profiles from developing neurons can be quantitatively assessed with respect to adult expression data. Aim 3 will use meta-analytic aggregation of temporal inference methods to enable cross-dataset comparisons and define conserved developmental gene programs. These studies will reveal a multidimensional portrait of interneuron molecular identity and enable genetic access to these cell types, a key aim of the BRAIN Initiative. I also propose an extensive training plan that will support my transition to independence. CSHL provides an outstanding research environment, with unequaled opportunities for scientific discussion, advanced skills training and career development. I have assembled an exceptional team of collaborators and mentors who will help me to achieve my goals. Dr. Jesse Gillis, expert in transcriptome meta-analysis, and Dr. Josh Huang, expert in GABAergic interneuron identity, will be my mentors. Dr. Bing Ren, Dr. Adam Siepel, Dr. Guoping Feng, Dr. Jessica Tollkuhn and Dr. Michael Greenberg will be collaborators and members of my advisory committee, ensuring that my research will be of the highest caliber. My training will also involve coursework in multiomics data integration and comparative genomics, and I will continue my professional development by presenting at international conferences, mentoring students and attending workshops at CSHL. Together, the proposed studies and professional training will ensure my successful transition to an independent position at a major university where I will lead a lab that will advance the goals of the BRAIN Initiative. Interneurons are key components of neural circuitry, acting as the cellular `brakes' that dampen neuronal activity. Although it has long been known that interneurons come in many different shapes and sizes, both the extent of this diversity and its consequences for brain function remain unclear. In this project, we propose that by combining information about the gene activity and epigenetic landscapes of interneurons across multiple species we will generate an integrated, multi-layered portrait of interneuron diversity which we can use to understand brain",Revealing the transcriptional and developmental mechanisms of interneuron identity,9898481,K99MH120050,"['Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bar Codes', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Maintenance', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Gene', 'Developmental Process', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Lateral Geniculate Body', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Portraits', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'career development', 'cell type', 'comparative genomics', 'data integration', 'design', 'developmental neurobiology', 'differential expression', 'epigenomics', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'methylome', 'mouse genetics', 'neural circuit', 'neuroinformatics', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills training', 'student mentoring', 'symposium', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,K99,2020,118421,0.013626247562566064
"The fitness effects of de novo structural variants PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposal for the NIH Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) focuses on the training of Dr. PingHsun Hsieh to become an independent investigator of large-scale genomics and human population genetics. Dr. Hsieh is a population geneticist by training, and the proposed studies will advance his training into long-read- based sequencing technologies and novel machine-learning approaches to study the fitness consequences of new mutations, with a focus on structural variants (SVs), in humans and nonhuman primates. Another essential piece will be the development of resources on which types of new SVs are most likely to be pathogenic and hence most worth further effort by medical researchers. The methods developed in this work will enable other researchers to do more hypothesis-free analysis of SVs in disease etiology. Specifically, the training program will center on the study of the distribution of fitness effects of new SVs in human and nonhuman primates using high-quality SV calls and genotypes from several large-scale long- and short-read sequencing projects. The mentored work will take place under the supervision of the primary mentor, Dr. Evan Eichler, and the co-mentor, Dr. Sharon Browning, both at the University of Washington (UW). The mentor and co-mentor are well-established experts in the characterization of genomic variations using high-throughput technologies and the development of stochastic modeling methods for large-scale genetic data, respectively. Dr. Hsieh will also gain advice from a formal advisory committee as well as through activities arranged by the Department of Genome Sciences (GS), which is an optimal place for the mentored training providing the candidate with access to outstanding scientists in areas including genetics of model organisms, disease, population genetics, and the development of high-throughput genomic technologies. While found in nature and yet generally deemed to be deleterious given their size, SVs can be beneficial, and thus, the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new SVs (i.e., the relative frequencies of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious SVs) remains elusive. In the proposed studies, we will infer the DFE of new SVs and other variants to assess their relative importance in nature, which in turn helps prioritize variants (e.g., SVs vs. single- nucleotide variants [SNVs]) in medical genetics. Specifically, in the K99/R00 phases we will (1) infer the DFE of new SVs and SNVs using a diverse panel of ~100 long-read and ~4,000 short-read high-coverage human and nonhuman primate genomes; (2) compare the DFE of new mutations among primates using contemporary and ancient DNA genomes; and (3) study the fitness effects and selective constraints on diseases in different mutation categories in large cohorts of >20,000 genomes. The skills learned in this proposal are on the cutting-edge and are tailored for the candidate to amass a great amount of knowledge in new areas of genomics, which will be applicable to many organisms and diseases and critical to the candidate’s future independent laboratory. NARRATIVE Understanding the relative abundance of beneficial, neutral, and deleterious mutations in different variant categories (e.g., genic vs. intergenic) provides useful guidance and resources for biomedical researchers to prioritize disease-causing mutations and strategize their efforts. To date, however, little effort has been made to study the full spectrum of fitness effects of new structural variants – an important but largely underappreciated genomic variation. The work proposed here seeks to leverage long-read sequencing technologies and develop novel machine-learning approaches to quantify the fitness effects of new mutation, with a focus on structural variants, and subsequently delineate the relative importance among different types of mutations in genetic diseases.",The fitness effects of de novo structural variants,9950314,K99HG011041,"['Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Award', 'Base Pairing', 'Benchmarking', 'Categories', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Demography', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Drift', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mutation', 'Natural Selections', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phase', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Primates', 'Public Health', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'biological systems', 'biomedical resource', 'career', 'cohort', 'disease-causing mutation', 'expectation', 'fitness', 'genome sciences', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic locus', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput technology', 'human population genetics', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'pressure', 'simulation', 'skills', 'technology development', 'trait']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,132244,0.005527963815559174
"Associating retinal nerve fiber layer thickness with glucose metabolism and diabetic retinopathy Project Summary/Abstract Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a metabolic disease that affects over 300 million people worldwide and that can be accompanied by serious health complications such as heart disease, kidney failure, stroke, and damage to the eyes, in particular diabetic retinopathy (DR), which is diagnosed in a third of people with diabetes and which is the leading cause of blindness within the age group between 20 and 64 years. T2DM is clinically diagnosed by parameters related to glucose metabolism obtained by blood tests. Due to its long pre- symptomatic phase, an estimate of 25% of diabetics in the US are undiagnosed. In this project, the relationship between spatial patterns of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness (RNFLT), measured by spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), and blood test levels as well as levels of DR severity is investigated in 9,261 participants of a population based study.  In a first step, OCT RNFLT measurements of the macular and the circumpapillary area around optic nerve head are segmented into spatial sectors, and representative spatial patterns of RNFLT are calculated by an unsupervised machine learning method. Afterwards, a multivariate linear model comparison is performed with the coefficients of the spatial RNFLT patterns as regressors and diagnostic blood test results as dependent variable. The optimal combination of the RNFLT patterns, determined by an established model selection criterion (Bayes Factor), is expected to reveal insight into the association between the specific retinal locations of RNFL thinning accompanying the change in parameters related glucose metabolism during the development and progression of T2DM. Furthermore, fundus images are graded by DR severity following a nine-step scale derived from the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study from no DR to severe proliferative DR. The spatial RNFLT patterns and metabolic blood test scores are then compared with respect to modeling DR severity by linear regression. An optimal model of DR severity combining glucose metabolism parameters and RNFLT patterns is developed. Finally, in an analogous procedure, DR severity of the follow-up measurement, five years after baseline, is statistically predicted from RNFLT and metabolic blood parameters and from their change over time.  To summarize, the proposed research identifies spatial patterns of RNFLT associated with parameters of glucose metabolism and their development over DR severity. Once accomplished, the proposed project would provide the details to establish RNFLT as an alternative manifestation of T2DM that complements diagnostic blood tests and thereby, for instance, lay the foundations for the development of novel and more accurate T2DM progression monitoring or the prediction of the onset of DR. Project Narrative Parameters related to glucose metabolism obtained by blood tests are clinically used to diagnose diabetes, a metabolic disease that affects over 300 million people worldwide and that can be accompanied by serious health complications, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), the leading cause of blindness within the age group between 20 and 64 years. Decreased levels of blood glucose tolerance have been associated with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning, but these results were based on comparisons between small populations of diagnosed diabetics and healthy controls, and RNFL was typically represented by coarse summary parameters which neglect retinal anatomy. This project contributes directly and immediately to public health by exploring the relationship between spatial patterns of RNFL thickness, present and future DR severity, and diagnostic blood test results in 9,261 participants of a population based study, with the final goal to establish and quantify RNFL thickness as an alternative manifestation of diabetes that complements diagnostic blood tests and lays the foundations for the development of novel and more accurate disease progression monitoring or the prediction of DR onset.",Associating retinal nerve fiber layer thickness with glucose metabolism and diabetic retinopathy,10002287,R21EY030631,"['Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Blindness', 'Blood', 'Blood Glucose', 'Blood Tests', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Linear Models', 'Linear Regressions', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'OGTT', 'Optic Disk', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Scanning', 'Selection Criteria', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Validation', 'age group', 'archetypal analysis', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'diabetic', 'fasting plasma glucose', 'follow-up', 'fundus imaging', 'glucose metabolism', 'glucose tolerance', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'macula', 'neglect', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'public health relevance', 'retinal nerve fiber layer', 'unsupervised learning']",NEI,SCHEPENS EYE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R21,2020,240285,0.07252956874945907

His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in imaging phenotyping, genomics, and predictive analytics of the regional heterogeneity of the various aspects of COPD (emphysema, airway disease, and pulmonary vascular remodeling). Environment: Dr. El Boueiz will continue to pursue his research and career development in the rich and multidisciplinary environment of the CDNM and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Applied Chest Imaging Lab (ACIL). He will be mentored by Drs. Edwin K. Silverman, Peter J. Castaldi, and Raúl San José Estépar, leaders in the field of COPD quantitative imaging, genetic epidemiology, and predictive analytics with excellent track records of mentoring young investigators towards independent research careers. His career development will also be overseen by an advisory committee with expertise related to key areas of his proposal. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. COPD is a heterogeneous disease and this heterogeneity complicates the identification of the predictors of disease progression and consequently, the development of effective therapies. Emphysema distribution is an important COPD-related phenotype that emerged as a strong predictor of the response to lung volume reduction procedures. Despite the availability of advanced texture-based CT quantification methods, global threshold-based quantitative metrics have to date been the cornerstone for the radiological characterization of emphysema distribution with inability to differentiate centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema patterns. In this project, we will apply a texture-based CT quantification method to discover novel imaging biomarkers of the regional heterogeneity of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema in a large cohort of well-characterized smokers and identify their genetic determinants using whole genome sequencing and integrative genomics analyses. The results will be considered for inclusion along with other rich phenotypic and imaging data in COPD disease progression machine learning predictive models. Relevance: Through improved radiographic phenotyping of emphysema distribution, better understanding of disease pathobiology, and more accurate prediction of disease progression, the proposed work will open new avenues of investigation for the development of personalized and improved COPD therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that affects up to 24 million people in the United States, is associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality, and for which there is no available disease-modifying therapy. COPD is associated with significant variation in radiographic, symptomatic and physiologic presentation and exhibits variability in progression. Currently, there is no satisfactory method for progression prediction. This project will identify novel imaging biomarkers of the regional distribution of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema with particular emphasis on their associations with clinical relevant COPD-related outcomes, their genetic determinants, and their ability to improve prediction of COPD disease progression, above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. This is an important area of research as predicting those patients who will remain stable from those who will have rapid disease progression is critical in defining prognosis and selecting patients for specific therapeutic interventions.","Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers",9975215,K08HL141601,"['ACVR1B gene', 'Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Airway Disease', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Volume Reductions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Respiratory physiology', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2020,170639,0.01758224007147512
"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing. If successful, this project will reduce the cardiac testing burden and facilitate activation for transplant for patients on the kidney transplant waitlist.",Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates,9871208,K23DK123410,"['Accreditation', 'Age', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Effectiveness', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Information Systems', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical Performance', 'Population', 'Process', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Science', 'Specificity', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Wait Time', 'Waiting Lists', 'Walking', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'fitness', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'older patient', 'patient oriented research', 'patient subsets', 'personalized strategies', 'predictive test', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relative effectiveness', 'response', 'screening', 'skills']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,166536,0.028233503917624584
"Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury Project Summary/Abstract Dr. Zafar is a neurointensivist and clinical neurophysiologist at the Massachusetts General Hospital, whose goal is to become an independent investigator with expertise in comparative effectiveness research and pragmatic clinical trials using neurophysiologic tools, to improve outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries and seizures. Epileptiform abnormalities (seizures and seizure-like rhythmic patterns) are seen on electroencephalography (EEG) in up to 40% of acute brain injury patients and are associated with worse outcomes. Due to lack of evidence-based guidance, patients with epileptiform abnormalities are often aggressively treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs), exposing them to AED related adverse effects that may worsen outcomes. Dr. Zafar's preliminary data shows that increasing burden of epileptiform abnormalities in patients with hemorrhagic stroke is associated with worse outcomes. Up to half these patients receive AED treatment with no improvement in outcomes, and AED use itself is independently associated with worse outcomes. Dr. Zafar has built a comprehensive EEG database of 2000 patients to investigate AED effectiveness. In her career development plan, she will be using the rich neurophysiologic data in the EEG database, along with a nationwide dataset (Premier Healthcare Database) to study AED and EEG utilization patterns and AED effectiveness in a “real-clinical world” setting. Under the mentorship of Dr. M. Bradon Westover, and co-mentors (Dr. John Hsu, Dr. Elisabetta Patorno, and Dr. Hang Lee), Dr. Zafar proposes to: 1) Determine which specific epileptiform abnormalities show an acute response to AEDs by assessing neurological improvement within 24 hours of treatment (EEG database), 2) Assess the impact of AEDs on in- hospital clinical adverse outcomes and discharge functional outcomes in acute brain injury patients with epileptiform abnormalities (EEG database), 3) Investigate how AED-related adverse outcomes vary with practice patterns across hospitals with different resources and EEG utilization patterns (Premier Database). Dr. Zafar will perform a systematic exploration of the EEG database to determine EEG phenotypes associated with response to AED treatment, and determine the impact of AEDs on in-hospital adverse outcomes (e.g. mortality, hepatotoxicity, cardiac events). To account for national variation in AED prescription, hospital resources and EEG use, Dr. Zafar will examine adverse outcomes in the Premier Database. In addition to the proposed research, Dr. Zafar's career development plan includes a Masters of Science and coursework on analysis of large databases, pharmacoepidemiology and machine learning. Dr. Zafar will receive guidance from her mentors and advisors with diverse clinical and scientific expertise. The proposed training will allow Dr. Zafar to establish a niche in using neurophysiologic data in comparative effectiveness research and launch an independent research career aimed at improving neurologic outcomes in patients with acute brain injuries. Project Narrative Although patients admitted with brain injuries such as stroke and traumatic brain injury are at high risk for developing seizures, physicians have very limited information to guide anti-epileptic drug management in such patients. This results in frequent overuse of anti-epileptic mediations that are also known to have harmful side effects. Dr. Zafar's proposed project will significantly advance our knowledge on which patients benefit the most from treatment and which patients are at highest risk for harmful side effects, providing guidance for physicians in making treatment decisions that will improve outcomes in the thousands of brain injury patients admitted to US hospitals each year.",Optimizing anti-epileptic drug treatment in acute brain injury,10019612,K23NS114201,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Antiepileptic Agents', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Hospitals', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Massachusetts', 'Master of Science', 'Mediation', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological Models', 'Neurological outcome', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Pragmatic clinical trial', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rural', 'Safety', 'Seizures', 'Severity of illness', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Variant', 'active comparator', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'disorder subtype', 'evidence base', 'functional outcomes', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'neurophysiology', 'patient subsets', 'phenotypic data', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'side effect', 'skills', 'stroke patient', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2020,200880,0.0606496365684182
"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics. The research proposed will apply novel strategies to further develop integrative machine learning analyses of multidimensional genomic data, discover clinically relevant predictive models, and create computational tools to accelerate future research.",Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models,9936223,R00HG009678,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Advisory Committees', 'Award', 'Bioconductor', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Budgets', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Coupling', 'CpG Island Methylator Phenotype', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'Yang', 'biomarker performance', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data framework', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'data standards', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein metabolite', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'tenure track', 'tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R00,2020,249000,0.057946315449164655
"EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy Project Summary Dr. Jennifer A. Kim is a critical care neurologist and neuroscientist at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded translational investigator with expertise in signal processing of neurophysiologic and neuroimaging data to identify early biomarkers of secondary brain injury in critically ill patients, particularly related to post-traumatic epilepsy. Post-traumatic epilepsy is a disabling complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is an urgent need to find biomarkers of post-traumatic epilepsy to identify patients at high risk for developing this complication. It is a population in which early biomarker identification could improve patient monitoring and ultimately treatment development to circumvent epileptogenesis. Post- traumatic epilepsy contributes to worsening of the already high rates of TBI morbidity, disability and cost of care, thus emphasizing the importance of preventing this complication. We need to find biomarkers to best define those most likely to benefit from potential treatments and make such treatment discovery trials more feasible. During the proposed training period, the candidate will expand upon her knowledge of EEG signal processing and machine learning techniques and acquire new skills in neuroimaging analysis using Magnetic Resonance technologies and biostatistics. To accomplish this, Dr. Kim has brought together a strong mentorship team of Dr. Hal Blumenfeld (primary mentor) and co-mentors Drs. Todd Constable, Brandon Westover and Brian Edlow who have expertise in multi-modal approaches to studying epilepsy, functional MRI analysis, computational EEG analysis and structural TBI imaging, respectively. Under their mentorship, Dr. Kim proposes to: 1) quantify epileptiform abnormality (EA) frequency and identify EA waveform features that optimally predict PTE, 2) determine if direct hippocampal injury, assessed by cortical thickness and contusion volume, stratifies PTE risk 3) assess whether indirect hippocampal injury, based on structural and functional MRI connectivity analyses, portend PTE. The overall goal is to identify early biomarkers of patients at high risk for post-traumatic epilepsy to target development of anti-epileptogenesis treatments. Bringing together advanced neurophysiologic and neuroimaging analysis and this strong mentorship support, this project opens new avenues for optimizing follow-up care and advancing potential treatment development for all traumatic brain injury patients at risk for post-traumatic epilepsy. This well-defined patient-oriented research proposal, in concert with the mentorship and structured didactic curriculum, will provide Dr. Kim with the skills that are essential to develop an independent career in neurophysiological and neuroimaging research that translates to improving patient outcomes. Project Narrative Post-traumatic epilepsy, a seizure disorder secondary to traumatic brain injury (TBI), is among the most disabling and difficult-to-treat complications of TBI. Currently, there are no tools to identify patients a priori at highest risk for PTE. Dr. Kim's proposed career development plan has great potential to advance our knowledge of the acute biomarkers of PTE using EEG and MRI, to improve early identification and ultimately provide treatment options for this potentially preventable complication.",EEG and MRI Biomarkers to Predict Post-traumatic Epilepsy,10055272,K23NS112596,"['Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Antiepileptogenic', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blinded', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Complication', 'Contusions', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Electroencephalography', 'Enrollment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epileptogenesis', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Epilepsy', 'Prevention trial', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Rodent Model', 'Sclerosis', 'Secondary to', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'axon injury', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker identification', 'care costs', 'career', 'career development', 'cost estimate', 'didactic education', 'disability', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'human imaging', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'patient biomarkers', 'patient oriented research', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'preventable epilepsy', 'prospective', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NINDS,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,192780,0.0461981937450833
"Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling PROJECT SUMMARY Candidate: Dr. Strom received an MD from Harvard Medical School (HMS), and has completed clinical training in internal medicine (MGH), cardiology (BIDMC), and non-invasive cardiac imaging (BIDMC). Additionally, he completed an MSc in Epidemiology program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in May, 2018. He is now a junior faculty member at BIDMC with 75% protected time to conduct clinical research. Through this proposed 5-year program, Dr. Strom will pursue additional training in advanced prediction modeling, machine learning, patient-oriented research, and metabolomics. The candidate’s long- term goal is to become an R01-funded investigator in the area of applied outcomes research. Environment: The candidate will be mentored by Robert W. Yeh (Primary Mentor), Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Director of the Smith Center for Outcomes Research in Cardiology, Robert E. Gerszten (Co-Mentor), Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Cardiovascular Medicine at BIDMC, and Changyu Shen (Co-Mentor), upcoming Associate Professor of Medicine at HMS and Lead Biostatistician for the Smith Center. Dr. Yeh has a track record of leading practice-changing studies and successful mentorship of clinician investigators. Dr. Gerszten is an internationally recognized expert in molecular phenotyping of cardiovascular diseases using metabolomics and proteomics and has mentored several K-award and R01 funded clinical investigators. Dr. Shen has a long track record of NIH funding, expertise in evaluating heterogeneity of treatment effect in cardiovascular diseases, and has mentored multiple prior trainees. Research: The optimal therapy for a given individual with aortic stenosis remains uncertain. This proposal seeks to define the clinical and biologic components of frailty that modify risk after aortic valve replacement (AVR) and alter treatment benefit. For Aims 1-2, we will leverage the unique linkage of Medicare data to the US CoreValve Pivotal trials, a collection of clinical trials that randomized individuals with severe aortic stenosis to transcatheter AVR (TAVR) with a self-expanding bioprosthesis vs. surgical AVR (SAVR). In Aim 1, we will we will identify which variables, related to in-person assessments of frailty and candidate frailty codes, best predict adverse outcomes after AVR. In Aim 2, we will identify if novel variables identified in Aim 1, identify a heterogeneous treatment response in individuals undergoing AVR. In Aim 3, we will prospectively enroll patients undergoing TAVR at BIDMC with concurrent frailty phenotyping to identify whether metabolites associated with longevity correlate with frailty and predict adverse outcomes, independent of age and comorbidities. The research will identify the mechanisms by which frailty confers adverse risk and differential treatment benefit in AVR, providing insights that may personalize treatment selection and improve patient care. PROJECT NARRATIVE While new technologies have permitted the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis, which is fatal without treatment, deciding on the optimal treatment for a given patient is often difficult, especially as these decisions are often made towards the end of life and there are significant risks concomitant with each treatment. In this setting, frailty, a state of debility that impairs recovery from illness, has emerged as a significant risk factor for adverse outcomes but the mechanisms by which frailty confers risk and the components of frailty that are most important are unknown. In this proposal, we seek to define the clinical and biological components of frailty that contribute risk in aortic valve replacement using a combination of novel data sources and methodologic techniques, including linkage of clinical trials to administrative data, machine learning, and metabolite profiling, in order to personalize treatments and optimize patient health and medical decision making.",Identification of the Components of Frailty Using Administrative Data and Metabolite Profiling,9969556,K23HL144907,"['Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Bioprosthesis device', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronology', 'Citric Acid Cycle', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Faculty', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Internal Medicine', 'International', 'Israel', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Physician Executives', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Provider', 'Public Health Schools', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'aortic valve replacement', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'end of life', 'frailty', 'health data', 'health service use', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'member', 'metabolomics', 'mid-career faculty', 'minimally invasive', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'optimal treatments', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'surgical risk', 'treatment effect', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2020,172800,0.055763765892714444
"Generalizable biomedical informatics strategies for predictive modeling of treatment response Identification of patients with poor and favorable treatment response prior to therapy administration is invaluable for improving patient survival and disease management. We propose to build an open-source scalable generalizable method that would assist experimentalists and clinicians on assessing patient's risk of developing therapy resistance and would establish a foundation for our long-term goal to build a platform for patient-centric clinical decision making, personalized therapeutic advice, and disease management.  We propose to develop a generalizable versatile bioinformatics paradigm that will use patient molecular profiles to PREDICT their Therapy Response, PREDICTTR, which combines network analysis, statistical modeling, and ensemble machine learning in a unique innovative way that allows accurate elucidation of complex multi-level relationships that govern treatment response. The objective of our proposed approach is two-fold: (i) uncover molecular markers and valuable candidates for therapeutic intervention, which can potentially be targeted to preclude or overcome resistance; and (ii) predict patient's response to therapy administration, which holds a long-term promise to improve disease outcome and reduce the cost of unnecessary and ineffective treatments.  Motivated by increasing cases of treatment resistance in oncology, we will apply our algorithm to elucidate (i) response to androgen targeting in prostate cancer and (ii) response to standard-of-care chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia. We will disseminate our approach through a web-based decision- making tool, which will be implemented through a Hadoop-oriented solution to (i) broaden its practical impact and (ii) establish clinical utility. Taken together, this multi-task resource is a unique innovative effort of its kind in the therapeutic resistance space with a direct broad impact on personalized therapeutic advice and disease management. Even though we will train our model in prostate cancer and acute myeloid leukemia, our approach can be easily and broadly applicable to other therapies and diseases.  This effort will be led by an Early Stage Investigator, Antonina Mitrofanova (PI) who has extensive training and expertise in biomedical informatics and big data analytics. Her collaborative team includes Dr. Shantenu Jha (Rutgers, co-I) who is an expert in distributed systems and will advise on Hadoop development and validation; Dr. Shridar Ganesan (Rutgers, co-I) who will provide clinical and sequencing patient data and incorporate the utilization of our method into the Rutgers CINJ Molecular Tumor Board; Dr. Isaac Kim (Rutgers, co-I) who will provide additional data for validation in prostate cancer; Dr. Christopher Hourigan (NHLBI , NIH, Significant Collaborator), who will provide data for clinical validation in acute myeloid leukemia and is committed to test our web-based portal; and Dr. Scott Parrott (Rutgers, co-I), who is an expert in statistical analysis and will consult on power calculations and multiple testing corrections. PROJECT NARRATIVE Identification of patients with poor and favorable treatment response prior to therapy administration is invaluable for improving patient survival and disease management. This proposal is dedicated to developing novel biomedical informatics paradigm to uncover genomic and transcriptomic mechanisms of therapeutic resistance and predict patients at risk of treatment failure, which will be shared with a wide scientific community through an open-source web-based portal. We utilize resistance to androgen-deprivation and second- generation anti-androgens in prostate cancer and resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia as our training examples, yet our paradigm can be broadly generalizable to study resistance to various therapeutic regimens and across different diseases.",Generalizable biomedical informatics strategies for predictive modeling of treatment response,10117702,R01LM013236,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Androgen Antagonists', 'Androgens', 'Atlases', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cancer Institute of New Jersey', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Outcome', 'Distributed Systems', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Oncology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prostate Adenocarcinoma', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Regimen', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Translations', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor stage', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'androgen deprivation therapy', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cancer genome', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical sequencing', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'design', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'ineffective therapies', 'innovation', 'molecular marker', 'multitask', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'personalized therapeutic', 'predictive modeling', 'profiles in patients', 'response', 'standard of care', 'statistical learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapy development', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'unnecessary treatment', 'web portal']",NLM,RBHS-SCHOOL/ HEALTH RELATED PROFESSIONS,R01,2020,323986,0.0022293751847711238
"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT This is an application for a K23 award for Dr. Carolyn Hendrickson, a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Hendrickson is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient-oriented research of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a focus on the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after traumatic brain injury (TBI). This K23 award will provide Dr. Hendrickson with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert clinical and translational researcher in ARDS after traumatic injury; (2) to study the biologic mechanisms of ARDS after TBI involving platelet biology, endothelial activation, and lung injury induced by mechanical ventilation; (3) to implement advanced analyses of complex observational data, including machine learning; (4) to develop an independent translational research career. Dr. Hendrickson's plan to achieve these goals is supported by a multidisciplinary mentoring team of experts. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Matthay, has extensive experience in translational ARDS research and in the career development of early stage investigators. Dr. Hendrickson will work with four co-mentors: Dr. Mitchell Cohen, a translational researcher studying coagulation after trauma, Dr. Alan Hubbard, a biostatistician specializing in causal inference, Dr. Geoffrey Manley, a neurosurgeon and leading investigator in TBI research, and Dr. Mark Looney, an expert platelet biology and lung injury. The development of ARDS after TBI is common and is associated with worse neurological outcomes. The biologic mechanisms driving ARDS after TBI are poorly understood. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the risk of ARDS after TBI is mediated through activated vascular endothelium and platelets as well as non-protective mechanical ventilation strategies that use large tidal volumes. Dr. Hendrickson will investigate these causal pathways utilizing previously collected data and plasma from an ongoing observational cohort study. In this same cohort she will prospectively collect biospecimens, detailed mechanical ventilation data, and lung ultrasound images. This proposal represents an innovative approach to studying ARDS after TBI using carefully adjudicated exposures and outcomes. Dr. Hendrickson will test whether plasma biomarkers of endothelial activation, vascular permeability, and inflammation (Aim 1) and platelet function, activation, and aggregation (Aim 2) are associated with ARDS after TBI. She will collect lung ultrasound images and frequent mechanical ventilation data including tidal volumes and plateau pressures. She will test whether early exposure to non-protective mechanical ventilation is associated with ARDS after TBI (Aim 3). Addressing this gap in knowledge may lead to interventions that prevent ARDS and improve outcomes in this patient population. The research and training outlined in this proposal will form the basis for an R01-level proposal designed to study interventions to prevent and treat ARDS after traumatic injury. Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because each year in the United States 1.7 million people sustain a Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and over 20% of patients with severe isolated TBI develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), a form of serious lung disease associated with poor neurological outcomes after TBI. Identification of biologic factors and mechanical ventilation parameters that contribute to ARDS pathogenesis after TBI is the first step in a continuum of research that will pave the way to prevention, personalized risk assessment, improved early management, and targeted treatments for ARDS in patients with TBI. Additionally, understanding the mechanisms of disease in this vulnerable population will expand the understanding of lung injury pathogenesis after a variety of traumatic injuries and perhaps in other high-risk populations.","Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome after Isolated Traumatic Brain Injury: Platelet Biology, Endothelial Activation, and Mechanical Ventilation",9983146,K23HL133495,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Angiopoietin-2', 'Animals', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Factors', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'Blood Flow Cytometry', 'Blood Platelets', 'Body Weight', 'California', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Disease', 'Endothelium', 'Enrollment', 'Exposure to', 'Functional disorder', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-8', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leukocytes', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mediating', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Platelet Activation', 'Play', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Supportive care', 'TBI Patients', 'TIMP3 gene', 'Testing', 'Thrombelastography', 'Thromboxane B2', 'Tidal Volume', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Ventilator-induced lung injury', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'blood-brain barrier disruption', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'electric impedance', 'experience', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'lung injury', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'platelet function', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'stem', 'training opportunity', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2020,198907,0.06273172323864432
"Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy Abstract  In this project, we present EyeMark, a system with advanced longitudinal image anal- ysis tools for automated computation of biomarkers for diabetic retinopathy (DR) using retinal fundus images. Specifically, we have developed tools for computation of microan- eurysm (MA) appearance and disappearance rates (jointly known as turnover rates) for use as a biomarker in quantifying DR progression risk along with longitudinal analysis of other DR lesions. The availability of a reliable image-based biomarker will have high pos- itive influence on various aspects of DR care, including screening, monitoring progres- sion, drug discovery and clinical research.  Measuring MA turnover and longitudinal analysis of DR lesions involves two labor in- tensive steps: careful alignment of current and baseline images, and marking of individual lesions. This process is very time consuming and prone to error, if done entirely by human graders. The primary goal of this project is to overcome these limitations by automating both the steps involved in longitudinal analysis: accurate image registration, and lesion identification.  We have designed and developed a prototype tool that robustly registers longitudinal images (even with multiple lesion changes) and effectively detects and localizes DR le- sions. This fully automated tool can work on the cloud to produces results in near constant time (for large datasets), and also provide intuitive visualization tools for clinicians to more effectively monitor DR progression. This commercialization readiness pilot (CRP) project is intended to develop a regulatory strategy and a market access plan for EyeMark to enable its introduction in the US market and foster commercial success. Narrative The proposed tool, EyeMark, will greatly enhance the clinical care available to diabetic retinopathy (DR) patients by providing an automated tool for computation of an image- based, reliable, DR biomarker in a non-invasive manner. This will enable identification of patients who are at higher risk to progress to severe retinopathy, thus helping prevent vision loss in such patients by timely intervention. Early identification is especially important in face of long backlog of diabetic patients waiting for an eye examination, and the fact that 90% of vision loss can be saved by early identification. The availability of an effective biomarker will also positively influence the drug discovery process by facilitating early and reliable determination of biological efficacy of potential new therapies.",Automated image-based biomarker computation tools for diabetic retinopathy,10082344,SB1TR000377,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Appearance', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exudate', 'Eye', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Fundus', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Services', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Legal', 'Lesion', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Market Research', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Microaneurysm', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optometry', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Price', 'Process', 'Prothrombin', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Sales', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computerized', 'computerized tools', 'convolutional neural network', 'design', 'diabetic patient', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'fundus imaging', 'health economics', 'high risk', 'high throughput analysis', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'longitudinal analysis', 'medical schools', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'payment', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'sound', 'success', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,"EYENUK, INC.",SB1,2020,300000,0.05656647339390102
"Role of visceral adipose tissue in frailty among patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In this application for a 5-year K23 Career Development Award, I propose mentored research and career development leading to a career as an independent clinical and translational investigator in interstitial lung disease (ILD). The goal of this project is to identify the role of body composition in frailty among subjects with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). The prevalence of IPF is rising, currently affecting 1 in 200 older adults. There is no cure for IPF. The only available medications slow disease progression but do not reverse disease. Frailty affects up to 50% of IPF patients, and is characterized by decreased physiologic reserve and increased susceptibility to severe manifestations of acute insults. The most common causes of death in IPF are acute insults. Frailty is thus a potentially modifiable risk factor for morbidity and mortality in IPF. This proposal builds on my preliminary work showing that (1) greater visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with increased frailty, (2) subjects with both sarcopenia and visceral obesity are at greater risk of frailty than those with sarcopenia alone, (3) there may be distinct endotypes of exercise limitation defined by high inflammation alone or low inflammation with high VAT, and (4) down-regulation of the growth hormone (GH) axis may link VAT and frailty. Under the mentorship of Dr. R Graham Barr, I propose to evaluate the roles of body composition by bioelectrical impedance assay (co-mentor Gallagher), inflammation, and neuroendocrine dysregulation associated with frailty risk using a machine-learning approach (co-mentor Valeri). I will also evaluate the role of growth hormone axis dysregulation in sarcopenia with visceral obesity in a rigorous overnight protocol (co-mentor Freda). I propose to perform this in two NHLBI-funded prospective cohorts: Dr. Garcia’s Families-At-Risk for ILD (R01HL103676) and Dr. Singer’s Advanced Lung Disease Lung Transplantation Study (R01HL134851). With guidance from my mentors, I have crafted a 5-year career development plan that includes training in body composition analysis (Dr. Gallagher), measurement of complex endocrine systems (Dr. Freda), clinical trials (Dr. Freda), biostatistics (Dr. Valeri), aging in interstitial lung disease (Dr. Garcia), and epidemiology (Dr. Barr). In the last two years of this award, I will apply for R01 funding and transition to independence. The proposed activities will prepare me to conduct patient-oriented research to evaluate the role of body composition in outcomes in ILD. I will also acquire the skills and training required to design and conduct clinical trials targeting novel pathways to prevent and treat frailty in ILD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an increasingly prevalent chronic lung disease with no available cure; frailty affects 50% of IPF patients, and is associated with increased severity of illness in response to acute insults, which are the most common cause of death in IPF. We identified that visceral adipose tissue is a risk factor for frailty and propose to investigate potential mechanisms linking visceral adipose tissue and frailty, as modifiable risk factors for morbidity and mortality in this growing patient population. Our findings may lead to novel therapies and clinical trials evaluating the role of existing medications in the prevention and treatment of frailty in IPF.",Role of visceral adipose tissue in frailty among patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis,10055250,K23HL150280,"['Acute', 'Adipose tissue', 'Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'American', 'Arrhythmia', 'Award', 'Biolectric Impedance', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Body Composition', 'Body mass index', 'Cause of Death', 'Central obesity', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Elderly', 'Endocrine system', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'FDA approved', 'Family', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'High Prevalence', 'Hormone secretion', 'Hospitalization', 'Inflammation', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Interleukin-1 Receptors', 'Interleukin-1 beta', 'Interleukin-6', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Pneumonia', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Research', 'Research Priority', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Societies', 'Somatotropin', 'Somatotropin-Releasing Hormone', 'Steroids', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Testosterone', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapy Clinical Trials', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'Variant', 'Visceral', 'Work', 'androgenic', 'career', 'career development', 'circulating biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'frailty', 'growth hormone deficiency', 'health related quality of life', 'hormone analog', 'human old age (65+)', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'pulmonary rehabilitation', 'reduced muscle mass', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'sarcopenic obesity', 'skills training', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'translational approach', 'translational scientist']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K23,2020,170856,0.0466686098841319
"Skeletal Myopathy in Systemic Sclerosis: Devising a Classification Schema Predictive of Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Skeletal myopathy in systemic sclerosis (SSc) is associated with increased disability and mortality. There is no consensus classification of SSc-associated myopathy that can be utilized to lay the groundwork for understanding muscle disease in scleroderma. We know that there is pathological, serological, and outcome heterogeneity that may be informative in defining distinct subsets of myopathy in SSc. Our preliminary data demonstrate that (1) muscle histopathology is heterogeneous in SSc, (2) patients with a fibrosing myopathy have poor outcomes, in particular cardiac death, and (3) there is intense signal uptake on advanced MRI imaging such as diffusion weighted and tensor imaging and T2 mapping in SSc-associated myopathy which may indicate early disease related changes when compared to conventional muscle MRI. This K23 proposal will first establish a Myopathy cohort (Aim 1), devise a classification schema and test its utility in predicting long term outcomes such as trajectory, cardiopulmonary disease, disability, mortality, and treatment responsiveness(Aim 2), and detect and quantify early disease related muscle changes on advanced muscle MRI (Aim 3). This application is for a K23 award for Julie Paik, MD, MHS, Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of Rheumatology at the Johns Hopkins University. Her long term career goal is to become a leading clinical investigator in scleroderma muscle disease in the context of observational cohort studies, state of the art imaging biomarkers, and clinical trial methodology. Her short term goal of devising this classification schema will provide a new gold standard for the validation of external myopathy cohorts in SSc and lay the framework for future studies directed at understanding biological mechanism and developing a therapeutic trial using measurable outcomes such as quantitative muscle MRI. This proposal takes advantage of the rich resources and infrastructure at the Johns Hopkins Scleroderma Center, a recently designated Precision Center of Excellence in 2018. Her mentoring team includes Dr. Laura Hummers and Dr. Fredrick Wigley, both renowned experts in SSc and clinical epidemiology, Dr. Andrew Mammen is an internationally recognized myositis expert, and Dr. Scott Zeger a leader in bio statistical and epidemiological research. Dr. Paik has recruited vital members to her Advisory Committee, composed of mentors and collaborators who have specific expertise relevant to the proposal and are fully supportive of Dr. Paik’s research and career goals. These include Dr. Michael Jacobs (advanced radiological imaging), Dr. Laura Fayad (musculoskeletal radiology), Dr. Andrea Corse (muscle histopathology), Dr. Tom Lloyd (classification schemas in inclusion body myositis), and Dr. Ami Shah (scleroderma translational research). This K23 award will allow Dr. Paik to gain the skills needed to analyze and develop a classification schema of skeletal myopathy in scleroderma, develop expertise in advanced muscle MRI analysis, and build her clinical trial skill set to ultimately support a future R01 proposal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will establish a comprehensive, prospective myopathy cohort in systemic sclerosis (SSc or scleroderma) to ultimately devise a novel classification schema for SSc-associated myopathy that is predictive of outcomes such as treatment response, disability, cardiopulmonary disease trajectory, and death. Advanced muscle MRI techniques include diffusion weighted imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and T2 mapping will also be used to detect and quantify early muscle disease related changes in SSc associated myopathy. The knowledge gained from this study will lay the foundation for discovering predictive biomarkers of disease course and to allow future studies of the specific biological process involved in each phenotype.",Skeletal Myopathy in Systemic Sclerosis: Devising a Classification Schema Predictive of Outcomes,9892505,K23AR073927,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consensus', 'Creatine Kinase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Edema', 'Electromyography', 'Enrollment', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fibrosis', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Inclusion Body Myositis', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Process', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intramuscular', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Muscle Weakness', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Myopathy', 'Myositis', 'Necrosis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Heart Disease', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Rheumatology', 'Sampling Biases', 'Scleroderma', 'Serologic tests', 'Serological', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Systemic Scleroderma', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'career', 'clinical development', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'diffusion weighted', 'disability', 'disorder control', 'epidemiology study', 'high risk', 'illness length', 'imaging biomarker', 'interest', 'member', 'mortality', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive marker', 'professor', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiological imaging', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'skeletal', 'skills', 'treatment response', 'uptake']",NIAMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K23,2020,158743,0.07774165599072923
"Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis Abstract This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Danhong Wang, a physician-scientist at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wang is establishing herself as a young investigator in patient- oriented neuroimaging research on psychiatric disorders. This K01 award will provide Dr. Wang with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in patient-oriented research in psychiatric neuroimaging; (2) to conduct experimental investigations of neurobiological correlates in patients with psychosis; (3) to implement revolutionary individual-level functional mapping techniques in clinical studies; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wang has assembled a mentoring team comprised of three mentors: Dr. Dost Öngür, Chief of the McLean Hospital Psychotic Disorders Division, who leads a neuroimaging laboratory studying the biology of psychotic illness; Dr. Randy Buckner, Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience at Harvard University and Director of Psychiatric Neuroimaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, one of the pioneers in functional MRI research; and Dr. Suzanne Haber, Professor of Pharmacology and Physiology at the University of Rochester, a leading scientist in the field of neuroanatomy. In addition, Dr. Hesheng Liu, Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a computational neuroscientist with expertise in functional imaging, will collaborate on this project. Dr. Wang will engage in multiple career development activities to expand her ability to develop mechanistic insights about psychiatric disorders. These include new training in patient-oriented experimental research, a better understanding of the psychopathology of psychosis, and a stronger grasp of neuroanatomy. She will also receive advanced training in cognitive and clinical neuroscience. Determining the disconnected neural circuits underlying psychosis has proved elusive. Dr. Wang's research project aims to reveal circuitry abnormalities in psychotic patients using a subject-specific, cross-diagnostic approach. In Aim 1, Dr. Wang will establish methods for accurately characterizing the cortical and subcortical functional connectivity networks in individual patients. In Aim 2, leveraging a cross-diagnostic cohort of psychotic patients that will be scanned using the protocol optimized for individual-level functional analyses, as well as an existing patient data set, Dr. Wang will identify and validate cortical and subcortical functional connectivity abnormalities related to the severity of psychotic symptoms. In Aim 3, Dr. Wang will investigate the temporal variations of connectivity in individual patients and reveal abnormalities in dynamic functional connectivity related to symptoms. A series of preliminary studies conducted by Dr. Wang have laid the solid foundation for each specific aim. This research will form the basis of a study for identifying the “connectivity hubs” in individual patients for potential modulation, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K award. Narrative (no more than 250 characters): The goal of the proposed project is to develop reliable functional estimates at the single- subject level to reveal abnormalities in both static and dynamic functional connectivity relevant to psychosis. !",Understanding Functional Connectivity Abnormalities In Individual Patients with Psychosis,9974565,K01MH111802,"['Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain Pathology', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Portraits', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychology', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Solid', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'grasp', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'medical schools', 'mid-career faculty', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'patient oriented', 'patient oriented research', 'professor', 'psychotic symptoms', 'support vector machine', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2020,186155,0.11383759048319443
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes.

"Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Michael Mathis is a cardiothoracic anesthesiologist with board certification in anesthesiology and advanced perioperative echocardiography at the University of Michigan. Through completion of a T32 Research Training Grant, Dr. Mathis has developed expertise in perioperative outcomes research for patients with advanced cardiovascular disease. His long-term career goal is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF) through harnessing perioperative electronic healthcare record (EHR) data for early diagnosis and management. This proposal builds on Dr. Mathis's expertise, providing protected time for training in data science methods necessary to drive forward the analytic techniques proposed for improving HF diagnosis. Environment: The University of Michigan is the coordinating center for the Multicenter Perioperative Outcomes Group (MPOG), an international consortium of over 50 anesthesiology and surgical departments with perioperative information systems. Dr. Sachin Kheterpal, MD, MBA is the primary mentor for Dr. Mathis, and is the Director for MPOG and member of the NIH Precision Medicine Initiative Advisory Panel. The proposed research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Kheterpal, as well as co-mentors Milo Engoren, MD, Daniel Clauw, MD, and Kayvan Najarian, PhD. An advisory panel of experts in HF diagnosis and data science methodologies will provide Dr. Mathis with additional guidance. Background: HF is among the most common chronic conditions requiring hospitalization and carries high rates of mortality. In the perioperative period, HF is a risk factor for major cardiac complications. Despite advances in care, little progress has been made to reduce HF healthcare burden, with difficulties attributable to a lack of inexpensive, reliable diagnostic measures. Consequently, patients with HF can go unrecognized in early stages and do not receive treatments to reduce mortality. The perioperative period is an underutilized opportunity to improve HF diagnosis. Beyond the wealth of preoperative data available, the intraoperative period serves as a cardiac stress test through which hemodynamic responses to surgical and anesthetic stimuli are recorded with high resolution. Yet, this data remains an untapped resource for HF evaluation. Research: The goal of the proposed research is to incorporate the perioperative period as an opportunity for early diagnosis of HF. The two specific Aims are to develop a data-driven diagnostic algorithm for HF using preoperative EHR data (Aim 1) as well as intraoperative EHR data (Aim 2). Both aims will use automated techniques to extract features of HF from the perioperative EHR, developed at UM and scalable to multiple centers via the MPOG infrastructure. This work represents a paradigm shift in perioperative evaluation, using perioperative data as a diagnostic tool rather than a risk-assessment tool. The proposed research and training will provide Dr. Mathis with necessary data science computational experience to become an independent physician-investigator focused on improving perioperative management strategies for patients with HF. PROJECT NARRATIVE Public Health Relevance Statement: Heart failure is a common chronic condition affecting over 550,000 patients each year, with a 45–60% mortality rate at 5 years. Despite advances in treatment, little progress has been made to improve heart failure diagnosis, and thus patients in early heart failure stages do not receive appropriate life-extending therapies. Through robust data science methodologies, this study harnesses critically underutilized, high-fidelity data available during the perioperative period to improve diagnosis of heart failure .",Early Diagnosis of Heart Failure: A Perioperative Data-Driven Approach,9895469,K01HL141701,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Board Certification', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computational Science', 'Consumption', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Entropy', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intraoperative Period', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical History', 'Medical Records', 'Mentors', 'Methodological Studies', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thallium Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Stress Test', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'blood pressure variability', 'care providers', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2020,172274,0.06766076064981752
"Diabetic Retinopathy: genetics and neurodegeneration PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Diabetes mellitus (DM) is the leading cause of vision loss among working aged adults. Its prevalence is increasing and despite the strides in knowledge and treatments, our understanding of the pathways leading to vision loss in DM remains limited. Hyperglycemia and duration of DM contribute to but do not fully explain the predisposition to develop diabetic retinal diseases. Given the predisposition for diabetic retinal diseases to cluster in families, genetic risk factors are thought to be important but none has so far been definitively implicated. Furthermore, data from small studies suggest that there are more phenotypes of diabetic retinal disease than are currently recognized in clinical practice. Diabetic retinal disease has traditionally been considered primarily a vascular process: diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) are the main clinical manifestations. With improved imaging modalities and image analysis algorithms, there has been increasing recognition of a new clinical manifestation of diabetic retinal disease, diabetic retinal neurodegeneration (DRN). This is visible as alterations in thickness of retinal nerve fiber (RNFL) and/or ganglion cell layer (GCL) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. To date, DRN is poorly understood, and its role in clinical management of patients with DM has not been established. However, if retinal neurodegeneration occurs and is progressive, it can lead to profound visual difficulties for patients with DM. DRN may account for previously unexplained poor visual outcomes among patients with diabetic retinal disease despite standard of care treatment. Dr. Channa is a retina specialist, with prior research experience in retinal imaging and clinical trials of novel treatments for DME. In this K23 career development award she proposes to use a nationally representative dataset, the UK Biobank cohort to: 1) improve our understanding of DRN by determining RNFL and GCL thickness, using OCT imaging, in participants with DM (who have no DR or DME) compared to those who do not have DM 2) determine genetic factors associated with DR, DME and DRN. Dr. Channa proposes a career development plan, which includes mentorship, coursework, publications and clinical time. This will situate her as an independent clinician-scientist with expertise in translational research employing bioinformatics and computational skills in genomics and retinal image analysis to elucidate pathways of vision loss among patients with DM, ultimately leading to development of novel therapies. Her research work and career development will take place in the academic and collaborative environment of the largest medical center in the world, where she has institutional support and mentorship to develop as an independent clinician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this career development award we aim to use genetic and retinal imaging data to enhance our understanding of the pathways that can lead to vision loss among people with diabetic retinal diseases. Improved understanding will translate into interventions aimed at preventing blindness from diabetes.",Diabetic Retinopathy: genetics and neurodegeneration,9868630,K23EY030911,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Fundus', 'Future', 'Ganglion Cell Layer', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Nerve', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Retinal Ganglion Cells', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Specialist', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'biobank', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'diabetes management', 'diabetic', 'disability', 'experience', 'family genetics', 'fiber cell', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'macular edema', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'population based', 'prevent', 'retinal imaging', 'screening', 'skills', 'standard of care']",NEI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K23,2020,290835,0.06126580313588171
"Optimizing measurement of mindfulness meditation using brain pattern classification. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The candidate Dr. Helen Weng is seeking a K08 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award for her career goal to gain mentorship and training to develop the EMBODY Task, a more objective and precise functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measure of meditation practice that uses multivariate brain pattern classification methods. Dr. Weng earned her doctorate in clinical psychology researching the neural and behavioral effects of compassion meditation, and completed a NCCIH-funded postdoctoral fellowship at the UCSF Osher Center for Integrative Medicine (OCIM), where she studied mindful body awareness. Dr. Weng is rigorously trained in fMRI to study contemplative neuroscience; however, she is primarily trained in using standard univariate analyses, which average across spatial and temporal information. She aims to develop novel fMRI tasks that use multivariate methods which optimize spatial and temporal data to study brain states trained by meditation. Obtaining this K08 would support Dr. Weng’s long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator who studies the therapeutic benefits of meditation.  Dr. Weng’s career development plan includes training in the cognitive neuroscience of attention, fMRI pattern classification, and clinical trial methods to study meditation training. Dr. Weng has assembled a stellar mentoring team including top experts in cognitive neuroscience (Primary sponsor: Dr. Adam Gazzaley, UCSF Neuroscape Director; Dr. Melina Uncapher, Dr. David Ziegler), mindfulness-based interventions (Co-Sponsor: Dr. Rick Hecht, UCSF OCIM Research Director), and pattern classification (Dr. Bin YU, UC Berkeley). Dr. Weng’s training environment is at UCSF, a top NIH-funded research institution, and she will have access to state-of-the-art neuroimaging facilities at the Neuroscape Center and resources from OCIM, a flagship center for studying meditation. She will be mentored by her team, and complete trainings and coursework.  Dr. Weng’s K08 research proposal aims to develop the EMBODY Task, a novel fMRI task that uses brain pattern classification to decode the focus of attention during a period of breath meditation. This task will more accurately measure mental states during meditation by using precise information from individuals’ unique neural signatures. The task will distinguish neural patterns associated with attention (breath attention) and inattention (mind wandering, self-referential processing) to the breath, and use these patterns to identify fluctuating brain states during ten minutes of breath meditation. This will produce objective brain-derived metrics of breath attention such as mean duration of attention, which can then be used to objectively assess outcomes of meditation training. She will develop and validate this task within experienced meditators and meditation novices. Dr. Weng will use this data to prepare future R01 proposals to adapt the EMBODY Task to measure other meditation skills, and use these measures to test how various meditation skills learned from MBIs are mechanistically related to decreased symptoms in clinical populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic pain is an enormous public health issue that affects 100 million Americans and costs more than $600 billion per year in treatments and lost productivity; and major depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States (6.7% prevalence in 2014) and carries the heaviest burden of disability among mental disorders (World Health Organization, 2010). Mindfulness-Based Interventions improve symptoms in chronic pain and depression; however, we do not currently understand what meditation skills learned from mindfulness-based interventions improve symptoms in chronic pain and depression, and this information is needed to improve treatment. This proposal will develop a more accurate and precise measure of meditation practice using brain imaging methods (functional MRI) that can identify attention states during meditation practice.",Optimizing measurement of mindfulness meditation using brain pattern classification.,9852574,K08AT009385,"['Affect', 'American', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Trials', 'Compassion', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development Plans', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Esthesia', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insula of Reil', 'Integrative Medicine', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Length', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Meditation', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Productivity', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'bodily sensation', 'career', 'career development', 'chronic depression', 'chronic pain', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cost', 'design', 'disability burden', 'experience', 'health training', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'inattention', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mental representation', 'mental state', 'mindfulness', 'mindfulness intervention', 'mindfulness meditation', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient population', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'skills', 'symptomatic improvement']",NCCIH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K08,2020,195966,0.06092852804603823

"Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches Project Summary/Abstract  Malaria afflicts ~198 million people yearly, with 438,000 malaria deaths due to Plasmodium falciparum, underscoring the need for a highly effective malaria vaccine. The first licensed malaria vaccine, RTS,S, may provide much-needed reductions in morbidity and mortality, but its modest efficacy in reducing clinical malaria in the target population of African infants leaves ample margin for improvement. A better understanding of immunity to P. falciparum in naturally exposed populations can inform efforts to improve malaria vaccine design. To date, there are no reliable correlates of protection from either symptomatic P. falciparum infection (clinical immunity) or parasitemia (sterile immunity). Systems biology utilizes computational modeling of large- scale data sets to elucidate complex biological networks and has the potential to reveal novel predictors and mechanisms of malaria protection when applied to well-designed clinical cohort studies.  In this project, the candidate proposes to assess immune predictors of natural protection from P. falciparum infection using systems biology approaches. By analyzing clinical data and blood specimens collected from a well-characterized, prospective cohort of Malian children who differ in their degree of immunity to P. falciparum infection, the candidate will address two main research aims: 1) determine immune parameters predictive of protection from symptomatic infection (clinical immunity) and protection from P. falciparum infection (sterile immunity) and 2) relate these immune parameters and outcomes to the ability of plasma obtained from these children to inhibit parasite invasion into liver and red blood cells in vitro. The practical implications of this work include identifying novel immune predictors and mechanisms of protection from P. falciparum infection and disease within the vaccine target population that could provide rational benchmarks for candidate malaria vaccines.  The candidate is firmly committed to a career in translational malaria research and systems biology and is strongly supported in his career and research goals by his mentors and his division at the Indiana University School of Medicine. He currently holds a position as an Assistant Professor of Medicine with 80% protected time for research, independent laboratory and office space, and funding for equipment. The current proposal includes a comprehensive mentorship and didactic plan to advance the candidate's skills and knowledge in biostatistics and computational biology required for developing expertise in systems biology. Under the guidance of his primary mentor, Dr. Chandy John, and his co-mentors, Dr. Wanzhu Tu, Dr. Lang Li, and Dr. Peter Crompton, he will advance his bioinformatics skills and learn predictive modeling methodologies that will be directly applied to this proposal. Completion of this comprehensive training plan will provide the candidate with the skills and experience necessary to become a successful independent investigator specializing in computational systems biology with a focus on host immunity to Plasmodium infection. Project Narrative Each year malaria afflicts ~200 million people and causes over 430,000 deaths, primarily among African infants. Although a first-generation malaria vaccine is now available, it is only modestly effective in the target population of African infants; thus, a better understanding of natural immunity to Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of malaria parasites, in young African children can inform efforts to develop the next generation of malaria vaccines. Using samples collected from young Malian children before and during natural P. falciparum infections, this study aims to identify predictors and mechanisms of malaria immunity that aid the development of future malaria vaccines.",Defining clinical and sterile immunity to Plasmodium falciparum infection using systems biology approaches,9854874,K08AI125682,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Africa', 'African', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Models', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Equipment', 'Erythrocytes', 'Exposure to', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Hepatocyte', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'Interferon Type II', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Malaria', 'Malaria Vaccines', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Outcome', 'Parasitemia', 'Parasites', 'Plasma', 'Plasmodium falciparum', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective cohort', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Models', 'Sterility', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Target Populations', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'field study', 'improved', 'in vitro activity', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malaria transmission', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'parasite invasion', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'professor', 'prospective', 'response', 'skills', 'surveillance data', 'transcriptomics', 'vaccine candidate']",NIAID,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K08,2020,185224,0.02989905402695118

Dr. Pittenger has a long-standing commitment to mentorship; most notably, he is Co-Director of the Neuroscience Research Training Program (NRTP), the research track within the Yale psychiatry residency.  The training plan supported by this grant will allow Dr. Pittenger to increase his skills in quantitative analysis, with a focus on advanced statistical methods and on the design and analysis of fMRI studies. These are areas in which he already has active research with expert collaborators; the aim of the proposed training plan is to enhance his own proficiency to make him a more effective collaborator and mentor in these important domains. Additional training is focused on his own abilities as a mentor and leader, with the goal of increasing his efficacy in the management of his own research groups and in effective and individualized mentorship. These training activities will take place in the context of two NIMH- funded research studies. The first, R01 MH116038, is a recently funded grant on which Dr. Pittenger is co-PI with his close collaborator Alan Anticevic and deploys cutting-edge imaging technology and data analysis approaches to examine brain network connectivity parallels and predictors of therapeutic response to pharmacotherapy in OCD. The second, R01 MH100068, is a grant with collaborator Michelle Hampson that is developing real-time fMRI neurofeedback as a probe and potential treatment for OCD, with promising early results. These two exciting projects provide a fruitful vehicle for the proposed training in statistics and neuroimaging.  Dr. Pittenger will devote substantial time to mentoring under this award. One major focus will be the NRTP; the plan is for him to take over as Director of this program over the next few years, and to take the lead in the next resubmission of our T32 grant in 2022. Support of this increased mentorship effort is a second major motivation for the current application. Dr. Pittenger will also provide mentorship to students, postdocs, and junior faculty in his own research program and throughout the Department of Psychiatry  Together, these integrated plans for training, research, and mentorship will support a well-established mid-career investigator whose robust research program is producing important insights into the neurobiology and treatment of OCD and TS, and whose dedicated mentorship efforts are helping to establish a new generation of translationally grounded patient-oriented researchers in psychiatric neuroscience. NARRATIVE This K24 Mid-Career Investigator Career Development Award in Patient-Oriented Research seeks support for Christopher Pittenger, a tenured Associate Professor of Psychiatry at Yale University and Director of the Yale OCD Research Clinic; training and mentorship activities supported by this award will take place in the context of two NIMH-funded projects, R01 MH100068 and R01 MH116038.

"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9983016,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'risk prediction model', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2020,169005,0.019725075357328883
"Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease Project Summary/Abstract The applicant Udo Hoffmann MD MPH is a Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and the Chief of the Division for Cardiovascular Imaging in the Department of Radiology at MGH. Dr. Hoffmann has established a patient oriented research (POR) program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research methods to demonstrate the value of advanced cardiovascular imaging. Dr. Hoffmann has published approximately 380 peer reviewed papers, among them many in premier medical journals and has received continued independent, peer-reviewed POR NIH funding since 2005. He is among the very few faculty members at Harvard Medical School who are both the PI and Director of a highly successful NHLBI funded T- 32 program (Cardiac MR and CT Research) and a recipient of a K24. Dr. Hoffmann has successfully mentored more than 60 clinical investigators, most of which currently hold faculty positions in major academic centers and actively perform POR. Moreover, Dr. Hoffmann has successfully accomplished all mentoring and scientific goals of the first K24 award period. Overall, these achievements document Dr. Hoffmann's long standing passion and commitment to POR. His excellent publication, funding, and mentoring record together with his current and planned research support provide an excellent foundation to accomplish the aims of this competitive renewal of the K24 Award “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. Dr. Hoffmann proposes a mentoring and research plan that utilizes the synergies of past, ongoing, and future highly innovative independent research projects with educational and training opportunities offered by the cardiac MR CT PET Program, the T32 training program in cardiovascular imaging, the Harvard CTSA, and the Harvard School of Public Health. The specific aims addressing the charge of the K24 Award are to enable Dr. Hoffmann to: 1) dedicate 25% of his time to mentor clinical investigators based on NIH or equivalent funded projects in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”, 2) to mentor junior and mid-career clinical investigators with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants, and 3) to continue to expand a POR program that combines translational, clinical, and outcomes research to develop future leaders in clinical research in cardiovascular imaging and beyond. The research plan encompasses four specific aims: 1) To determine the effects of statin treatment on coronary atherosclerosis in HIV patients in 800 patients with HIV randomized to statin therapy vs. placebo, 2) To determine whether high risk coronary plaque predicts cardiovascular events in 4600 patients with clinical suspicion of CAD, 3) To determine the cost effectiveness of CT FFR in patients with stable and acute chest pain, and 4) To use Radiomics to identify novel imaging markers predicting cardiovascular events in participants of the Framingham Heart Study. Narrative This research takes advantage of a rich body of independent funded research in “Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease”. It will permit Dr. Hoffmann to dedicate 25% of his time to mentor junior clinical investigators from the T32 program and the pool of residents, fellows, and junior faculty in Cardiology and Radiology with the goal to develop them into clinical researchers who can successfully compete for peer reviewed grants. In addition, it will allow to expand a patient orientated research program that combines innovative translational, clinical, and outcomes research in cardiovascular imaging and that provides an ideal environment to develop future leaders in clinical research.",Cardiovascular Imaging in Ischemic Heart Disease,9914877,K24HL113128,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Age', 'Antiinflammatory Effect', 'Area', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Charge', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Paper', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Peer Review Grants', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Risk stratification', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'career', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'markov model', 'medical schools', 'member', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'sex', 'skills', 'synergism', 'training opportunity']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K24,2020,120852,0.07785645955444652
"The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Dr. Anjali Gopalan, MD, MSHP is a board-certified Internist at the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) Oakland Medical Center and a Research Scientist I (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at the KPNC Division of Research (DOR). With the proposed K23 mentored career development award, Dr. Gopalan will gain the advanced training and expertise necessary to become an independent investigator who can develop and implement tailored interventions for patients with early-onset type 2 diabetes (EOT2D). By focusing on adults with EOT2D, she seeks to address the comparatively poor micro- and macrovascular outcomes in this population that may result partly from inadequate management of hyperglycemia and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. Dr. Gopalan’s research premise posits that it is particularly critical for newly diagnosed patients with EOT2D to achieve early disease control, since tighter glycemic control during the year following diagnosis confers long-lasting micro- and macrovascular benefits. In support of the premise, the Research Aims of this K23 are to: 1) use electronic health record [EHR] data to identify EOT2D patient subgroups at highest risk of inadequate early disease control, 2) identify barriers to and facilitators of initial EOT2D management, and 3) examine prospective associations between patient-reported factors (e.g., disease-related distress, health literacy) and inadequate early disease control. The proposed research will be supported by experienced mentors and advisors, as well as advanced training in the following areas: 1) the use of advanced statistical modeling, 2) qualitative data analysis to inform intervention development, 3) the role of social determinants in health, and 4) implementation science. KPNC and DOR are ideal environments for the proposed work. KPNC is an integrated learning healthcare delivery system with a diverse membership of 4.2 million people (>350,000 with diabetes). DOR has a long track record of effectively training early stage investigators and has well-established internal research programs and collaborative relationships with nearby institutions that provide the infrastructure needed for career development. This environment, along with the proposed Research and Training Plans and an outstanding mentorship team, will enable Dr. Gopalan to continue to build the skills and generate the foundational data needed to submit an R01-level proposal during the final years of the proposed award period. In this planned R01, Dr. Gopalan will refine and implement an intervention (with a design based on the results of the three K23 Research Aims) to improve early care for newly diagnosed EOT2D patients and evaluate its impact on early outcomes in this growing, high-risk population. In summary, the proposed K23 award will support the career development of Dr. Gopalan and is vital to her acquiring the skill set and expertise required to become a successful, independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at a younger age have higher rates of complications than those diagnosed later in life. Given the lasting benefit conferred by early disease control, the initial care provided to this growing, high-risk population is particularly crucial. With this proposed career development award, Dr. Gopalan will acquire the research skills necessary to identify patients at highest risk for inadequate early disease control, define barriers to initial disease management, and develop an intervention designed to improve the care of adults (ages 21-44) with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",The initial care of younger adults with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes,10001486,K23DK116968,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Award', 'California', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Face', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypertension', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Internist', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population', 'Population Characteristics', 'Provider', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Smoke', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trees', 'United Kingdom', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diabetes education', 'diabetes management', 'disorder control', 'eHealth', 'early onset', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health literacy', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'literacy', 'macrovascular disease', 'member', 'older patient', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'racial and ethnic', 'skills', 'social determinants', 'social stigma', 'therapy design', 'therapy development', 'young adult']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,K23,2020,192914,0.08438376168246324

"Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD ABSTRACT The goal of this NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to provide an organized scientific and educational environment for Dr. Timothy Kline to begin his transition into an independent research career focused on developing novel imaging technologies and image analysis techniques for abdominal organ pathologies. This proposal outlines a five-year training plan at Mayo Clinic under the primary mentorship of Dr. Bradley Erickson and a Mentoring Team comprised of accomplished researchers in the fields of: biology, nephrology, genetics, radiology, informatics; medical physics, biostatistics, image processing, and physiology. The focus of this proposal is to improve both research studies and disease prognosis for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) patients through biomedical imaging techniques. It is well understood that imaging is essential for ADPKD diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Clinical studies utilize total kidney volume (TKV) (as measured by MRI as an image-based biomarker) to follow the progression of ADPKD, as larger TKVs have been shown to correlate with worse prognosis in both human and animal-model studies. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming, costly, and poorly standardized. The introduction of automated approaches for measuring TKV will: greatly improve measurement throughput, significantly reduce costs associated with performing research studies, allow accurate and reproducible measurements to be obtained both within and across institutions; facilitate the search for new imaging biomarkers. The specific aims of this project are to: (i) develop and validate automated tools to characterize renal structure, such as TKV and cystic burden; (ii) explore new imaging biomarkers by image texture feature analysis and pattern recognition techniques; and (iii) develop a new technique to measure renal blood flow. This research will be facilitated by Mayo Clinic's outstanding clinical and research environment dedicated to improving patient care, as well as the Mayo Clinic Translational PKD Center, which focuses on translating basic science research into improvements in the management and treatment of ADPKD patients. Dr. Kline's background in imaging technologies and image processing makes him particularly suited to perform this research. In addition to the above aims, Dr. Kline will: 1) develop a strong knowledge base in both nephrology and radiology by attending relevant rounds, seminars, and national conferences; 2) enhance his knowledge of medical imaging, biology, physiology, genetics, and programming through coursework and mentoring; 3) attend workshops focused on grant and publication writing; and 4) submit a highly competitive R01 application expanding upon the findings from this research proposal. This proposal will lead to vast improvements to current analysis workflows, as well as an improved understanding of the prognostic power of new imaging biomarkers of ADPKD. Obtaining this K Award will greatly facilitate Dr. Kline's transition into a prosperous independent research career. Narrative Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders and is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Total kidney volume (TKV) has become the main image-based biomarker for following ADPKD progression. However, there are challenges with using TKV as a marker of disease progression. For one, it is a simplification of the disease state and does not inform on microscopic disease processes that are involved with piecemeal destruction of healthy renal tissue. In addition, measurements of TKVs are time consuming and costly. This project will develop automated tools to increase measurement throughput, and explore new image-based biomarkers that will significantly add to the assessment of patient prognosis, and will have the ability to more quickly judge the effectiveness of interventions.",Advanced MR Imaging and Image Analytics as a Precision Medicine Tool to Manage ADPKD,10011565,K01DK110136,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Cyst', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'End stage renal failure', 'Environment', 'FarGo', 'Fibrosis', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Hepatic Cyst', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nephrology', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Tissue', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resolution', 'Spin Labels', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Writing', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disease diagnosis', 'educational atmosphere', 'functional decline', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'kidney vascular structure', 'knowledge base', 'novel imaging technology', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'prognostic value', 'radiological imaging', 'renal artery', 'research study', 'shear stress', 'symposium', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K01,2020,154915,0.029930295322296886
"Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach ABSTRACT The etiology of type 2 diabetes (T2D) likely involves a complex interaction of polygenic, metabolic, and environmental factors including diet. Accumulating experimental, epidemiological, and clinical evidence supports a pathogenic role of chronic inflammation in T2D development. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these findings are largely unknown, and current evidence on the causal relationships between specific inflammatory pathways and T2D risk is inconclusive. Advances in omics technologies have led to the identification of genes and metabolites associated with T2D risk, but data on mechanisms and causality are still very limited. Multi-omics integration in the framework of systems epidemiology may provide new avenues to enhance our understanding of disease mechanisms. To systematically investigate the relation between chronic inflammation and T2D, I propose to examine 3 Specific Aims by leveraging the rich resources in the UK Biobank, Nurses’ Health Studies (NHS), Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SOL), and Genotype-Tissue Expression project (GTEx). In Aim 1 [K99], I will integrate existing genomic data from the UK Biobank, NHS/HPFS, SOL, and transcriptomic data in the GTEx to examine shared genetic architectures between systemic inflammatory markers and T2D and whether polygenic susceptibility to chronic inflammation confers T2D risk. Meanwhile, I will receive extensive training in T2D systems biology and cutting-edge high-dimensional data analytics and bioinformatics. In Aim 2 [R00], I will integrate dietary and metabolomic data to examine metabolomic profiles mediating the association between dietary inflammatory potentials and T2D risk in the prospective NHS/HPFS and the SOL. In Aim 3 [R00], I will conduct plasma proteomic profiling in a nested case-control study within the NHS to identify inflammatory protein networks in relation to T2D risk, and as a Secondary Aim, integrate findings from Aim 1-3 to explore T2D-related pathways co-regulating at multiple biological dimensions. Findings from this project may improve the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms underlying T2D and identify novel targets/pathways suitable for early detection and prevention. I will be mentored/advised by an interdisciplinary team that includes Dr. JoAnn Manson (diabetes epidemiologist), Dr. Liming Liang (expert in statistical omics methodologies), Dr. Frank Hu (nutritional epidemiologist), Dr. Peter Kraft, (statistical geneticist), Dr. Qibin Qi (genetic epidemiologist), Dr. Towia Libermann (expert in proteomics), and Dr. Clary Clish (expert in metabolomics). The outstanding training opportunities with key leaders in these areas will provide me advanced knowledge and skills, positioning me for a successful, independent career as a diabetes epidemiologist with expertise in systems biology and integrated-omics. This project aligns with the NIDDK’s goal of integrating multi-omics technologies into diabetes research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to systematically examine the relationship between chronic inflammation and type 2 diabetes (T2D) by incorporating multi-omics data from several large prospective cohort studies. The proposed research will yield novel evidence on the biological mechanisms underlying the relationship between chronic inflammation and T2D risk. Novel pathways, and specific genes, proteins, and metabolites identified in this research will serve as the critical first steps for future development of biomarkers and therapeutic targets for T2D prevention and treatment.",Chronic Inflammation and Type 2 Diabetes: A Multi-omics Approach,10003234,K99DK122128,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetes prevention', 'Diet', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Food', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos', 'IL6 gene', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Interleukin-6', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Limes', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nurses&apos', ' Health Study', 'Nutritional', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plasma', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Qi', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retinal Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Study of Latinos', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'TNFRSF1A gene', 'Technology', 'Training', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'Work', 'adiponectin', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker development', 'cardiometabolism', 'career', 'case control', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'diabetes risk', 'disorder prevention', 'genetic architecture', 'genomic data', 'genomic locus', 'high dimensionality', 'i(19)', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'response', 'skills', 'therapeutic target', 'training opportunity', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NIDDK,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2020,89999,0.03932546609177207
"Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is an application for a K01 award for Dr. Karen Schliep, a tenure-line Assistant Professor of Public Health at the University of Utah. Dr. Schliep is establishing herself as a young investigator in women’s life-course epidemiology, specifically in a novel area of aging research—to improve our understanding of women’s increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (RD) and create women-specific interventions to mitigate risk and improve outcomes. This award will allow Dr. Schliep to achieve her goal of research independence by providing her support to accomplish the following training aims: 1) develop expertise in biomedical informatics and population-based research methods; 2) gain experience in the conduction of clinical cognitive health assessments; 3) enhance knowledge of modifiable factors affecting women’s mid- and late-life cognitive health; and 4) expand skills to independently lead and manage a successful research program. Dr. Schliep has assembled a mentoring team comprising a primary mentor, Dr. Michael Varner, an obstetrician and nationally renowned maternal-fetal medicine investigator with expertise in pregnancy complications including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), and two co-mentors: Dr. Norman Foster, a cognitive neurologist and geriatric neurologist and recognized leader in dementia research, and Dr. Ken Smith, an internationally known expert in population-based analyses and genetic/family epidemiology. Dr. Schliep has five advisors with expertise in classification modeling, ADRD neuropsychology, mid-life women’s health, longitudinal and survival data analysis, and chronic disease epidemiology.  Little is known regarding the association between HDP, estimated to complicate 2–8% of all pregnancies, and long-term adverse maternal neurological outcomes with similar inflammatory vascular etiologies, including ADRD. An estimated 5.4 million Americans currently suffer from ADRD, two-thirds of whom are women. As the US aging population increases, prevalence of dementia is expected to approach 13.2 to 16.0 million cases by 2050. Why ADRD disproportionately affects women is not known. Dr. Schliep’s research objective is to develop classification models for the various dementia subtypes (including AD, vascular dementia, Lewy body dementia, and frontotemporal dementia) to analyze longitudinal, individual-level data to better understand how HDP may increase a woman’s risk for ADRD. Dr. Schliep will accomplish this through the following research aims: 1) increase accuracy of ADRD diagnoses within health administrative databases; and 2) investigate the association between HDP and ADRD, and mid-life mediating factors. The proposal’s expected outcomes include 1) a novel method to accurately capture dementia cases within large linked health administrative databases; 2) clarity on how HDP may be linked with specific dementia subtypes; and 3) skills, experience, and preliminary data for Dr. Schliep to support future studies identifying other sex-specific risk factors for dementia and mediating factors amenable to interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Women have a two-fold higher lifetime risk for Alzheimer Disease (AD), vascular dementia, and related dementias (RD) compared to men. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including preeclampsia, eclampsia, and gestational hypertension, may contribute to sex differences in ADRD, with midlife experiences such as depression influencing the magnitude of risk. We propose to 1) create a model that can identify AD and related dementias in a large health administrative database; and 2) test the link (and mediating factors) between hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and ADRD, which will serve as the first step towards creating women’s tailored intervention that can mitigate ADRD risk for women.","Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy and Subsequent Risk of Vascular Dementia, Alzheimer's Disease, or Related Dementia: A Retrospective Cohort Study Taking into Account Mid-Life Mediating Factors.",9892855,K01AG058781,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease care', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eclampsia', 'Elderly', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Fertility', 'Fostering', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lewy Body Dementia', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Life course epidemiology', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Memory', 'Menopause', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurologist', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Population Database', 'Population Research', 'Population Study', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reproductive Health', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sex Differences', 'Social Environment', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Vascular Dementia', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'administrative database', 'aging population', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'dementia risk', 'epidemiology study', 'experience', 'family genetics', 'health assessment', 'health difference', 'high risk', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lifetime risk', 'men', 'middle age', 'mortality risk', 'normotensive', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'pregnancy disorder', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'prevent', 'professor', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reproductive', 'sex', 'skills', 'sociodemographics']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,K01,2020,124188,-0.017994149575903548
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism Project Summary/Abstract According to the latest estimates, over 1 in 7 Americans will develop an Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) over the course of their lifetime, and alcohol consumption is involved in nearly 4% of deaths worldwide. Thus, AUDs represent a significant public health concern. Currently, the best pharmacotherapies for AUDs require the treatment of 10 patients to observe 1 patient reduce drinking to healthy levels. For this reason, one appealing option is to identify at-risk individuals before they become heavy drinkers; for instance a family history of alcoholism is currently among the best predictors of AUD. Adolescence presents an ideal period to study these factors as it precedes the onset of AUDs but is also a time when there is a rapid increase in consumption. We have recently shown that neuroimaging measures can be used to predict clinically meaningful outcomes (e.g. relapse), suggesting it would also be possible to develop neuroimaging as a predictor of onset of heavy drinking in adolescents. Developing predictive tools to identify adolescents likely to progress to heavy drinking would offer the opportunity for early intervention and could potentially reduce the progression to AUD. Substantial evidence suggests that primary motives for problematic drinking are to enhance positive valence and reduce negative valence emotions. Further, substance use disorders are associated with altered activity in the insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and anterior cingulate cortex when processing potential rewards and aversive outcomes. We hypothesize that individuals at risk for AUDs will show heightened response to aversive stimuli in the anterior insula and amygdala and heightened response to rewarding stimuli in the ventral striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. We further hypothesize that they will exhibit diminished functional connectivity between reward, salience, and executive control networks. To test this, we will recruit 70 adolescents aged 18–20. Half will be have a biological parent with an AUD. The other half will be a control group matched on current drinking levels, age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All participants will undergo a functional MRI scan with a resting state run and a run during a modified version of the monetary incentive delay task that includes the risk of hearing an aversive sound (i.e. a loud scream). All participants will be followed for 6 months after the scan to determine levels of drinking. This study will provide both mechanistic information on risk for AUD as well as a tool to identify adolescents at greatest risk prior to the onset of problem drinking. This information could help provide personalized information about risk that may maximize likelihood of AUD prevention. In addition to the research goals described above, this is a training proposal that is designed to facilitate the transition of the primary investigator, Dr. Joshua Gowin, from mentored post-doctoral research fellow to independent, tenure-track research faculty at an academic institution. The mentored phase of the proposal will use a multifaceted training plan to improve Dr. Gowin’s knowledge base as well as his research and professional skillsets. Specifically, Dr. Gowin will learn new techniques in resting state functional connectivity analysis and in the cognitive neuroscience of emotion regulation. In addition to this scientific training, Dr. Gowin will gain experience management, teaching, and data presentation. To achieve these goals, Dr. Gowin has assembled a team of advisors from the intra- and extramural community with expertise in these areas to guide his training and development. This committee will include Dr. Vijay Ramchandani-NIAAA, Dr. Monique Ernst-NIMH, Dr. Elliot Stein-NIDA, and Dr. Susan Tapert-UCSD (see letters of support). The skills that will be developed during the mentored phase will position Dr. Gowin for success as he applies for an independent position and establishes his own research program. Project Narrative  Alcohol use disorders will affect over one in 10 Americans over the course of their lifetime. The early identification of individuals at greatest risk may provide opportunities to educate or provide services that mitigate individual risk. Therefore, identifying risk factors for alcohol use disorders is an important goal for researchers. One emerging target for research involves using functional MRI to study brain systems that contribute to risk. This project will explore the neural correlates of positive and negative valence emotional processing and how they contribute to risk for the development of alcohol use disorders. Better understanding of these neural processes could inform us about how alcohol use disorders emerge and, importantly, how we might prevent them.",Neural Correlates of Emotion Regulation in Youth at Risk for Alcoholism,10004489,R00AA024778,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker', 'Alcoholism', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Control Groups', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Extramural Activities', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Hearing', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Insula of Reil', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Loudness', 'Matched Group', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Negative Valence', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personality', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Review Literature', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Targeted Research', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Youth', 'aged', 'alcohol risk', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'drinking', 'drinking behavior', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'faculty research', 'financial incentive', 'follow-up', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning algorithm', 'negative affect', 'neural correlate', 'neuroimaging', 'positive emotional state', 'predicting response', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relapse prediction', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'underage drinking']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R00,2020,249000,-0.014520883918956388
