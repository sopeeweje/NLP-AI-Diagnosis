"Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs Project Abstract for HealthTech Solutions Kidney transplantation is a clinically effective and cost-effective treatment for patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and diabetes. Twenty-two patients die each day waiting for a transplant and 30% of all deaths in the US could be prevented by organ transplant. Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effective advantages of kidney transplantation, there has been a decades-long rise in the kidney discard rate from 5.1% in 1988 to 19.2% in 2015. During a successful Phase I grant and to address the need for a dedicated communications system to help improve transplant patient outcomes and achieve greater donated organ utilization, HealthTech Solutions (HTS), Inc. developed a proprietary mobile application for secure team communication tailored specifically for kidney transplant teams. To further improve communication efficiency and augment critical decision making in healthcare, specifically for surgeons, HTS will employ machine learning (ML) powered clinical decision support. Clinical decision support (CDS) may significantly increase access, increase quality, and reduce the cost of kidney transplantation. The proposed project is designed to further test and quantify the improvement of the donor management, coordination process, and kidney utilization outcomes using the company’s CDS and communication infrastructure for medical team communication. The aims are; 1) Develop CDS models specifically for transplant professionals aimed at improving decision times and decision confidence. Develop the CDS infrastructure capable of handling medical data and serving insights safely, securely, and rapidly; 2) Asses usability by working with a test group to exceed usability criteria and ensure that CDS meets clinician needs through user feedback iterations. Verification of utility from a diversified testing group (n=10) that represent every type of professional involved in transplant cases. 3) Measure the effects of TXP Chat enhanced with CDS after live clinical implementation in the kidney offer and procurement processes for more than 3,000 offers (1,500 with CDS and 1,500 control) over a period of 365 days with multiple partner institutions (n=3). TXP Chat and CDS will demonstrate to be reliable, secure, trustworthy and useful by the clinical/technical community, increase kidney acceptance practices resulting in an increase in kidney transplants, reduction in cold ischemic time, and reduction in time from offer to transplant. Ultimately, these metrics have been demonstrated in the literature to improve patient outcomes, reduce expensive chronic treatment costs (e.g. dialysis), reduce patient deaths from lack of kidney availability, and significantly improve human health and productivity. Study results will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Aim 1 will lay the foundation for further development to enable wider CDS in the Phase IIB. Aim 2 will prove physician support and steady adoption trend as we roll into commercialization. Aim 3 will provide multi-center pilot study data used to prove increased efficiency of the process in terms of time, money, and total number of kidneys transplanted. Project Narrative Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effectiveness advantages of kidney transplantation for many patients, nearly 1 in 5 kidneys authorized for donation are discarded. This project addresses the need for an efficient communications software technology enhanced with clinical decision support tailored for organ procurement organizations and transplant centers. Combined with enhanced communication efficiency, clinical decision support powered by machine learning may significantly improve donated kidney utilization and increase the number of viable, but currently unused organs that could otherwise be successfully transplanted, reducing waste and saving lives.","Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs",9845904,R44LM012575,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Direct Costs', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Multiple Partners', 'Organ', 'Organ Procurements', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Renal Glycosuria', 'Reporting', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplanted tissue', 'Treatment Cost', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'burnout', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'cohesion', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'mobile application', 'operation', 'prevent', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'transmission process', 'transplant centers', 'trend', 'usability', 'wasting']",NLM,ORGANIZER,R44,2019,512863,0.05759214115690196
"Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Critically injured patients have a four-fold higher risk of death from medical errors than other hospitalized patients, with nearly half of preventable deaths related to errors during the initial resuscitation phase. Although protocols, simulation, and leadership training improve team performance in this setting, as many as 12 protocol deviations per resuscitation have been observed, even with experienced teams. Given adverse outcomes that can result from performance gaps, there is a critical need to establish novel approaches for applying real-time decision support in critical-care settings. The long-term goal is to implement decision support for trauma resuscitation and other fast-paced, high-risk critical care settings that improves performance, reduces errors, and prevents adverse outcomes. The overall objective for this renewal is to vertically advance what was achieved during the first funding period by designing, implementing and testing an intention-aware recommender system that (1) recognizes and tracks current goals using sensor data, the output from patient monitors, and data captured from digital devices, (2) derives recommendations that support adherence to goal- based protocols, and (3) displays these recommendations in real time on wall displays. The central hypothesis is that decision support aligning with intentions (“intended” or “current” goals) will enhance protocol compliance, leading to improved outcomes related to trauma resuscitation. The rationale for this renewal is that recommendations supporting protocol compliance that are aligned with team intentions are more likely to be adopted by being less distracting and associated with lower cognitive load. Guided by preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) design and implement an automated real- time approach for predicting and monitoring the assessment and treatment goals of trauma resuscitation; and 2) generate and display a recommended plan of activities that supports current goal pursuit during trauma resuscitation. For the first Aim, machine learning approaches will be applied for recognizing goals using data obtained from sensors and other digital data sources. Under the second Aim, a machine learning strategy will be implemented and tested that generates recommendations responsive to team intentions. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on development of real-time methods that integrate goals as an input for making recommendations that meet the most current and relevant information needs. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to improve the care of severely injured and other critically ill patients by promoting timely and appropriate achievement of critical assessment and treatment goals in settings that remain at high-risk for medical errors. The results of this research continuum are expected to have an important positive impact on the outcome by addressing the mismatch between complex decision-making and human vulnerability to error that remain in critical care settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project is relevant to public health because it focuses on the design and implementation of a novel real-time decision support system that will reduce errors associated with adverse patient outcomes by providing recommendations that support the current information needs of multidisciplinary trauma teams. The proposed project is relevant to the part of the NLM's mission related to development of biomedical communications systems, methods, and technologies, and information dissemination and utilization among health professionals.",Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes,9739552,R01LM011834,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Information Dissemination', 'Injury', 'Intention', 'Leadership', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protocol Compliance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preference', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'radio frequency', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'success']",NLM,CHILDREN'S RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,709825,0.05211300294123483
"Deep radiomic decision support system for colorectal cancer Project Summary/Abstract Computer-aided detection (CADe) has been shown to increase readers’ sensitivity and reduce inter-observer variance in detecting abnormalities in medical images. However, they prompt relatively large numbers of false positives (FPs) that readers find tedious to review and, during this process, the readers can incorrectly dismiss true lesions prompted correctly to them by CADe systems. Thus, there is a demand for an advanced decision support system that would provide not only high detection sensitivity, but also high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a lesion. In this project, we propose to improve the detection specificity of CADe by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that can analyze the extrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the context of local anatomy, of target lesions, whereas current CADe systems consider only the intrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the shape and texture of detected lesions. Further, we can use DCNNs to provide an explanation of why a specific location was prompted by using anatomically meaningful object categories with similar-image retrieval of past diagnosed cases. In this project, we will focus on computed tomographic colonography (CTC), which is a minimally invasive screening method for early detection of colorectal lesions to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC), which is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Historically, however, only adenomas were believed to be precursors of CRC. Recent studies have revealed a molecular pathway where also serrated lesions can develop into CRC. Recent studies have indicated that CTC can detect serrated lesions accurately based upon the phenomenon called contrast coating. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop a deep radiomic decision support (DeepDES) system that leverages deep learning for providing high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of colorectal lesions, in particular, serrated lesions, and for providing diagnostic information that explains why a specific location was prompted as a lesion to assist readers in assessing detected lesions correctly. To achieve the goal, we will explore the following specific aims: (1) Develop a radiomic deep-learning (RAID) scheme for the detection of colorectal lesions, (2) develop a DeepDES system for diagnosis of detected lesions, and (3) evaluate the clinical benefit of DeepDES system. Successful development of the proposed DeepDES system will provide an advanced decision support that addresses the current concerns about CADe by yielding both high detection sensitivity and high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a target lesion. Broad adoption and use of the DeepDES system will advance the prevention and early diagnosis of cancer, and thus will ultimately reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in the United States.

"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment. Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,9816658,R01CA233487,"['Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Network', 'Bedside Testings', 'Benchmarking', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hostage', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Regimen', 'Regrets', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computer human interaction', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'experience', 'heuristics', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'irradiation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'oncology', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'radiation risk', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,451307,0.04698197308089971
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9782996,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics\xa0tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,348107,0.03412528619414915
"Big Data, Big Models, and Big Bias?: A decision making framework for vital rate estimates based on extrapolation Project Summary/Abstract The past decades have seen a flurry of methods that use extrapolation, smoothing, and other forms of information sharing to compensate for limited and incomplete data. In places without comprehensive vital registration or public health monitoring systems, extrapolation and information sharing techniques are particularly appealing, since there typically is simply not enough data available to produce estimates with sufficient temporal or spatial resolution to influence public health decision making. This proposal reframes uncertainty in extrapolated estimates of vital rates in terms of decision-making. A decision-making framework (i) is grounded in familiar language for policymakers and public health officials, (ii)characterizes consequential and inconsequential model decisions based on variability in outcomes, and (iii) in- corporates both extrapolation and sampling uncertainty. A cornerstone of this project is a novel collaboration with researchers and policymakers at the World Bank. Through this collaboration, we will pilot the proposed decision-making tools and conduct experiments with local and national policymakers in realistic settings. Project Narrative Predictions based on machine learning models are increasingly common inputs into decision making processes across scientific domains. In this proposal I develop and evaluate strategies for making public health decisions based on predicted vital rates, particularly in places without full coverage civil registration. Results from the project will improve strategies for allocating resources for disease surveillance and health monitoring in scarce resource settings.","Big Data, Big Models, and Big Bias?: A decision making framework for vital rate estimates based on extrapolation",9780910,DP2MH122405,"['Big Data', 'Collaborations', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Health', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Uncertainty', 'World Bank', 'base', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'novel', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,DP2,2019,2332500,0.06120055684823884
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies.

"Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will (1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial (standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4) analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness, familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have previously developed a computer decision support system for (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. If successfully deployed and utilized, CDSS-T will be a useful tool to aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor treatment response assessment. Improving the reliability in assessment of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying patients who do not respond to preserve their physical condition, thus allowing them to seek alternative treatment, which may reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from bladder cancer. In addition, the multi-site pilot clinical trial will provide an excellent opportunity to experience the process of bringing laboratory research from bench to bedside, which will serve as a valuable guide for future development of clinically practical tools for various diseases.",Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer,9624294,U01CA232931,"['Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratory Research', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2019,653319,0.0021392208494799853
"Mobile-phone integrated rapid diagnostic tests to improve antibiotic stewardship PROJECT SUMMARY  An estimated 1.4 billion antibiotic prescriptions were filled in the US from 2000-2010. Despite a national antibiotic education campaign, approximately 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result of the over-prescription of antibiotics, there is a current and pressing public health need for improved antibiotic stewardship. Compounding this problem are new modalities of healthcare like telemedicine that, while meeting patient demand for convenience, have been shown to have higher antibiotic prescription rates. As a result, there is a pressing need for a tool that these remote providers can use to distinguish between bacterial infections, where antibiotics can be effective, and viral infections where antibiotics are unneeded.  In this research, we propose the development of Barcode Embedded Rapid Diagnostics (BERDs) as a point-of-care test to measure a host biomarker signature in response to an infection in blood. These tests have novel spatial patterning of reagents that allows them to automatically and quantitatively be analyzed by a mobile phone application. Once the biomarkers have been analyzed on the test, a clinical decision support engine developed in this proposal will provide a confident diagnosis.  We have assembled an interdisciplinary consortium that consists of biomedical engineering, point-of-care device, and software development expertise through PragmaDx, Inc., and biomarker assay development in the Department of Chemistry at Vanderbilt University. To meet our shared goals, our specific aims will: optimize manufacturing conditions of BERDs, develop and evaluate a machine learning clinical decision support engine, and rigorously compare the performance of BERDs to standard clinical laboratory methods using de-identified patient specimens.  A successful outcome of this Phase I STTR will be the development of a diagnostic test and clinical decision support engine that is capable of measuring multiple biomarkers in blood to differentiate the etiology of an infection at the point-of-care, with accuracy comparable to standard clinical laboratory assays. Upon completion of this effective demonstration, the platform will be ready for a large-scale clinical evaluation that will be the subject of a Phase II application. PROJECT NARRATIVE  An estimated 30% of antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary. As a result, antibiotic resistance has developed into a major public health concern.

"Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes Summary The objective of this proposal is to optimize the design and evaluate a robust artificial pancreas (R-AP) system for use in patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (T1D) with HbA1C greater than 8% and compare HbA1C outcomes in these patients relative to a decision support system that utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Although high risk patients have possibly the most to gain from usage of AP technology, they are oftentimes under-represented or excluded from clinical trials. This has been because of the increased risk of failure of these AP systems that were not designed to handle inconsistent reporting of meals, variable activity level, and infusion set failures. An AP system for high risk patients needs to be designed to achieve maximal benefit, including reducing the risk of acute and chronic complications. A major obstacle for enabling the AP for usage by high-risk patients is that these patients may be less compliant with use guidelines for the system including missed meal announcements, infrequent sensor calibrations, and prolonged infusion set wear leading to infusion set failures. In this grant, we will integrate new risk-mitigation features into the OHSU single-hormone AP to enable usage by high-risk patients that fall into the categories described above. We present new algorithms for automating the detection of missed meal announcements, missed calibrations, and robust handling of hybrid usage mode. While AP systems may be an optimal choice for improving glycemic control, many people with T1D prefer MDI therapy. Decision support systems such as the DailyDose decision support system developed at OHSU can be used to improve glycemic control for patients who prefer MDI therapy. The DailyDose decision support system is designed for CGM augmented MDI therapy. It enables on-demand calculation of insulin doses, automates insulin dose adjustments based on pattern recognition, and uses machine learning approaches to alert the patients to events such as predicted hypoglycemia and missed meal doses.The benefit of the DailyDose system is that it is a simple system and does not require use of an insulin pump, which may be a challenge for some patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes as pump therapy is more intensive and requires infusion set changes. It is unknown in this high risk group of people whether patient needs, quality of life, and glycemic control are best addressed with an AP system or decision support tool or if both treatments are appropriate. We have designed a 3-month clinical study to compare glycemic outcomes during AP vs. decision support interventions in a high- risk T1D cohort (HbA1C 8-10.5%), with the aim of demonstrating a significant clinically relevant reduction in HbA1C. Our hypothesis is that both AP and decision support therapies will decrease HbA1C relative to baseline but that the AP will provide further benefit over DailyDose. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. We propose to integrate features into the OHSU artificial pancreas to optimize it for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c>8-10.5%) and compare it to DailyDose, a decision support system that uses multiple daily injections.",Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes,9789266,R01DK120367,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Carbohydrates', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modification', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'design', 'engineering design', 'expectation', 'falls', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'patient population', 'primary outcome', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'risk mitigation', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'support tools']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,621247,0.04521719025692357
"Improve medical decision making in emergency medicine via a new interface to visualize and understand relevant prior history for complex patients at the point-of-care. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Patient Insight is working to drive more informed medical decisions by designing a real-time interface that dynamically captures and presents prior history for complex patients in less time and with more completeness than using their electronic health record (EHR) system. The company is developing proprietary data mining and natural language processing algorithms that show promise for identifying, aggregating, and displaying the most essential EHR data for patients with complex conditions while at the same time working with clinicians to design the visual interface to reduce the cognitive burden and support diagnosis and treatment decisions. The specific goals of this phase I project are to test the feasibility of developing Patient Insight’s core solution to (1) use advanced analytics and natural language processing to mine and prioritize the most relevant information for use by (ED) physicians and (2) develop an clinician-informed, visual display of that essential information to timely support clinical decision-making sufficient to reduce medical errors, improve health, and control costs. In phase I, Patient Insight will work with Universal Health Systems, the parent company of George Washington University Hospital, to co-develop and test the platform for efficacy in the ED as a precursor to continued development of this core solution/product. This will involve using EHR data to assess comprehensiveness to reconstruct history for five groups of chronically ill patients (e.g., advanced cancer, coronary heart disease, insulin-dependent diabetes, chronic pain, and schizophrenia) who are admitted with high-frequency chief complaints of abdominal pain, chest pain, and fever. This will include mining, prioritizing, and presenting information to clinicians using a total of 30 dimensions of data regarding patient’s prior ED and hospital visits including both structured (e.g., diagnosis, medications, labs, imaging test types, EKG date/time) and unstructured data (e.g., images, physician notes, consult notes) to establish physician consensus on the data most valuable to medical decision-making and co-design data visualization tools to render a clear patient history. Our aims include: (Aim 1) Establishing the feasibility of leveraging provider-as-user-centered design to guide development of a data visualization platform that enables providers to readily “see” the most complete patient record for the five groups of complex patients, and (Aim 2) Conducting usability testing and compare the completeness and efficiency of using the enhanced platform on the five patient categories with usual care. Success in phase I will enable the company to validate a ‘proof of concept’ for developing its clinician-as-user-centered design process to inform a phase II research and development effort to design a commercially viable clinical decision support tool for hospitals and health systems. PROJECT NARRATIVE Patient Insight seeks to determine the feasibility of its proposed platform to aggregate and present the clearest picture possible of a patient’s history for time-constrained emergency department (ED) providers sufficient to drive improved medical decision-making, safety, and improved health outcomes for complex patients at the point-of-care and across disparate EHR systems. The strategy is to leverage our capability to extract discreet and unstructured data from select EHR systems and engage providers in the design of key elements of information display to reduce duplicate testing, lower medical errors related to misinformed treatment choices, and reduce unnecessary treatment and costs. Proving feasibility will enable Patient Insight to structure a partnership with Universal Health Services and inform further development and testing of its core solution across multiple ED facilities.",Improve medical decision making in emergency medicine via a new interface to visualize and understand relevant prior history for complex patients at the point-of-care.,9778547,R43LM013130,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Adoption', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Award', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Chest Pain', 'Chronically Ill', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Consult', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Cost Control', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Element', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Elements', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intuition', 'Medical', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical History', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Schizophrenia', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Cost', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Visit', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Washington', 'Work', 'chronic pain', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive load', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'health information technology', 'improved', 'information display', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'medical specialties', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'point of care', 'research and development', 'stem', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment choice', 'unnecessary treatment', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NLM,"PATIENT INSIGHT, INC.",R43,2019,155520,0.025020903387543023
"Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a disease characterized by pancreatic beta destruction with subsequent insulin depletion. The alterations in glucose dynamics are incredibly difficult to manage and are confounded by meals, exercise, menstruation, and stress. Although automated insulin delivery systems are becoming commercially available, the large majority of people with T1D are treated with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI). Dangerous complications of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis can occur from failure to dose insulin correctly, however vigilant adherence to tedious insulin dosing strategies are difficult for MDI users maintain. This difficulty is magnified during exercise, which is critical to ameliorating long-term complications of diabetes; even when guidelines for insulin dosage adjustments are followed, acute hypoglycemia during exercise and night-time hypoglycemia can occur. In our recent survey of 1400 subjects living with T1D, the majority of subjects on MDI therapy were not confident in managing their glucose during exercise and felt they lacked tools to do so. In aggregate, difficult treatment schedules and bolus calculations, associated acute complications from daily activities, and the emotional and psychological toll of this chronic disease can result in treatment non-adherence and poor glycemic outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for decision support tools designed for MDI users to improve glycemic control surrounding meals, daily activities and exercise. The goal of this proposal to develop a decision support tool for patients with type 1 diabetes who utilize continuous glucose monitoring systems and multiple daily injection therapy. This tool will be called miTREAT, the multiple injection treatment recommender system for exercise-aware therapies. We hypothesize that use of a novel decision support tool equipped with content-based collaborative filtering methods and dynamic exercise hypoglycemia prediction algorithms will improve overall euglycemia and reduce time spent in hypoglycemia for patients on MDI therapy. In our first aim, we will leverage decades of research in computer science recommender systems and machine learning optimization strategies to develop a novel decision support system that identifies issues in glycemic control and recommends appropriate insulin dose and behavioral modifications. In our second aim, we will develop a new exercise model that reflects both the dynamics of rapid-uptake of glucose through GLUT-4 channels and the longitudinal biphasic insulin sensitivity profile. This new model structure will be used to predict hypoglycemia during and after the exercise period. In our third aim, we will explore the performance of our decision support engine in an in-vivo clinical trial. This clinical trial will assess the usability of a new smart-phone app designed to assist MDI users that we have developed at OHSU. In achieving these goals, we will develop the first decision support system that provides treatment and behavioral recommendations to patients on CGM-augmented MDI therapy. This system will improve overall time in euglycemia, and reduce the occurrence of acute complications surrounding exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 Diabetes is difficult to manage through multiple daily injections, and there is a paucity of tools available to assist patients with treatment decisions. In this proposal, the fields of computer science, machine learning, constrained optimization and clinical science are united to develop a novel decision support tool for multiple daily injection users. This is accomplished in three parts: 1) we will tune a decision support system to correctly identify issues in patient glycemic control and recommend appropriate treatment modifications; 2) we will develop a new hypoglycemia prediction tool that reflects the longitudinal dynamics of glucose uptake during and after exercise; and 3) we will explore the performance of this decision support system and hypoglycemia prediction tool in a clinical trial.",Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes,9758549,F31DK121436,"['Acute', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Assimilations', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Computer Simulation', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Cutaneous', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical Technology', 'Menstruation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Output', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Running', 'SLC2A1 gene', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Study Subject', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'computer science', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'dosage', 'e-commerce', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'glucose disposal', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose uptake', 'glycemic control', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insulin sensitivity', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'resistance exercise', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,50016,0.08847160531902842
"PhendoPHL:A Data-Science Enabled Personal Health Library to Manage Endometriosis PROJECT SUMMARY Endometriosis is a chronic condition which is estimated to affect 10% of women in reproductive age. It has a very high burden on quality of life and productivity, and the self-management needs of women living with the disease are multiple. This project aims to design, develop, and evaluate a data-science enabled personal health library called PhendoPHL to support the self-management needs of women living with endometriosis. Grounded in self-determination theory, and informed by user-centered design methods PhendoPHL will enable exploration of health patterns through interactive visualizations of integrated clinical and self-tracked data, identify temporal personalized patterns and comparison to population norms through novel data-science methods, and provide actionable visualizations of data for shared decision making during patient-provider encounters. PhendoPHL builds on our existing work in novel informatics methods for endometriosis, and the extensive experience of our research team in designing and evaluating novel informatics interventions. The proposed work also fills a research gap in personal health informatics: the development and validation of novel computational methods to identify personalized and population- based patterns in clinical and self-monitoring data; both types of data which are critical to successful self- management and challenging from a computational standpoint because they are temporal, heterogeneous, and sparse. Using a mixed-methods evaluation study (standardized surveys, logfile analysis, Critical Incident Technique interviews, focus groups), we will study PhendoPHL’s usability, assess the factors critical to user engagement and perceived impact on self-determination and shared decision making, and the generalizability to other reproductive chronic conditions in women’s health.

"TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS PROJECT SUMMARY With an associated mortality of 35%, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) contributes to the morbidity and mortality seen in many acute conditions such as pneumonia, influenza, sepsis, trauma and aspiration. Yet studies consistently show that ARDS is under-recognized in up to 40% of patients with generally low and variable adoption of practices shown to improve mortality in ARDS. The overall goal of this proposed project is to improve care delivered to ARDS patients by promoting accurate identification of patients with ARDS and increasing adoption of evidence-based interventions shown to improve outcomes in ARDS. With the recent publication of a multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS, this proposal specifically aims: 1) To increase identification of ARDS patients with an automated electronic tool (ARDS Sniffer 2.0) powered by the predictive analytics of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing. 2) To translate the recently published multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS into an evidence-based, context-appropriate, Electronic Clinical decision support system in ARDS (ECARDS) for the management of ARDS. This process will be informed by an expert panel from the CPG committee as well as a semi-qualitative analysis of the cognitive decision making process, data needs and workflow of users in a series of Think-Aloud studies and focus group interviews. ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ECARDS and an ARDS Dashboard to show near real-time data on the incidence of ARDS and rate of utilization of best care will then be incorporated within the hospital EMR for useability testing with another series of Think-Aloud and semi-qualitative studies. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ARDS Dashboard, and ECARDS in a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized control trial of 3 hospitals within the Montefiore Healthcare System to increase utilization of recommended interventions in ARDS and improve outcomes. 4) To promote the dissemination of the clinical decision support system through our partner professional organizations of American Thoracic Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and American Association of Respiratory Care and Program for Emergency Preparedness. Because of the high pressure, high acuity, and rapidly changing status of the acutely ill ARDS patient, clinical decision making often defaults to the automated, pattern-driven cognitive processes which are particularly prone to unconscious biases and errors and cognitive overload from large volumes of shifting data. As such, this proposal is the ideal research demonstration project to develop a new clinical decision support tool that will harness the power of big data and predictive analytics to identify ARDS in the hospital and deliver an evidenced-based, expert and user informed clinical decision support tool to clinicians at the right point during their clinical interaction and workflow with these patients in order to promote the right interventions to the right patients at the right time. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome constitutes the most severe form of respiratory failure in the hospital with an associated mortality of 35%, it is consistently under-recognized and proven treatments are underutilized. This proposal aims to harness the power of big data in the hospital information system to identify patients with ARDS and prompt clinicians with the evidence-based best management of this condition. By developing a computerized decision support system whose design is informed by the experts and the clinicians themselves, this proposal aims to bring the right care to the right patient at the right time to save lives and promote recovery from this devastating condition.",TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS,9763432,R18HS026188,[' '],AHRQ,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R18,2019,397898,0.07049516633828574
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9749260,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2019,564964,0.06579016453843936
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9749154,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Automated Clinical Decision Support', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,178606,0.10551310028761554
"Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Project Summary     Coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves the lives of patients with coronary disease (CAD) as a group,  but 20% of patients remain symptomatic one year after surgery. In clinical practice CABG decisions are largely  driven by stenosis severity determined from invasive angiography despite the known relevance of functional  CAD  parameters.  This  practical  impasse  will  continue  to  exist  without  clinically  available,  high-­resolution,  quantitative functional imaging, and a better understanding of the clinical outcomes in relation to anatomical  (angiography)  and  functional  (ischemia,  scar  tissue)  factors.  The  long-­term  goal  is  to  improve  outcome  of  CABG  through  personalized  imaging-­guided  care.  The  overall  objective  of  this  proposal  is  to  identify  determinants  of  myocardial  flow  restoration  (ischemia  reduction),  and  develop  integrated  imaging  tools  for  individualized,  lesion-­specific  CABG  decision-­making,  and  computational  flow  simulations  based  on  the  patient’s  anatomy  and  function  to  predict  the  hemodynamic  outcome.  Supported  by  studies  using  invasive  FFR-­guided  CABG,  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  research  is  that  integration  of  anatomical  (angiography)  and functional information (ischemia, scar tissue) will identify individual coronary vessels that will benefit from  revascularization, and individual optimization of surgical procedures by flow simulations will maximize clinical  benefit  of  CABG  for  patients  with  CAD.  Supported  by  promising  preliminary  data,  three  specific  aims  are  proposed:  1)  Prospectively  identify  angiographic,  functional  and  clinical  baseline  determinants  of  outcome  after CABG, defined as improvement of myocardial perfusion (ischemia reduction) and angina symptoms;; 2)  Develop  and  validate  a  comprehensive  imaging  strategy  and  clinically  applicable  tool  that  integrate  high-­ resolution  angiographic  and  quantitative  functional  information  (ischemia,  viability)  for  per-­vessel/lesion  revascularization  decisions;;  3)  Develop  and  validate  new  multi-­parametric  computational  flow  simulations,  with incorporation of functional imaging data, which allows for prediction of individual hemodynamic outcome  and  ultimately  surgical  optimization  based  on  virtual  hemodynamic  results.  This  approach  is  innovative  because  new  imaging  techniques  will  advance  the  field’s  understanding  of  CABG  physiology,  and  new  clinically applicable tools will be developed for comprehensive clinical decision-­making and optimized surgical  planning. The acquired knowledge and developed tools are applicable to other vascular contexts, and may  also  be  instrumental  for  new  therapeutic  innovations.  The  proposed  research  is  significant  because  identification  of  CABG  outcome  determinants,  and  new  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance,  have  the  potential  to  improve  the  effectiveness  (by  complete  functional  revascularization)  and  efficiency  of  CABG  (by  avoiding  futile  grafts).  For  a  large  group  of  patients,  these  innovations  will improve  the patient-­valued  benefit  of  CABG (complications, symptoms),  and also decrease  cost by improved efficiency of care.     Project Narrative    The proposed research is relevant to the public health because identification of CABG outcome determinants,  and  development  of  diagnostic  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance  of  CABG  surgery,  can  help  achieve  complete  functional  revascularization  and  restoration  of  myocardial  blood  flow  in  more  patients.  Thus,  the  proposed  research  is  relevant  to  the  NIH’s  mission  that  pertains  to  the  discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of  that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. ",Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery,9660276,R01HL141712,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intuition', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity -

"Quantitative Modeling Software with Applications to Medical Decision Making Project Summary/Abstract In recent years, health care systems and health care providers have made concerted efforts to practice evidence based medicine to provide patients with the best available information when making choices about their medical decisions. However, these decisions are often complex with many uncertainties and potential outcomes – some beneficial others dire. A popular tool used to help identify best treatment strategies is a decision tree, which outlines a patient's potential outcomes given an initial medical choice. Complex decision trees are evaluated via Monte Carlo microsimulation to trace a patient's path through the tree. This movement is inherently stochastic because outcomes are probabilistic; however, when the microsimulation is repeated many times, it provides the probability of each associated outcome resulting from the initial medical decision. From this probability distribution, quantitative measures associated with each medical decision can be calculated including beneficial as well as adverse events, life years, quality-adjusted life years (a generic measure of disease burden), and others. When outcome costs are known and incorporated into the model, cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) can be used to readily compute the relative costs, effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness for each health outcome. We propose to add functionality to the mathematical modeling software Berkeley Madonna to allow users to build decision trees and carry out Monte Carlo microsimulations on these trees (Aim 1). Berkeley Madonna's interface was designed to gently introduce students from non-technical fields into mathematical modeling by using a simple syntax and graphical images to construct sophisticated equations. We will leverage this easy-to-use interface to introduce medical researchers to microsimulation. The software will be adapted to build decision trees with built-in functions and customized graphics specific to this field, including measures from CEA. Patients moving through a decision tree using microsimulation must be simulated hundreds of thousands to millions of times to arrive at statistically significant outcome probabilities, and these simulations are computationally intense often requiring months of computer time. We will harness the power of graphics processing units (GPUs) to parallelize these simulations to achieve tremendous speedups compared to commercially available software, which have not taken advantage of these hardware capabilities. We show that a simple Monte Carlo microsimulation can be simulated 700x faster on a GPU compared to a CPU, and we will optimize the code to fully realize these speedups when simulating complex decision trees (Aim 2). Successful completion of our goals will provide a powerful research tool to the medical decision making field, which will positively impact health outcomes research. We expect that our software will be particularly beneficial to the cardiovascular research community, which has a history of practicing evidence-based medicine that includes simulation modeling. Project Narrative This proposal will expand the functionality of the mathematical software Berkeley Madonna to perform medical decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis using microsimulation. We will implement GPU-accelerated algorithms to dramatically increase calculations speeds, which will far outpace current industry standards. Successful completion of our goals will provide a powerful and user-friendly piece of software that will allow cardiovascular and other medical researchers to more easily construct and simulate decision models, which will positively impact health outcomes. 1",Quantitative Modeling Software with Applications to Medical Decision Making,9774898,R43LM013133,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Benchmarking', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost Measures', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Decision Trees', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Elements', 'Equation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Evidence based practice', 'Explosion', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Image', 'Industry', 'Industry Standard', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Research', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Simulation', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Probability', 'Publishing', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'cost outcomes', 'design', 'experience', 'graphical user interface', 'health economics', 'incremental cost-effectiveness', 'individual patient', 'interest', 'mathematical model', 'models and simulation', 'programs', 'relative cost', 'simulation', 'stem', 'syntax', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'undergraduate student', 'user-friendly']",NLM,"BERKELEY MADONNA, INC.",R43,2019,326600,0.06743039824585614
"Patient-Centered Comparative Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Surveillance in IBD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Surveillance colonoscopy decreases the risk of developing CRC and increases the detection of CRC at an early stage. However, only a small proportion of eligible patients with IBD engage in surveillance colonoscopy as recommended by current practice guidelines. There is a need to identify effective approaches to surveillance colonoscopy and how to effectively communicate individualized CRC risk to IBD patients in order to reduce the mortality burden of this fatal IBD complication. My long-term goal is to conduct and implement research to reduce the incidence and mortality of IBD-associated CRC. My central hypotheses are that patient experiences influence acceptance of CRC surveillance colonoscopy, subgroups of IBD patients benefit from surveillance colonoscopy, and that a patient-centered communication tool using these factors can aid patient decision making regarding CRC surveillance. The specific aims of my proposal are: Aim 1: Define IBD patient experiences throughout the process of surveillance colonoscopy. Aim 2(a): Compare the effectiveness of colonoscopy surveillance strategies on the yield of dysplasia or CRC, CRC stage, treatment, and CRC-related mortality in a national cohort of patients with IBD. Aim 2(b): Identify subgroups of patients with IBD who derive benefit (or harm) from surveillance colonoscopy. Aim 3: Translate patient experiences of colonoscopy and effectiveness of surveillance colonoscopy effectiveness into an IBD CRC communication tool for decision support. Future studies will test the effectiveness of the communication tool on CRC surveillance adherence, early stage CRC detection, and patient satisfaction with decision making. I will achieve these aims through a partnership with the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America to conduct in-depth interviews with patients with IBD regarding their experiences with colonoscopy and to conduct patient consensus panels to develop and refine a communication tool for CRC surveillance decision making. I will compare the effectiveness of colonoscopy surveillance strategies on outcomes of CRC in a cohort of approximately 63,000 patients with IBD in the national Veterans Health Administration datasets aided by natural language processing to define key IBD variables currently lacking using automated administrative data. I am a gastroenterologist pursing my career goal of becoming an independently funded investigator in IBD, with a specific focus on the development of patient-provider communication tools to improve CRC outcomes. To achieve my career goals, I will require protected time, mentorship, and formal research training in qualitative methods, comparative effectiveness analyses, patient engagement, and development of communication tools. With the support and protected time from the AHRQ PCOR K08 Award, I will be able to complete my proposed research and career training goals and secure independent funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are rising in the U.S., and patients with IBD are at an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. This project compares strategies using colonoscopy to reduce or prevent colorectal cancer among patients with IBD and investigates how patients' past experiences with colonoscopy influence their decision to have future colonoscopies. Development of a communication tool that can improve how patients understand their personal risks of colorectal cancer that their ability to make informed decisions could have a substantial public health impact.",Patient-Centered Comparative Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Surveillance in IBD,9741689,K08HS024122,[' '],AHRQ,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K08,2019,152580,0.04158956742332528
"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9827920,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Undifferentiated', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale simulation', 'recruit', 'social learning', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2019,260395,0.019934000857589843

"Deep radiomic decision support system for colorectal cancer Project Summary/Abstract Computer-aided detection (CADe) has been shown to increase readers’ sensitivity and reduce inter-observer variance in detecting abnormalities in medical images. However, they prompt relatively large numbers of false positives (FPs) that readers find tedious to review and, during this process, the readers can incorrectly dismiss true lesions prompted correctly to them by CADe systems. Thus, there is a demand for an advanced decision support system that would provide not only high detection sensitivity, but also high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a lesion. In this project, we propose to improve the detection specificity of CADe by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that can analyze the extrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the context of local anatomy, of target lesions, whereas current CADe systems consider only the intrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the shape and texture of detected lesions. Further, we can use DCNNs to provide an explanation of why a specific location was prompted by using anatomically meaningful object categories with similar-image retrieval of past diagnosed cases. In this project, we will focus on computed tomographic colonography (CTC), which is a minimally invasive screening method for early detection of colorectal lesions to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC), which is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Historically, however, only adenomas were believed to be precursors of CRC. Recent studies have revealed a molecular pathway where also serrated lesions can develop into CRC. Recent studies have indicated that CTC can detect serrated lesions accurately based upon the phenomenon called contrast coating. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop a deep radiomic decision support (DeepDES) system that leverages deep learning for providing high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of colorectal lesions, in particular, serrated lesions, and for providing diagnostic information that explains why a specific location was prompted as a lesion to assist readers in assessing detected lesions correctly. To achieve the goal, we will explore the following specific aims: (1) Develop a radiomic deep-learning (RAID) scheme for the detection of colorectal lesions, (2) develop a DeepDES system for diagnosis of detected lesions, and (3) evaluate the clinical benefit of DeepDES system. Successful development of the proposed DeepDES system will provide an advanced decision support that addresses the current concerns about CADe by yielding both high detection sensitivity and high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a target lesion. Broad adoption and use of the DeepDES system will advance the prevention and early diagnosis of cancer, and thus will ultimately reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in the United States.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Adapting the Berkeley Big Data Analytics Stack to Genomics and Health Project Summary We propose building a computational platform based on the high performance Berkeley Big Data Analytics Stack (BDAS) to support a new ecosystem of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) applications. This platform will make it faster, easier, and less expensive to develop molecular Clinical Decision Support Systems. These systems require real-time queries of globally distributed data, efficient machine learning on large genomic datasets, and must be secure, fault-tolerant and scalable. BDAS and associated technologies are designed to help us meet these challenges and are therefore ideal building blocks to help us create our computational platform. To encourage the adoption of standards for the querying and sharing of large genomic datasets, we will adapt the BDAS stack to support the standards of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). Project Narrative Funding this work will help establish a production quality FOSS implementation of the important Global Alliance for Genomics and Health standards.

"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9640372,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'effectiveness research', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,347584,0.03412528619414915
"Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making Project Summary This project will use methods from quantitative anthropology to describe the social space of vaccine beliefs that circulate among the general public and to provide an initial assessment of how different belief variations influence decisions to vaccinate. The results will establish, for the first time, the patterns of co-variation in the wide variety of pro- and anti- vaccine beliefs, and which axes of this variation appear associated with decisions to vaccinate. Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but the lay public largely does not fully appreciate scientific evidence when making decisions for or against vaccination. Understanding the inter-correlations of these beliefs, therefore, is imperative for designing effective educational interventions that can directly interface with the cultural beliefs that surround vaccination and influence the public's decision making on this issue. The project will leverage insights from two very different but complementary data sources: responses to a nationally representative survey (fielded on the RAND American Life Panel) and social media data from Twitter. Our analytic approach will begin with systematic coding techniques from mixed-methods research to classify vaccine beliefs into a comprehensive set of belief variants. Manual coding will be validated through inter-observer reliability checks and replicated at scale with machine-learning algorithms. Having systematically coded the data, we will then assess whether nationally representative survey data and data mined from Twitter produce similar results using Cultural Consensus Analysis, a technique from quantitative cultural anthropology. From the survey data we will test whether vaccine beliefs are correlated with decisions to vaccinate after controlling for demographic attributes. To ensure completion of this innovative and methodologically expansive project, the project team combines expertise from anthropology, decision science, clinical medicine, and biomathematics. The principal investigator brings to this project multiple years of both academic and industry experience in statistical modelling of cultural data. Project Narrative Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but patients' vaccination decisions may be more influenced by broadly circulated cultural beliefs than they are influenced by scientific evidence. This proposed research will systematically map the diversity of the publics' vaccination beliefs, assess how these beliefs influence vaccination decisions, and advise policy makers how to interface more directly with these popular belief systems that are critical to effective vaccination efforts.",Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making,9557573,R21HD087749,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anthropology', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Belief System', 'Childhood', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Cultural Anthropology', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fright', 'General Population', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Work', 'authority', 'biomathematics', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'prevent', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social space', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'vaccine safety']",NICHD,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2018,242266,0.05223103694126111
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies.

"CORA_TM_A Personalized Cardiac Counselor for Optimal Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project aims to introduce a clinical decision support system, CORA (Cardiac Outcomes Risk Assessment) for advanced heart failure (HF) a devastating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions. The project specifically aims to moderate the deployment ventricular assist devices (VADs) which have been recently approved as destination (DT) such that patients most likely to benefit will be prioritized, while those better served with palliative care will be spare from unnecessary risks of debilitating side effects. The proposed system will leverage proven prognostic models based on advanced data mining and machine learning algorithms, and be packaged as a user-friendly computer application that would be used at key decision points in the course of treatment. It would provide both physician and patient with prognostic assessment based on the fusion of: patient-specific data, expert knowledge, and retrospective meta-analysis. This four-year project will develop a multi-platform software application that integrates modules for: forecasting, decision support, communication, decision making and visualization of data. This will be achieved through completion of four specific aims: (SA1) Expand existing inference (prognostic) algorithms and develop expert decision models to compute personalized estimate of life expectancy and risk of adverse events; (SA2) Create a computer application to assist patients to navigate their treatment options as they reflect their personal preferences and beliefs; (SA3) Incorporate these prognostic and decision models into user-friendly user interfaces for physicians, patients and their family caregivers; and (SA4) Conduct a multi- center study with respect to both qualitative and quantitative metrics of efficacy related to mortality, morbidity and quality of life. Training data capitalizing upon the NIH-funded Interagency Registry for Mechanical Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) as well as recently published guidance documents by the American Heart Association (AHA) and International Society of Heart & Lung Transplantation (ISHLT.) This project will involve a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: bioengineering, advanced heart failure cardiology, cardiac surgery, computer science (machine learning/data mining), medical ethics, and palliative care. Carnegie Mellon University, one of the Nation's leading institutions for Computer Science will coordinate this project to assure a productive collaboration with four clinical sites: Allegheny Health Network (Pittsburgh), U. Colorado Denver, Duke University, and Harvard/Brigham & Women's hospital. By achieve consensus amongst stakeholders, we hope to assure the acceptance of CORA into practice and ultimately improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of the treatment of end-stage heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a debilitating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions. Treatment can be very complicated, and for some, may involve advanced technologies like heart-assist devices and stents, and for others palliative care. This project will develop a software application for patients and their doctors to work together in choosing the best treatment strategy.",CORA_TM_A Personalized Cardiac Counselor for Optimal Therapy,9675403,R01HL122639,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adverse effects', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'American Heart Association', 'Anxiety', 'Attitude', 'Belief', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiology', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregiver support', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collaborations', 'Colorado', 'Communication', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consensus', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Dependence', 'Destinations', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart failure', 'Heart-Assist Devices', 'Heart-Lung Transplantation', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Implant', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Institution', 'Intention', 'Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Ethics', 'Medicare', 'Mental Depression', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Outcome', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Savings', 'Societies', 'Stents', 'Stress', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical research site', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost effectiveness', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'design', 'discount', 'experience', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interactive tool', 'left ventricular assist device', 'literacy', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'non-compliance', 'optimal treatments', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'readmission rates', 'satisfaction', 'shared decision making', 'technology validation', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly', 'ventricular assist device', 'willingness']",NHLBI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,814575,0.04789790637648525
"Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes Summary The objective of this proposal is to optimize the design and evaluate a robust artificial pancreas (R-AP) system for use in patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (T1D) with HbA1C greater than 8% and compare HbA1C outcomes in these patients relative to a decision support system that utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Although high risk patients have possibly the most to gain from usage of AP technology, they are oftentimes under-represented or excluded from clinical trials. This has been because of the increased risk of failure of these AP systems that were not designed to handle inconsistent reporting of meals, variable activity level, and infusion set failures. An AP system for high risk patients needs to be designed to achieve maximal benefit, including reducing the risk of acute and chronic complications. A major obstacle for enabling the AP for usage by high-risk patients is that these patients may be less compliant with use guidelines for the system including missed meal announcements, infrequent sensor calibrations, and prolonged infusion set wear leading to infusion set failures. In this grant, we will integrate new risk-mitigation features into the OHSU single-hormone AP to enable usage by high-risk patients that fall into the categories described above. We present new algorithms for automating the detection of missed meal announcements, missed calibrations, and robust handling of hybrid usage mode. While AP systems may be an optimal choice for improving glycemic control, many people with T1D prefer MDI therapy. Decision support systems such as the DailyDose decision support system developed at OHSU can be used to improve glycemic control for patients who prefer MDI therapy. The DailyDose decision support system is designed for CGM augmented MDI therapy. It enables on-demand calculation of insulin doses, automates insulin dose adjustments based on pattern recognition, and uses machine learning approaches to alert the patients to events such as predicted hypoglycemia and missed meal doses.The benefit of the DailyDose system is that it is a simple system and does not require use of an insulin pump, which may be a challenge for some patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes as pump therapy is more intensive and requires infusion set changes. It is unknown in this high risk group of people whether patient needs, quality of life, and glycemic control are best addressed with an AP system or decision support tool or if both treatments are appropriate. We have designed a 3-month clinical study to compare glycemic outcomes during AP vs. decision support interventions in a high- risk T1D cohort (HbA1C 8-10.5%), with the aim of demonstrating a significant clinically relevant reduction in HbA1C. Our hypothesis is that both AP and decision support therapies will decrease HbA1C relative to baseline but that the AP will provide further benefit over DailyDose. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. We propose to integrate features into the OHSU artificial pancreas to optimize it for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c>8-10.5%) and compare it to DailyDose, a decision support system that uses multiple daily injections.",Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes,9691740,R01DK120367,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Carbohydrates', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Distress', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modification', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'arm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'design', 'engineering design', 'expectation', 'falls', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'patient population', 'primary outcome', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'risk mitigation', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'support tools']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,591323,0.04521719025692357
"TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS PROJECT SUMMARY With an associated mortality of 35%, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) contributes to the morbidity and mortality seen in many acute conditions such as pneumonia, influenza, sepsis, trauma and aspiration. Yet studies consistently show that ARDS is under-recognized in up to 40% of patients with generally low and variable adoption of practices shown to improve mortality in ARDS. The overall goal of this proposed project is to improve care delivered to ARDS patients by promoting accurate identification of patients with ARDS and increasing adoption of evidence-based interventions shown to improve outcomes in ARDS. With the recent publication of a multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS, this proposal specifically aims: 1) To increase identification of ARDS patients with an automated electronic tool (ARDS Sniffer 2.0) powered by the predictive analytics of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing. 2) To translate the recently published multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS into an evidence-based, context-appropriate, Electronic Clinical decision support system in ARDS (ECARDS) for the management of ARDS. This process will be informed by an expert panel from the CPG committee as well as a semi-qualitative analysis of the cognitive decision making process, data needs and workflow of users in a series of Think-Aloud studies and focus group interviews. ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ECARDS and an ARDS Dashboard to show near real-time data on the incidence of ARDS and rate of utilization of best care will then be incorporated within the hospital EMR for useability testing with another series of Think-Aloud and semi-qualitative studies. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ARDS Dashboard, and ECARDS in a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized control trial of 3 hospitals within the Montefiore Healthcare System to increase utilization of recommended interventions in ARDS and improve outcomes. 4) To promote the dissemination of the clinical decision support system through our partner professional organizations of American Thoracic Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and American Association of Respiratory Care and Program for Emergency Preparedness. Because of the high pressure, high acuity, and rapidly changing status of the acutely ill ARDS patient, clinical decision making often defaults to the automated, pattern-driven cognitive processes which are particularly prone to unconscious biases and errors and cognitive overload from large volumes of shifting data. As such, this proposal is the ideal research demonstration project to develop a new clinical decision support tool that will harness the power of big data and predictive analytics to identify ARDS in the hospital and deliver an evidenced-based, expert and user informed clinical decision support tool to clinicians at the right point during their clinical interaction and workflow with these patients in order to promote the right interventions to the right patients at the right time. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome constitutes the most severe form of respiratory failure in the hospital with an associated mortality of 35%, it is consistently under-recognized and proven treatments are underutilized. This proposal aims to harness the power of big data in the hospital information system to identify patients with ARDS and prompt clinicians with the evidence-based best management of this condition. By developing a computerized decision support system whose design is informed by the experts and the clinicians themselves, this proposal aims to bring the right care to the right patient at the right time to save lives and promote recovery from this devastating condition.",TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS,9571335,R18HS026188,[' '],AHRQ,"ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, INC",R18,2018,397326,0.07049516633828574
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9537252,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,178606,0.10551310028761554
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function.

"Patient-Centered Comparative Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Surveillance in IBD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Surveillance colonoscopy decreases the risk of developing CRC and increases the detection of CRC at an early stage. However, only a small proportion of eligible patients with IBD engage in surveillance colonoscopy as recommended by current practice guidelines. There is a need to identify effective approaches to surveillance colonoscopy and how to effectively communicate individualized CRC risk to IBD patients in order to reduce the mortality burden of this fatal IBD complication. My long-term goal is to conduct and implement research to reduce the incidence and mortality of IBD-associated CRC. My central hypotheses are that patient experiences influence acceptance of CRC surveillance colonoscopy, subgroups of IBD patients benefit from surveillance colonoscopy, and that a patient-centered communication tool using these factors can aid patient decision making regarding CRC surveillance. The specific aims of my proposal are: Aim 1: Define IBD patient experiences throughout the process of surveillance colonoscopy. Aim 2(a): Compare the effectiveness of colonoscopy surveillance strategies on the yield of dysplasia or CRC, CRC stage, treatment, and CRC-related mortality in a national cohort of patients with IBD. Aim 2(b): Identify subgroups of patients with IBD who derive benefit (or harm) from surveillance colonoscopy. Aim 3: Translate patient experiences of colonoscopy and effectiveness of surveillance colonoscopy effectiveness into an IBD CRC communication tool for decision support. Future studies will test the effectiveness of the communication tool on CRC surveillance adherence, early stage CRC detection, and patient satisfaction with decision making. I will achieve these aims through a partnership with the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America to conduct in-depth interviews with patients with IBD regarding their experiences with colonoscopy and to conduct patient consensus panels to develop and refine a communication tool for CRC surveillance decision making. I will compare the effectiveness of colonoscopy surveillance strategies on outcomes of CRC in a cohort of approximately 63,000 patients with IBD in the national Veterans Health Administration datasets aided by natural language processing to define key IBD variables currently lacking using automated administrative data. I am a gastroenterologist pursing my career goal of becoming an independently funded investigator in IBD, with a specific focus on the development of patient-provider communication tools to improve CRC outcomes. To achieve my career goals, I will require protected time, mentorship, and formal research training in qualitative methods, comparative effectiveness analyses, patient engagement, and development of communication tools. With the support and protected time from the AHRQ PCOR K08 Award, I will be able to complete my proposed research and career training goals and secure independent funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are rising in the U.S., and patients with IBD are at an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. This project compares strategies using colonoscopy to reduce or prevent colorectal cancer among patients with IBD and investigates how patients' past experiences with colonoscopy influence their decision to have future colonoscopies. Development of a communication tool that can improve how patients understand their personal risks of colorectal cancer that their ability to make informed decisions could have a substantial public health impact.",Patient-Centered Comparative Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Surveillance in IBD,9536657,K08HS024122,[' '],AHRQ,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K08,2018,153360,0.04158956742332528

"Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Patient Level Decision Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Organ Acceptance Decision Making Only 15,652 of nearly 109,000 waitlisted patients for kidney transplant (KT) received one in 2014. More than six thousand died while waiting for a KT and more than two thousand became too sick to be transplanted. Patient survival, quality of life, and morbidity is significantly worse for those who remain on dialysis. The majority of kidneys that are transplanted are recovered from deceased donors. In 2014, while 12,664 kidneys were recovered for KT, 2,272 were discarded - most frequently due to being of marginal or low quality. Many of the discarded kidneys are believed to confer smaller survival gains than other procured kidneys. Previous studies show that the marginal kidneys offer survival benefits with respect to remaining on dialysis, but neglect quantification of these benefits to an individual patient. These studies ignore two major issues: (i) the low c-statistics of one and three year post-transplant patient and graft survival models; and (ii) dynamics of the organ offers and the current point based priority system for the waitlisted patients. Given these facts, from a decision maker's perspective, accepting or rejecting a low quality organ is not necessarily a well informed choice.  The proposed research takes a comprehensive approach in developing a survival model incorporating time on dialysis, recipient characteristics, transplant center characteristics, and donated kidney characteristics. It proposes to apply techniques from biostatistics and machine learning to improve model accuracy. The research further aims to quantify the dynamics of kidney availability of different quality organs, and model future kidney offers as a stochastic decision tree. The proposed computational engine for estimating the survival benefits of accepting or rejecting an offer will be transformative in clinical decision making. Moreover, th successful completion of the proposed research will provide a highly reliable approach to support kidney acceptance/rejection decisions. The research will be carried out by a trans- disciplinary team with expert knowledge in the transplant allocation system, decision methodologies, and clinical decision making. The research team will incorporate input from an external advisory board consisting of leaders and key stakeholders in kidney and pancreas transplant programs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The transplantation system in the United States discards hundreds of recovered kidneys annually. Many of the discarded kidneys are of marginal quality and are believed to confer smaller survival gains than other procured kidneys. The proposed research will take a comprehensive approach to accurately quantify patient survival and implications of accepting a kidney towards developing a decision support engine.

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,9256441,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Mass in breast', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive of treatment response', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2017,548074,0.004316765109471355
"Autonomous system supporting patient-specific transfer and discharge decisions Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to improve the utility of AutoTriage, a machine-learning based clinical decision support (CDS) system, by integrating clinician intervention medical information into its predictions. Despite identified needs for CDS systems in patient transfer and discharge decisions, existing tools do not meet high standards for sensitivity and specificity. This is because current CDS methods are unable to distinguish changes in patient health due to clinician intervention from those arising due to an internal homeostatic mechanism. Thus, for example, existing tools may erroneously suggest discharge for a patient currently undergoing a life-sustaining treatment. Research Question: Can machine learning principles be used to create a classifier which incorporates signs of clinical intervention to inform transfer and discharge decision support, ultimately leading to higher quality predictions? In addition, will such a tool be able to maintain its performance when tested on a different patient population or one for which the data quality is much poorer? Prior Work: We have developed AutoTriage, a machine learning-based CDSS for 12-hour mortality prediction. On the publicly available MIMIC-III retrospective data set, this system attains an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88, which is superior to commonly used triage scores MEWS (AUROC = 0.75), SOFA (0.71), and SAPS-II (0.72) on the same data set. Specific Aims: To integrate clinician intervention information into existing AutoTriage software (Aim 1), and to test the robustness of this modified tool to changes in patient population and data quality (Aim 2). Methods: We will create gold standards for periods of clinician intervention, using chart events and keywords from clinician notes. Then, we will train a binary classifier for identifying these periods and, ultimately, use the classifier to modify AutoTriage scores. Robustness studies will be performed on the retrospective UC ReX and sparse MIMIC III databases. Successful completion of Aim 1will be demonstrated if 75% of all hours of clinician intervention are correctly classified, if the test-set area under the ROC curve improves by 5% over its current value, and if 30-day readmission predictions are 10% more accurate for patients treated within the last hour. Aim 2 will be completed if AutoTriage ROC area performance is within ± 0.10 of its original value for both UC ReX and sparse MIMIC III sets. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the AutoTriage system will be deployed at the sites of our ongoing clinical implementations. During this study, we project that AutoTriage will assess mortality risk for 25,000 ICU patients per year, helping clinicians more effectively allocate interventions totaling $15 million. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems aid medical professionals by presenting them with information needed to make better decisions about patient care, often in the form of alerts. To be of practical benefit, CDS tools must provide recommendations which accurately reflect the ongoing treatment provided by the clinician. We propose to incorporate knowledge of a clinician’s actions, like the administration of fluids or of antibiotics, into a CDS tool in order to improve the assessment of a patient’s ability to be discharged or transferred safely.",Autonomous system supporting patient-specific transfer and discharge decisions,9256278,R43NR015945,"['Address', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Computer software', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deterioration', 'Event', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Homeostasis', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Transfer', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'ROC Curve', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'high standard', 'improved', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend']",NINR,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2017,347772,0.032472155292871153
"Adapting the Berkeley Big Data Analytics Stack to Genomics and Health Project Summary We propose building a computational platform based on the high performance Berkeley Big Data Analytics Stack (BDAS) to support a new ecosystem of Clinical Decision Support (CDS) applications. This platform will make it faster, easier, and less expensive to develop molecular Clinical Decision Support Systems. These systems require real-time queries of globally distributed data, efficient machine learning on large genomic datasets, and must be secure, fault-tolerant and scalable. BDAS and associated technologies are designed to help us meet these challenges and are therefore ideal building blocks to help us create our computational platform. To encourage the adoption of standards for the querying and sharing of large genomic datasets, we will adapt the BDAS stack to support the standards of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH). Project Narrative Funding this work will help establish a production quality FOSS implementation of the important Global Alliance for Genomics and Health standards.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"Deep radiomic decision support system for colorectal cancer Project Summary/Abstract Computer-aided detection (CADe) has been shown to increase readers’ sensitivity and reduce inter-observer variance in detecting abnormalities in medical images. However, they prompt relatively large numbers of false positives (FPs) that readers find tedious to review and, during this process, the readers can incorrectly dismiss true lesions prompted correctly to them by CADe systems. Thus, there is a demand for an advanced decision support system that would provide not only high detection sensitivity, but also high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a lesion. In this project, we propose to improve the detection specificity of CADe by deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) that can analyze the extrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the context of local anatomy, of target lesions, whereas current CADe systems consider only the intrinsic radiomic phenotype, such as the shape and texture of detected lesions. Further, we can use DCNNs to provide an explanation of why a specific location was prompted by using anatomically meaningful object categories with similar-image retrieval of past diagnosed cases. In this project, we will focus on computed tomographic colonography (CTC), which is a minimally invasive screening method for early detection of colorectal lesions to prevent colorectal cancer (CRC), which is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Historically, however, only adenomas were believed to be precursors of CRC. Recent studies have revealed a molecular pathway where also serrated lesions can develop into CRC. Recent studies have indicated that CTC can detect serrated lesions accurately based upon the phenomenon called contrast coating. Thus, the goal of this project is to develop a deep radiomic decision support (DeepDES) system that leverages deep learning for providing high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of colorectal lesions, in particular, serrated lesions, and for providing diagnostic information that explains why a specific location was prompted as a lesion to assist readers in assessing detected lesions correctly. To achieve the goal, we will explore the following specific aims: (1) Develop a radiomic deep-learning (RAID) scheme for the detection of colorectal lesions, (2) develop a DeepDES system for diagnosis of detected lesions, and (3) evaluate the clinical benefit of DeepDES system. Successful development of the proposed DeepDES system will provide an advanced decision support that addresses the current concerns about CADe by yielding both high detection sensitivity and high specificity while being able to explain why a specific location was prompted as a target lesion. Broad adoption and use of the DeepDES system will advance the prevention and early diagnosis of cancer, and thus will ultimately reduce mortality from colorectal cancer in the United States.

"Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making Project Summary This project will use methods from quantitative anthropology to describe the social space of vaccine beliefs that circulate among the general public and to provide an initial assessment of how different belief variations influence decisions to vaccinate. The results will establish, for the first time, the patterns of co-variation in the wide variety of pro- and anti- vaccine beliefs, and which axes of this variation appear associated with decisions to vaccinate. Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but the lay public largely does not fully appreciate scientific evidence when making decisions for or against vaccination. Understanding the inter-correlations of these beliefs, therefore, is imperative for designing effective educational interventions that can directly interface with the cultural beliefs that surround vaccination and influence the public's decision making on this issue. The project will leverage insights from two very different but complementary data sources: responses to a nationally representative survey (fielded on the RAND American Life Panel) and social media data from Twitter. Our analytic approach will begin with systematic coding techniques from mixed-methods research to classify vaccine beliefs into a comprehensive set of belief variants. Manual coding will be validated through inter-observer reliability checks and replicated at scale with machine-learning algorithms. Having systematically coded the data, we will then assess whether nationally representative survey data and data mined from Twitter produce similar results using Cultural Consensus Analysis, a technique from quantitative cultural anthropology. From the survey data we will test whether vaccine beliefs are correlated with decisions to vaccinate after controlling for demographic attributes. To ensure completion of this innovative and methodologically expansive project, the project team combines expertise from anthropology, decision science, clinical medicine, and biomathematics. The principal investigator brings to this project multiple years of both academic and industry experience in statistical modelling of cultural data. Project Narrative Vaccination is a key public health defense against infectious disease, but patients' vaccination decisions may be more influenced by broadly circulated cultural beliefs than they are influenced by scientific evidence. This proposed research will systematically map the diversity of the publics' vaccination beliefs, assess how these beliefs influence vaccination decisions, and advise policy makers how to interface more directly with these popular belief systems that are critical to effective vaccination efforts.",Vaccine Beliefs and Decision Making,9241259,R21HD087749,"['Achievement', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anthropology', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Belief System', 'Childhood', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Cultural Anthropology', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Educational Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fright', 'General Population', 'Health Communication', 'Health behavior', 'Immunization', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measles', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Vaccinated', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccines', 'Variant', 'Work', 'authority', 'biomathematics', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'prevent', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social space', 'theories', 'therapy design', 'vaccine safety']",NICHD,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2017,239723,0.05223103694126111
"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies. Our continued studies seek to develop and validate a decision support tool for predicting survival in PAH, which will allow the scientific community and eventually patients a means to choose appropriate specific therapies based on individual risks and patient choices in order to improve survival and quality of life for our patients.",PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension,9207492,R01HL134673,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Caring', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Equation', 'Evolution', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intention', 'Intervention', 'Investigational Drugs', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Pulmonary Hypertension', 'Pulmonary Vascular Resistance', 'Pulmonary vessels', 'Quality of life', 'Rare Diseases', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Uncertainty', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data modeling', 'effective therapy', 'hypertension treatment', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'response', 'shared decision making', 'success', 'support tools', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'time use', 'tool', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'user-friendly', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,ALLEGHENY-SINGER RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749226,0.06436297171417231
"CORA_TM_A Personalized Cardiac Counselor for Optimal Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project aims to introduce a clinical decision support system, CORA (Cardiac Outcomes Risk Assessment) for advanced heart failure (HF) a devastating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions. The project specifically aims to moderate the deployment ventricular assist devices (VADs) which have been recently approved as destination (DT) such that patients most likely to benefit will be prioritized, while those better served with palliative care will be spare from unnecessary risks of debilitating side effects. The proposed system will leverage proven prognostic models based on advanced data mining and machine learning algorithms, and be packaged as a user-friendly computer application that would be used at key decision points in the course of treatment. It would provide both physician and patient with prognostic assessment based on the fusion of: patient-specific data, expert knowledge, and retrospective meta-analysis. This four-year project will develop a multi-platform software application that integrates modules for: forecasting, decision support, communication, decision making and visualization of data. This will be achieved through completion of four specific aims: (SA1) Expand existing inference (prognostic) algorithms and develop expert decision models to compute personalized estimate of life expectancy and risk of adverse events; (SA2) Create a computer application to assist patients to navigate their treatment options as they reflect their personal preferences and beliefs; (SA3) Incorporate these prognostic and decision models into user-friendly user interfaces for physicians, patients and their family caregivers; and (SA4) Conduct a multi- center study with respect to both qualitative and quantitative metrics of efficacy related to mortality, morbidity and quality of life. Training data capitalizing upon the NIH-funded Interagency Registry for Mechanical Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) as well as recently published guidance documents by the American Heart Association (AHA) and International Society of Heart & Lung Transplantation (ISHLT.) This project will involve a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: bioengineering, advanced heart failure cardiology, cardiac surgery, computer science (machine learning/data mining), medical ethics, and palliative care. Carnegie Mellon University, one of the Nation's leading institutions for Computer Science will coordinate this project to assure a productive collaboration with four clinical sites: Allegheny Health Network (Pittsburgh), U. Colorado Denver, Duke University, and Harvard/Brigham & Women's hospital. By achieve consensus amongst stakeholders, we hope to assure the acceptance of CORA into practice and ultimately improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of the treatment of end-stage heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a debilitating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions.

"Predicting Appropriate Admission of Bronchiolitis Patients in the Emergency Room Abstract  Bronchiolitis is the most common illness leading to hospitalization in young children. For children under age two, bronchiolitis incurs an annual total inpatient cost of $1.73 billion. Each year in the U.S., 287,000 emergency department (ED) visits occur because of bronchiolitis, with a hospital admission rate of 32-40%. Due to a lack of evidence and objective criteria for managing bronchiolitis, ED disposition decisions (hospital admission or discharge to home) are often made subjectively resulting in significant practice variation. Studies reviewing admission need suggest that up to 29% of admissions from the ED are unnecessary. About 6% of ED discharges for bronchiolitis result in ED returns with admission. These inappropriate dispositions waste limited healthcare resources, increase patient and parental distress, expose patients to iatrogenic risks, and worsen outcomes.  Clinical guidelines are designed to reduce practice variation and improve clinicians’ decision making. Existing guidelines for bronchiolitis offer limited improvement in patient outcomes. Methodological shortcomings include that the guidelines provide no specific thresholds for ED decisions to admit or to discharge, have an insufficient level of detail, and do not account for differences in patient and illness characteristics including co-morbidities.  Predictive models are frequently used to complement clinical guidelines, reduce practice variation, and improve clinicians’ decision making. Used in real time, predictive models can present objective criteria supported by historical data for an individualized disease management plan and guide admission decisions. However, existing predictive models for bronchiolitis patients in the ED have limitations, including low accuracy and the assumption that the actual ED disposition decision was appropriate. To date, no operational definition of appropriate admission exists. No model has been built based on appropriate admissions, which include both actual admissions that were necessary and actual ED discharges that were unsafe.  To fill the gap, the proposed project will: (1) Develop an operational definition of appropriate hospital admission for bronchiolitis patients in the ED. (2) Develop and test the accuracy of a new model to predict appropriate hospital admission for a bronchiolitis patient in the ED. (3) Conduct simulations to estimate the impact of using the model on bronchiolitis outcomes. The project will produce a new predictive model that can be operationalized to guide and improve disposition decisions for bronchiolitis patients in the ED. Broad use of the model would reduce iatrogenic risk, patient and parental distress, healthcare use, and costs and improve outcomes for bronchiolitis patients. If the model proves to be accurate and associated with improved outcomes, future study will test the impact of using it in a randomized controlled trial following its implementation into an existing electronic medical record to facilitate real-time decision making. Each year, many young children present to the emergency department (ED) because of bronchiolitis, but are inappropriately disposed. The new predictive model will standardize hospital admission practice and guide and improve disposition decisions for bronchiolitis patients in the ED. Broad use of the model will reduce ED returns, hospital admissions, and costs and increase safe discharges.",Predicting Appropriate Admission of Bronchiolitis Patients in the Emergency Room,9328146,R21HL128875,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Admission activity', 'Adverse event', 'Age', 'Bronchiolitis', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Comorbidity', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease Management', 'Distress', 'Emergency Department evaluation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Length', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Risk', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'hospital admission rate', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'wasting']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2017,129668,0.018058614003809672
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9325317,K01ES026837,"['Accreditation', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Caring', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'multidisciplinary', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'routine practice', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,178606,0.10551310028761554
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9308020,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2017,492125,0.06579016453843936
"Patient-Centered Comparative Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Surveillance in IBD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Surveillance colonoscopy decreases the risk of developing CRC and increases the detection of CRC at an early stage. However, only a small proportion of eligible patients with IBD engage in surveillance colonoscopy as recommended by current practice guidelines. There is a need to identify effective approaches to surveillance colonoscopy and how to effectively communicate individualized CRC risk to IBD patients in order to reduce the mortality burden of this fatal IBD complication. My long-term goal is to conduct and implement research to reduce the incidence and mortality of IBD-associated CRC. My central hypotheses are that patient experiences influence acceptance of CRC surveillance colonoscopy, subgroups of IBD patients benefit from surveillance colonoscopy, and that a patient-centered communication tool using these factors can aid patient decision making regarding CRC surveillance. The specific aims of my proposal are: Aim 1: Define IBD patient experiences throughout the process of surveillance colonoscopy. Aim 2(a): Compare the effectiveness of colonoscopy surveillance strategies on the yield of dysplasia or CRC, CRC stage, treatment, and CRC-related mortality in a national cohort of patients with IBD. Aim 2(b): Identify subgroups of patients with IBD who derive benefit (or harm) from surveillance colonoscopy. Aim 3: Translate patient experiences of colonoscopy and effectiveness of surveillance colonoscopy effectiveness into an IBD CRC communication tool for decision support. Future studies will test the effectiveness of the communication tool on CRC surveillance adherence, early stage CRC detection, and patient satisfaction with decision making. I will achieve these aims through a partnership with the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America to conduct in-depth interviews with patients with IBD regarding their experiences with colonoscopy and to conduct patient consensus panels to develop and refine a communication tool for CRC surveillance decision making. I will compare the effectiveness of colonoscopy surveillance strategies on outcomes of CRC in a cohort of approximately 63,000 patients with IBD in the national Veterans Health Administration datasets aided by natural language processing to define key IBD variables currently lacking using automated administrative data. I am a gastroenterologist pursing my career goal of becoming an independently funded investigator in IBD, with a specific focus on the development of patient-provider communication tools to improve CRC outcomes. To achieve my career goals, I will require protected time, mentorship, and formal research training in qualitative methods, comparative effectiveness analyses, patient engagement, and development of communication tools. With the support and protected time from the AHRQ PCOR K08 Award, I will be able to complete my proposed research and career training goals and secure independent funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are rising in the U.S., and patients with IBD are at an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. This project compares strategies using colonoscopy to reduce or prevent colorectal cancer among patients with IBD and investigates how patients' past experiences with colonoscopy influence their decision to have future colonoscopies. Development of a communication tool that can improve how patients understand their personal risks of colorectal cancer that their ability to make informed decisions could have a substantial public health impact.",Patient-Centered Comparative Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Surveillance in IBD,9322302,K08HS024122,[' '],AHRQ,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K08,2017,153360,0.04158956742332528
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Patient Level Decision Making ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Promoting Utilization of Kidneys by Improving Organ Acceptance Decision Making Only 15,652 of nearly 109,000 waitlisted patients for kidney transplant (KT) received one in 2014. More than six thousand died while waiting for a KT and more than two thousand became too sick to be transplanted. Patient survival, quality of life, and morbidity is significantly worse for those who remain on dialysis. The majority of kidneys that are transplanted are recovered from deceased donors. In 2014, while 12,664 kidneys were recovered for KT, 2,272 were discarded - most frequently due to being of marginal or low quality. Many of the discarded kidneys are believed to confer smaller survival gains than other procured kidneys. Previous studies show that the marginal kidneys offer survival benefits with respect to remaining on dialysis, but neglect quantification of these benefits to an individual patient. These studies ignore two major issues: (i) the low c-statistics of one and three year post-transplant patient and graft survival models; and (ii) dynamics of the organ offers and the current point based priority system for the waitlisted patients. Given these facts, from a decision maker's perspective, accepting or rejecting a low quality organ is not necessarily a well informed choice.  The proposed research takes a comprehensive approach in developing a survival model incorporating time on dialysis, recipient characteristics, transplant center characteristics, and donated kidney characteristics. It proposes to apply techniques from biostatistics and machine learning to improve model accuracy. The research further aims to quantify the dynamics of kidney availability of different quality organs, and model future kidney offers as a stochastic decision tree. The proposed computational engine for estimating the survival benefits of accepting or rejecting an offer will be transformative in clinical decision making. Moreover, th successful completion of the proposed research will provide a highly reliable approach to support kidney acceptance/rejection decisions. The research will be carried out by a trans- disciplinary team with expert knowledge in the transplant allocation system, decision methodologies, and clinical decision making. The research team will incorporate input from an external advisory board consisting of leaders and key stakeholders in kidney and pancreas transplant programs.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The transplantation system in the United States discards hundreds of recovered kidneys annually.

"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,9067256,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Mass in breast', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'immunohistochemical markers', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2016,549985,0.004316765109471355
"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"CORA_TM_A Personalized Cardiac Counselor for Optimal Therapy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project aims to introduce a clinical decision support system, CORA (Cardiac Outcomes Risk Assessment) for advanced heart failure (HF) a devastating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions. The project specifically aims to moderate the deployment ventricular assist devices (VADs) which have been recently approved as destination (DT) such that patients most likely to benefit will be prioritized, while those better served with palliative care will be spare from unnecessary risks of debilitating side effects. The proposed system will leverage proven prognostic models based on advanced data mining and machine learning algorithms, and be packaged as a user-friendly computer application that would be used at key decision points in the course of treatment. It would provide both physician and patient with prognostic assessment based on the fusion of: patient-specific data, expert knowledge, and retrospective meta-analysis. This four-year project will develop a multi-platform software application that integrates modules for: forecasting, decision support, communication, decision making and visualization of data. This will be achieved through completion of four specific aims: (SA1) Expand existing inference (prognostic) algorithms and develop expert decision models to compute personalized estimate of life expectancy and risk of adverse events; (SA2) Create a computer application to assist patients to navigate their treatment options as they reflect their personal preferences and beliefs; (SA3) Incorporate these prognostic and decision models into user-friendly user interfaces for physicians, patients and their family caregivers; and (SA4) Conduct a multi- center study with respect to both qualitative and quantitative metrics of efficacy related to mortality, morbidity and quality of life. Training data capitalizing upon the NIH-funded Interagency Registry for Mechanical Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) as well as recently published guidance documents by the American Heart Association (AHA) and International Society of Heart & Lung Transplantation (ISHLT.) This project will involve a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: bioengineering, advanced heart failure cardiology, cardiac surgery, computer science (machine learning/data mining), medical ethics, and palliative care. Carnegie Mellon University, one of the Nation's leading institutions for Computer Science will coordinate this project to assure a productive collaboration with four clinical sites: Allegheny Health Network (Pittsburgh), U. Colorado Denver, Duke University, and Harvard/Brigham & Women's hospital. By achieve consensus amongst stakeholders, we hope to assure the acceptance of CORA into practice and ultimately improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of the treatment of end-stage heart failure. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a debilitating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions.

"Use Frailty Status to Predict Postoperative Outcomes in Elderly Patient Frailty is increasingly recognized as a leading indicator of poor health outcomes, even death, as well as a barometer of how well patients respond to treatment. To truly provide patient-centered care, providers should be aware of each patient's frailty status and incorporate it into clinical decision making. Providers can now offer a number of invasive and aggressive procedures for cardiovascular disease, which involve risk, and can be painful. The treatment intensity need to match the expected patient outcome, yet providers do not have a reliable method to estimate prognosis for frail patients. In the study proposed here, we will use a novel approach that leverages the electronic health record (EHR) in identifying patient frailty status, with the goal of supporting retrospective clinical studies and prospective clinical decision making. Our preliminary studies have demonstrated the availability of frailty-related findings in EHR, the feasibility of extracting frailty findings, and the feasibility of using EHR-extracted frailty for outcome prediction. The specific aims of the project are to 1) Create a frailty ontology building on existing functional status and quality of life measurements; 2) Develop ontology guided, natural language processing (NLP) methods for extracting frailty descriptions and measurements; 3) Develop a model to aggregate NLP-extracted frailty findings to generate a patient-level frailty score; 4) Examine the all-cause mortality and all-cause hospital readmission one year after major cardiac procedures in heart failure patients with different frailty scores and assess the impact of this information on surgical decision making. Frailty is an important, but often overlooked, determinant of health outcomes in older adults. Providers can now offer invasive and aggressive treatments for various conditions, but these interventions involve risk and careful patient selection that balances risk and benefit is imperative. We will develop automated methods to extract frailty information from clinical records and generate an aggregated frailty score, which will enable retrospective analyses of EHR data for risk prediction and support prospective clinical decisional making.",Use Frailty Status to Predict Postoperative Outcomes in Elderly Patient,9354376,R56AG052536,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caregivers', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Comorbidity', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equilibrium', 'Fatigue', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Malnutrition', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Population', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Records', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Technology', 'Veterans', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'exercise capacity', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel strategies', 'older patient', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'treatment choice', 'treatment planning', 'trend']",NIA,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R56,2016,616197,-0.005528868866346096
"An Open Source Precision Medicine Platform for Cloud Operating Systems ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Rapid improvements in DNA sequencing and synthesis have the potential to usher in a new era of precision medicine. To realize this vision, however, we must re-imagine the computational and storage infrastructure used to manage and extract actionable results from the massive data sets made possible by widely available advances in DNA sequencing and synthetic biology. In conjunction with the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), we propose to build the Arvados platform so that a new ecosystem of clinical decision support applications will be able to navigate petabytes of global biomedical data and search millions of genomes in real-time (seconds). Our team has a proven track record of commercial success and high impact scientific research.

"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals. The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.",Objective decision support environment for clinical trials,9143689,U01CA160045,"['Algorithms', 'Assessment tool', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Differentiation Therapy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Property', 'Qualifying', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical decision-making', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interactive tool', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'predicting response', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual biopsy']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2016,522865,0.05500829848178935
"SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs)  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smart algorithms that effectively analyze patient care data can enhance clinical communication to save lives. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine estimated 98,000 preventable patient deaths occur annually in US hospitals due to miscommunication [1]. Electronic health records (EHRs) were expected to facilitate accurate communication within the care team and provide data to enable automated clinical decision support systems. Unfortunately, miscommunication remains a significant cause of patient deaths [2]. Providers are now required to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR systems to improve quality of care and patient outcomes. Despite this, providers continue to report that EHR systems are cumbersome and interfere with care-team communication. Information entered into an EHR is rarely used by nurses due to the time and difficulty involved in its retrieval. As a result, nurses continue to verbally convey critical patient care information to the next nurse during shift changes. Verbal report or hand-off, where critical patient information is exchanged in only minutes, is inefficient. Worse, it is highly susceptible to communication errors. Broader Impacts: Research: 1) Increase patient safety; 2) Provide preliminary data to expand this work to include physician-physician and physician-RN communication and decision-making in the EHR; 3) Share our discoveries to inform other industries who may also benefit from this technology. Education: 1) Contribute to curriculum enhancements whereby RN students learn strategies to recognize and effectively communicate CEs; 2) As part of curriculum enhancements, include healthcare applications for computer and information science students; 3) Disseminate findings via academic publications, professional meetings, a project website and social media. Mentoring: 1) Mentor budding scientists in the roles of research assistants (RAs) and post doctoral fellows studying nursing and computer science to forge collaborative interdisciplinary relationships for ongoing research; 2) Interest and recruit underrepresented students in STEM and careers in healthcare.

"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9147612,K01ES026837,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'research facility', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'training opportunity']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,178606,0.10551310028761554
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9131824,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'putamen', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'symptomatic improvement', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2016,492125,0.06579016453843936
"Patient-Centered Comparative Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Surveillance in IBD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Surveillance colonoscopy decreases the risk of developing CRC and increases the detection of CRC at an early stage. However, only a small proportion of eligible patients with IBD engage in surveillance colonoscopy as recommended by current practice guidelines. There is a need to identify effective approaches to surveillance colonoscopy and how to effectively communicate individualized CRC risk to IBD patients in order to reduce the mortality burden of this fatal IBD complication. My long-term goal is to conduct and implement research to reduce the incidence and mortality of IBD-associated CRC. My central hypotheses are that patient experiences influence acceptance of CRC surveillance colonoscopy, subgroups of IBD patients benefit from surveillance colonoscopy, and that a patient-centered communication tool using these factors can aid patient decision making regarding CRC surveillance. The specific aims of my proposal are: Aim 1: Define IBD patient experiences throughout the process of surveillance colonoscopy. Aim 2(a): Compare the effectiveness of colonoscopy surveillance strategies on the yield of dysplasia or CRC, CRC stage, treatment, and CRC-related mortality in a national cohort of patients with IBD. Aim 2(b): Identify subgroups of patients with IBD who derive benefit (or harm) from surveillance colonoscopy. Aim 3: Translate patient experiences of colonoscopy and effectiveness of surveillance colonoscopy effectiveness into an IBD CRC communication tool for decision support. Future studies will test the effectiveness of the communication tool on CRC surveillance adherence, early stage CRC detection, and patient satisfaction with decision making. I will achieve these aims through a partnership with the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America to conduct in-depth interviews with patients with IBD regarding their experiences with colonoscopy and to conduct patient consensus panels to develop and refine a communication tool for CRC surveillance decision making. I will compare the effectiveness of colonoscopy surveillance strategies on outcomes of CRC in a cohort of approximately 63,000 patients with IBD in the national Veterans Health Administration datasets aided by natural language processing to define key IBD variables currently lacking using automated administrative data. I am a gastroenterologist pursing my career goal of becoming an independently funded investigator in IBD, with a specific focus on the development of patient-provider communication tools to improve CRC outcomes. To achieve my career goals, I will require protected time, mentorship, and formal research training in qualitative methods, comparative effectiveness analyses, patient engagement, and development of communication tools. With the support and protected time from the AHRQ PCOR K08 Award, I will be able to complete my proposed research and career training goals and secure independent funding. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are rising in the U.S., and patients with IBD are at an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. This project compares strategies using colonoscopy to reduce or prevent colorectal cancer among patients with IBD and investigates how patients' past experiences with colonoscopy influence their decision to have future colonoscopies. Development of a communication tool that can improve how patients understand their personal risks of colorectal cancer that their ability to make informed decisions could have a substantial public health impact.",Patient-Centered Comparative Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Surveillance in IBD,9114490,K08HS024122,[' '],AHRQ,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K08,2016,153360,0.04158956742332528
"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develp a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data. This pioneering research directly impacts public health by improving the quality of care through enhanced reminder functionality in the EHRs.",A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications,8978947,K99LM011575,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Hybrids', 'Institution', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medical Informatics', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Reminder Systems', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'System', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care delivery', 'career', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'colorectal cancer prevention', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'health care delivery', 'improved', 'open source', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2015,83160,-0.02709387854679959
"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,8849399,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'contrast enhanced', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2015,554150,0.004316765109471355
"CORA_TM_A Personalized Cardiac Counselor for Optimal Therapy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This project aims to introduce a clinical decision support system, CORA (Cardiac Outcomes Risk Assessment) for advanced heart failure (HF) a devastating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions. The project specifically aims to moderate the deployment ventricular assist devices (VADs) which have been recently approved as destination (DT) such that patients most likely to benefit will be prioritized, while those better served with palliative care will be spare from unnecessary risks of debilitating side effects. The proposed system will leverage proven prognostic models based on advanced data mining and machine learning algorithms, and be packaged as a user-friendly computer application that would be used at key decision points in the course of treatment. It would provide both physician and patient with prognostic assessment based on the fusion of: patient-specific data, expert knowledge, and retrospective meta-analysis. This four-year project will develop a multi-platform software application that integrates modules for: forecasting, decision support, communication, decision making and visualization of data. This will be achieved through completion of four specific aims: (SA1) Expand existing inference (prognostic) algorithms and develop expert decision models to compute personalized estimate of life expectancy and risk of adverse events; (SA2) Create a computer application to assist patients to navigate their treatment options as they reflect their personal preferences and beliefs; (SA3) Incorporate these prognostic and decision models into user-friendly user interfaces for physicians, patients and their family caregivers; and (SA4) Conduct a multi- center study with respect to both qualitative and quantitative metrics of efficacy related to mortality, morbidity and quality of life. Training data capitalizing upon the NIH-funded Interagency Registry for Mechanical Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) as well as recently published guidance documents by the American Heart Association (AHA) and International Society of Heart & Lung Transplantation (ISHLT.) This project will involve a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: bioengineering, advanced heart failure cardiology, cardiac surgery, computer science (machine learning/data mining), medical ethics, and palliative care. Carnegie Mellon University, one of the Nation's leading institutions for Computer Science will coordinate this project to assure a productive collaboration with four clinical sites: Allegheny Health Network (Pittsburgh), U. Colorado Denver, Duke University, and Harvard/Brigham & Women's hospital. By achieve consensus amongst stakeholders, we hope to assure the acceptance of CORA into practice and ultimately improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of the treatment of end-stage heart failure.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a debilitating disease affecting over 5 million Americans, and a leading cause of Medicare hospital admissions.

"SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs)  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smart algorithms that effectively analyze patient care data can enhance clinical communication to save lives. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine estimated 98,000 preventable patient deaths occur annually in US hospitals due to miscommunication [1]. Electronic health records (EHRs) were expected to facilitate accurate communication within the care team and provide data to enable automated clinical decision support systems. Unfortunately, miscommunication remains a significant cause of patient deaths [2]. Providers are now required to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR systems to improve quality of care and patient outcomes. Despite this, providers continue to report that EHR systems are cumbersome and interfere with care-team communication. Information entered into an EHR is rarely used by nurses due to the time and difficulty involved in its retrieval. As a result, nurses continue to verbally convey critical patient care information to the next nurse during shift changes. Verbal report or hand-off, where critical patient information is exchanged in only minutes, is inefficient. Worse, it is highly susceptible to communication errors. Broader Impacts: Research: 1) Increase patient safety; 2) Provide preliminary data to expand this work to include physician-physician and physician-RN communication and decision-making in the EHR; 3) Share our discoveries to inform other industries who may also benefit from this technology. Education: 1) Contribute to curriculum enhancements whereby RN students learn strategies to recognize and effectively communicate CEs; 2) As part of curriculum enhancements, include healthcare applications for computer and information science students; 3) Disseminate findings via academic publications, professional meetings, a project website and social media. Mentoring: 1) Mentor budding scientists in the roles of research assistants (RAs) and post doctoral fellows studying nursing and computer science to forge collaborative interdisciplinary relationships for ongoing research; 2) Interest and recruit underrepresented students in STEM and careers in healthcare. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The electronic health record (EHR) has been thought to be a tool to decrease patient deaths related to miscommunication. However, the current EHR falls short of this goal. We propose to develop and test an algorithm that will augment the EHR to more effectively assist nurses in decision-making and communication, ultimately increasing patient safety.",SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs) ,8932003,R01EB020395,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'STEM career', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underrepresented Students', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'computer science', 'falls', 'forging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'light weight', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'social', 'tool', 'usability', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2015,248507,0.030748668627364795
"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals. The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.",Objective decision support environment for clinical trials,8926887,U01CA160045,"['Algorithms', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Differentiation Therapy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Property', 'Qualifying', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thoracic Radiography', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'body system', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical decision-making', 'image processing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'male', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NCI,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U01,2015,522865,0.05500829848178935
"Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diseases and disorders directly affected by dopamine systems (e.g., drug addiction and Parkinson's disease) highlight the importance of these systems in motivated human behavior and cognition. The dopamine system is known to be a critical component of normal learning, reward processing, and decision-making (reviewed in Montague et al., 2004). Unfortunately, our present knowledge of dopamine systems in human brains is relatively sparse compared to the wealth of experimentation and computational modeling on these systems in rodents and non-human primates. Previously, technological constraints have limited direct experimentation in human brains. This proposal capitalizes on our group's recent technological innovation, which was supported by the NIH R21 mechanism - CEBRA: R21DA024140 - and resulted in the successful completion of the first sub-second measurements of dopamine release in a human brain. Furthermore, these measurements took place during an active decision-making task that was framed by computational models of learning and reward processing (Kishida et al., 2011 and Kishida et al., under review). We propose to pursue three specific aims, which combine our technological advance with active learning tasks designed to probe the role of dopamine in human behavior. Our aims incorporate three learning signals, where actual and counterfactual experience will each be examined in human striatal responses. The proposed work will inform on the controversial role for dopamine in reward/movement interactions. The experiments proposed will yield unprecedented insight into the function of the dopamine system in the humans afflicted with Parkinson's disease and Essential Tremor. With the support of the NIH (R21DA024140), our team successfully developed a complete prototype system for making electrochemical measurements of dopamine delivery in the human brain. Feasibility has been demonstrated by obtaining the first dopamine measurements in the striata of subjects with Parkinson's during a decision-making task. This substantial preliminary work is now ready for a larger scale with specific hypothesis testing about the role of dopamine systems in Parkinson's disease, Essential tremor, and human decision-making and behavior.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Experiments and computational models (primarily investigated in rodents and non-human primates) suggest dopamine systems in the brain are essential for normal learning, reward-processing, and ongoing decision- making. This proposal builds upon our group's innovative work, which - for the first time - recorded sub- second measurements of dopamine in human subjects and amalgamated these measurements with computational models of dopamine function. Herein we propose to use this newly developed technology to generate unprecedented insight into the function of dopamine systems directly in humans.          ",Dopaminergic encoding of counterfactual information in human striatum,9029452,R01NS092701,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Electrodes', 'Essential Tremor', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Replacement Therapy', 'Research Personnel', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'dopamine system', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'experience', 'extracellular', 'human subject', 'implantation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nonhuman primate', 'prototype', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'social', 'technological innovation', 'temporal measurement']",NINDS,VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INST AND ST UNIV,R01,2015,507375,0.06579016453843936
"Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records Public Health Motivation: National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable variability, reflected in different locales having anywhere from 20-80% compliance with evidence-based guidelines. Much of this is due to uncertainty, with half of clinical practice guidelines lacking adequate evidence to confirm their efficacy. This is unsurprising when clinical trials cost >$15 million to answer individual clinical questions. The result is medical practice routinely driven by individual opinio and anecdotal experience. While Big Data has revolutionized how society processes internet scale information, the status quo in clinical decision making remains the manual interpretation of literature and isolated decision aids. The adoption of electronic health records (EHR) creates a new opportunity to answer a ""grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS)."" In a learning health system, we could automatically adapt knowledge from the collective expertise embedded in the EHR practices of real clinicians and close the loop by disseminating that knowledge back as executable decision support. Candidate Goals and Objectives: The unifying goal of this BD2K K01 proposal is the mentored career development of Jonathan H. Chen, MD, PhD. This proposal will accelerate his transition into an independent physician scientist, towards his long-term goals to produce Big Data technologies that answer such grand challenges in clinical decision support. His near-term objective is developing methods to translate EHR data into useful knowledge in the form of patient- specific, point-of-care clinical order recommendations for acute medical hospitalizations. His doctoral background in computer science gives him the technical capability to achieve these objectives, while his medical training will ensure clinically meaningful results. His preliminary work to build an order recommender, analogous to commercial product recommenders, demonstrates the proposal's overall feasibility. Institutional Environment and Career Development: The research facilities and training opportunities at Stanford University provide the ideal environment to achieve these objectives, with established and growing Centers for Biomedical Informatics Research, the Biomedical Data Science Initiative, and the first Clinical Informatics Fellowship accredited in the nation. Prof. Russ Altman, Director of the Biomedical Informatics Training Program, will lead a collaborative team of mentors with expertise in clinical decision support (Mary Goldstein), implementation science (Steven Asch), data-mining electronic health records (Nigam Shah), statistical learning algorithms (Lester Mackey), and healthcare statistics (Michael Baiocchi). Combined with respective didactic training, this mentorship will enable Dr. Chen to achieve his objectives through a series of research aims. Research Aims: The overriding hypothesis of the proposal is that clinical knowledge reflected in clinical order patterns from historical EHR data can improve medical decision making when adapted into functional clinical decision support. The specific aims each address components of this concept, as they seek to: (1) Develop the algorithms to learn clinical order patterns from historical EHR data, building on a preliminary recommender system; (2) Assess how underlying clinician proficiency affects the quality of those learned clinical order patterns through observational data inference against external standards; and (3) Determine the impact of automatically learned clinical decision support (CDS) on (simulated) clinical workflows through a randomized controlled crossover trial of human-computer interfaces with real clinicians. Expected Results and General Significance: By the completion of the proposed work, Dr. Chen will answer the grand challenge in clinical decision support (CDS) by automating much of the CDS production process, and have direct translational impact with a prototype system. This will advance the field with new paradigms of generating and disseminating clinical knowledge, which can then improve the consistency and quality of healthcare delivery. Additional benefits will include methods to identify and monitor areas of high practice variability for targeted optimization and improve predictive models that inform precision medicine. With this applied research experience and career development, Dr. Chen can compete for R01 funding and become an independent physician scientist developing Big Data approaches to solve national healthcare problems in clinical decision making.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    National healthcare quality is compromised by undesirable practice variability and medical uncertainty, with most medical practice routinely driven by individual opinions and anecdotal experience. With methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed project will automatically learn patterns in raw clinical transaction data to capture the undocumented knowledge of real-world clinicians, and close the loop in a learning health system by disseminating that knowledge back as clinical decision support to improve patient care.                ",Data-Mining Clinical Decision Support from Electronic Health Records,9044538,K01ES026837,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Back', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Research', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Internet', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Locales', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical Residency', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Production', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'User-Computer Interface', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'computer science', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'evidence based guidelines', 'experience', 'health care delivery', 'health care quality', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'research facility', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIEHS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,178606,0.10551310028761554
"Patient-Centered Comparative Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Surveillance in IBD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Surveillance colonoscopy decreases the risk of developing CRC and increases the detection of CRC at an early stage. However, only a small proportion of eligible patients with IBD engage in surveillance colonoscopy as recommended by current practice guidelines. There is a need to identify effective approaches to surveillance colonoscopy and how to effectively communicate individualized CRC risk to IBD patients in order to reduce the mortality burden of this fatal IBD complication. My long-term goal is to conduct and implement research to reduce the incidence and mortality of IBD-associated CRC. My central hypotheses are that patient experiences influence acceptance of CRC surveillance colonoscopy, subgroups of IBD patients benefit from surveillance colonoscopy, and that a patient-centered communication tool using these factors can aid patient decision making regarding CRC surveillance. The specific aims of my proposal are: Aim 1: Define IBD patient experiences throughout the process of surveillance colonoscopy. Aim 2(a): Compare the effectiveness of colonoscopy surveillance strategies on the yield of dysplasia or CRC, CRC stage, treatment, and CRC-related mortality in a national cohort of patients with IBD. Aim 2(b): Identify subgroups of patients with IBD who derive benefit (or harm) from surveillance colonoscopy. Aim 3: Translate patient experiences of colonoscopy and effectiveness of surveillance colonoscopy effectiveness into an IBD CRC communication tool for decision support. Future studies will test the effectiveness of the communication tool on CRC surveillance adherence, early stage CRC detection, and patient satisfaction with decision making. I will achieve these aims through a partnership with the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America to conduct in-depth interviews with patients with IBD regarding their experiences with colonoscopy and to conduct patient consensus panels to develop and refine a communication tool for CRC surveillance decision making. I will compare the effectiveness of colonoscopy surveillance strategies on outcomes of CRC in a cohort of approximately 63,000 patients with IBD in the national Veterans Health Administration datasets aided by natural language processing to define key IBD variables currently lacking using automated administrative data. I am a gastroenterologist pursing my career goal of becoming an independently funded investigator in IBD, with a specific focus on the development of patient-provider communication tools to improve CRC outcomes. To achieve my career goals, I will require protected time, mentorship, and formal research training in qualitative methods, comparative effectiveness analyses, patient engagement, and development of communication tools. With the support and protected time from the AHRQ PCOR K08 Award, I will be able to complete my proposed research and career training goals and secure independent funding.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rates of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are rising in the U.S., and patients with IBD are at an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer. This project compares strategies using colonoscopy to reduce or prevent colorectal cancer among patients with IBD and investigates how patients' past experiences with colonoscopy influence their decision to have future colonoscopies. Development of a communication tool that can improve how patients understand their personal risks of colorectal cancer that their ability to make informed decisions could have a substantial public health impact.            ",Patient-Centered Comparative Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer Surveillance in IBD,8948902,K08HS024122,[' '],AHRQ,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K08,2015,153360,0.04158956742332528
"Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amphetamine dependence (AD) is an important public health problem, which has been linked to persistent executive and affective processing impairments. Specifically, amphetamine dependent individuals (ADI) demonstrate poor decision-making, particularly with respect to keeping track of new information and using this knowledge to guide future decisions. In addition, ADI have difficulties in appraising and regulating negative emotion, which has been linked to poor social functioning and higher likelihood of relapse. Given that emotion plays an important role in modulating and guiding decision-making, surprisingly little is known about how such dysfunctions interact in ADI, and how they may contribute to impairments in everyday functioning. Bayesian learning models provide a way to formally represent an individual's beliefs about the environment and the dynamic updating of those beliefs when new observations are made. Such computational framework can help to better delineate the potential impact of emotion on the dynamic representation of individuals' expectations about choice options, on the degree to which this cumulative knowledge is used to predict future outcomes, and on the cognitive strategies individuals use to select actions. The proposed study will use such Bayesian modeling approach, combined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to assess the neurocognitive processes underlying a) potential deficits in the strategic and predictive processes guiding reward-based decision-making in ADI and b) ADI potential overrepresentation of or failure to integrate negative emotion into such decision-making. To do so, 40 ADI and 40 healthy comparison subjects (CS) will perform a gambling task under neutral and sad mood, and while undergoing fMRI. Several decision strategies and the associated Bayesian outcome predictions will be estimated and correlated with neural activity at the time of decision. These measures will be used to assess and quantify differences between ADI and CS 1) in the computational processes underlying reward-based decision (Aim1) and 2) in the computational processes underlying the integration of negative emotion into reward-based decision-making (Aim 2). The outcomes of this study will help to refine neurocognitive models of AD by delineating the computational processes that go awry in ADI and will help identify more precise neurocognitive predictors of executive and affective dysfunction an ADI.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amphetamine dependence has been linked to decision-making and emotion processing impairments. Understanding how the disease may impact the computational mechanisms underlying affect infusion into decision-making will provide a mechanistic rationale for developing interventions aimed at improving amphetamine dependent individuals' daily functioning and response to adverse emotions, and will help develop more precise severity markers and predictors of relapse for amphetamine dependence. This in turn could advantageously reduce costs to the healthcare and criminal justice systems.                ",Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence,8892807,F32DA036959,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amphetamine Dependence', 'Amphetamines', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attenuated', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Belief', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Criminal Justice', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infusion procedures', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serotonergic System', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Social support', 'System', 'Time', 'Update', 'base', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data modeling', 'expectation', 'improved', 'information processing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F32,2015,56042,0.048378194866603726

"A Framework to Enhance Decision Support by Invoking NLP: Methods and Applications  PROJECT SUMMARY Electronic Health Records (EHRs) can improve the quality of healthcare delivery in the United States, by providing automated best-practice reminders to clinicians and patients. However such functionality is currently limited to narrow areas of clinical practice, as existing decision support systems can process only structured data, due to lack of a suitable framework and concerns about accuracy and portability. Preliminary work by the PI has shown that rule-based approach can be used to develop broad-domain reminder systems that can utilize free-text in addition to the structured data. The PI has developed prototype systems for cervical and colorectal cancer prevention. These systems consist of rule-based composite models of national guidelines, and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) parsers. The NLP parsers extract the patient variables required for applying the guidelines. However further research is needed to extend the systems and to ensure their accuracy for clinical deployment. In the mentored phase, the PI will collaborate with clinicians to extend and iteratively optimize and validate the systems, and will make them available in open-source so that they can be adapted for deployment at other institutions (aim 1 - K99). In the independent phase, the PI will research methods to facilitate rapid development, deployment and cross- institutional portability of similar systems. Specifically, the PI will develop a hybrid design for the parsers and investigate domain adaptation and active learning methods, for reducing the manual effort for development and adaptation of the NLP parsers (aim 2 - R00). To enable other researchers to reuse the developed methodologies and software resources, a toolkit will be developed that will support the construction and deployment of similar systems (aim 3 - R00). The toolkit will consist of user-friendly tools and templates to replicate the processes engineered in the case studies, and will build on the SHARPn data normalization tooling and other open-source tools. The independent phase will be in collaboration with Intermountain Healthcare. The PI's career goal is to become a scientific leader in clinical informatics with a focus on optimizing clinical decision making. The PI has strong background in clinical medicine and medical informatics, and will receive mentoring from Drs. Hongfang Liu, Christopher Chute, Robert Greenes and Rajeev Chaudhry, who have complimentary areas of expertise. The mentored (K99) phase will be for 2 years at Mayo Clinic Rochester, wherein the PI will undertake courses on decision support and will get mentored training in NLP and health information standards. This will prepare the PI for independent research in R00 phase on portability and tooling. Completion of the proposed work will enable the PI to seek further funding for piloting clinical deployment of the developed systems, measuring their clinical impact, and for scaling the approach to other clinical domains and institutions. The career grant will enable the PI to establish himself as an independent investigator and to make significant contributions towards advancing clinical decision support for improving care delivery.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The potential of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve care delivery by providing best-practice reminders is unrealized, because reminder systems currently operate in narrow areas of clinical practice, as they can process only structured data. The proposed framework will enable construction of reminder systems that can encompass broader areas of practice, due to their capability to utilize free-text as well as structured EHR data.

"Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 15,210 deaths per year in the United States. It is estimated that 72,570 new bladder cancer cases will be diagnosed in 2013. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. MRI and CT are important methods for pre-treatment staging or treatment response monitoring for a variety of bladder cancers. CT is an effective non-invasive modality for measuring primary site gross tumor volume (GTV) and the addition of MRI is on the rise. GTV has been used as a biomarker for predicting treatment outcome of bladder tumors. Other pathological information and diagnostic test (bimanual evaluation, cystoscopy) results and immunohistochemical biomarkers are also useful for staging and treatment response monitoring. The goal of this project is to develop effective decision support tools that merge image-based and non-image-based biomarkers to assist radiologists and oncologists in assessment of cancer stage and change as a result of treatment. We will (1) develop a quantitative image analysis tool (QIBC) for bladder GTV estimation on multi-modality (MM) images, (2) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-S) to assist clinicians in cancer staging, (3) develop a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) to assist clinicians in evaluation of the change in the tumor characteristics as a result of neoadjuvant treatment, (4) evaluate the effects of QIBC and CDSS-T on inter-clinician variability and efficiency in estimation of GTV and treatment response, and (5) evaluate CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies. We hypothesize that the use of QIBC, CDSS-S and CDSS-T can improve the clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation on MM imaging exams, the assessment of bladder cancer stage and response to treatment. To test our hypothesis, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to collect a database of multi-modality MR, CT exams of bladder cancers for development, training and testing of the QIBC and CDSS algorithms; (2) to develop advanced computer vision techniques to quantitatively estimate bladder GTV and image characteristics; (3) to develop predictive models using machine learning techniques to combine MM image-based, pathological and immunohistochemical biomarkers for cancer staging and determination of non-responders; (4) to compare the inter-clinician variability and efficiency in clinicians' estimation of GTV and treatment response with and without the proposed QIBC and CDSS-T by observer studies; and (5) to evaluate the CDSS-S and CDSS-T as decision support tools in pilot clinical studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: If successfully developed, the CDSS-S and CDSS-T can serve as non-invasive, objective, and reproducible clinical decision support systems for cancer staging and treatment response monitoring. Correct staging of the bladder cancer is crucial for the decision of chemotherapy treatment and minimizing the risk of under-treatment or over-treatment. If the response to chemotherapy can be estimated accurately it is possible to identify those patients that do not respond, stop the treatment early, and seek alternative treatment. In addition, although we will focus on the specific application to the bladder tumors in this proposed project, we will design the decision support tools in a modular, expandable, and re-trainable framework. The software package will be versatile and is adaptable to other tumor types or imaging modalities in the future by proper retraining with case samples of the tumor type of interest and expansion of the decision support tools as needed. Therefore, the development of the CDSS-S and CDSS-T will potentially benefit not only the bladder tumor patients but also patients with other tumor types that require staging and monitoring of treatment response.            ",Biomarkers for Staging and Treatment Response Monitoring of Bladder Cancer,8697721,U01CA179106,"['Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Breast', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Carcinoma in Situ', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cystoscopy', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Follicular Lymphoma', 'Future', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Head and neck structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lymphovascular', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Muscle', 'Necrosis', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Palpable', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Techniques', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Tissue', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'computer monitor', 'computerized', 'design', 'flexibility', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'oncology program', 'open source', 'physical conditioning', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'radiologist', 'response', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2014,501194,0.004316765109471355
"SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs)  ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Smart algorithms that effectively analyze patient care data can enhance clinical communication to save lives. In 2000, the Institute of Medicine estimated 98,000 preventable patient deaths occur annually in US hospitals due to miscommunication [1]. Electronic health records (EHRs) were expected to facilitate accurate communication within the care team and provide data to enable automated clinical decision support systems. Unfortunately, miscommunication remains a significant cause of patient deaths [2]. Providers are now required to demonstrate meaningful use of EHR systems to improve quality of care and patient outcomes. Despite this, providers continue to report that EHR systems are cumbersome and interfere with care-team communication. Information entered into an EHR is rarely used by nurses due to the time and difficulty involved in its retrieval. As a result, nurses continue to verbally convey critical patient care information to the next nurse during shift changes. Verbal report or hand-off, where critical patient information is exchanged in only minutes, is inefficient. Worse, it is highly susceptible to communication errors. Broader Impacts: Research: 1) Increase patient safety; 2) Provide preliminary data to expand this work to include physician-physician and physician-RN communication and decision-making in the EHR; 3) Share our discoveries to inform other industries who may also benefit from this technology. Education: 1) Contribute to curriculum enhancements whereby RN students learn strategies to recognize and effectively communicate CEs; 2) As part of curriculum enhancements, include healthcare applications for computer and information science students; 3) Disseminate findings via academic publications, professional meetings, a project website and social media. Mentoring: 1) Mentor budding scientists in the roles of research assistants (RAs) and post doctoral fellows studying nursing and computer science to forge collaborative interdisciplinary relationships for ongoing research; 2) Interest and recruit underrepresented students in STEM and careers in healthcare. RELEVANCE (See instructions): The electronic health record (EHR) has been thought to be a top! to decrease patient deaths related to miscommunication. However, the current EHR falls short of this goal. We propose to develop and test an algorithm that will augment the EHR to more effectively assist nurses in decision-making and communication, ultimately increasing patient safety.                 n/a",SCH: Enhancing Nurse Decision-Making via Augmented Communication Tools (ACTs) ,8894220,R01EB020395,"['Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Communication Tools', 'Computer Simulation', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronics', 'Event', 'Fever', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Publications', 'Quality of Care', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'STEM career', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'computer science', 'falls', 'forging', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'light weight', 'meetings', 'patient safety', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'social', 'usability', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2014,251572,0.029649216304439664
"Objective decision support environment for clinical trials     DESCRIPTION:  Brain tumors are the second- and fifth-most common cause of cancer death in males and females under 40, respectively. The 5-year relative survival rate is only 33%, even after decades of research into new treatments. Imaging based on ""virtual biopsy"" can provide information about the entire lesion in a minimally or non-invasive way. Prior work by our group has demonstrated that image processing methods applied to serial examinations together (as opposed to applying them to individual examinations) can make subtle changes in brain tumors more apparent, allowing earlier detection of progression. We see the union of virtual biopsy methods and change detection methods as an innovative and powerful combination that our team is uniquely qualified to develop and evaluate. In this application, we will implement several feature selection (FS) methods in a tool that is ""image friendly"". This tool will help select informative features from images; apply a wide range of existing ML algorithms to determine which features are important predictors of therapy response, and to evaluate the impact of a decision support application using these features and ML in a clinical trial. The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals.           The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.  .

"Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Amphetamine dependence (AD) is an important public health problem, which has been linked to persistent executive and affective processing impairments. Specifically, amphetamine dependent individuals (ADI) demonstrate poor decision-making, particularly with respect to keeping track of new information and using this knowledge to guide future decisions. In addition, ADI have difficulties in appraising and regulating negative emotion, which has been linked to poor social functioning and higher likelihood of relapse. Given that emotion plays an important role in modulating and guiding decision-making, surprisingly little is known about how such dysfunctions interact in ADI, and how they may contribute to impairments in everyday functioning. Bayesian learning models provide a way to formally represent an individual's beliefs about the environment and the dynamic updating of those beliefs when new observations are made. Such computational framework can help to better delineate the potential impact of emotion on the dynamic representation of individuals' expectations about choice options, on the degree to which this cumulative knowledge is used to predict future outcomes, and on the cognitive strategies individuals use to select actions. The proposed study will use such Bayesian modeling approach, combined with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to assess the neurocognitive processes underlying a) potential deficits in the strategic and predictive processes guiding reward-based decision-making in ADI and b) ADI potential overrepresentation of or failure to integrate negative emotion into such decision-making. To do so, 40 ADI and 40 healthy comparison subjects (CS) will perform a gambling task under neutral and sad mood, and while undergoing fMRI. Several decision strategies and the associated Bayesian outcome predictions will be estimated and correlated with neural activity at the time of decision. These measures will be used to assess and quantify differences between ADI and CS 1) in the computational processes underlying reward-based decision (Aim1) and 2) in the computational processes underlying the integration of negative emotion into reward-based decision-making (Aim 2). The outcomes of this study will help to refine neurocognitive models of AD by delineating the computational processes that go awry in ADI and will help identify more precise neurocognitive predictors of executive and affective dysfunction an ADI.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Amphetamine dependence has been linked to decision-making and emotion processing impairments. Understanding how the disease may impact the computational mechanisms underlying affect infusion into decision-making will provide a mechanistic rationale for developing interventions aimed at improving amphetamine dependent individuals' daily functioning and response to adverse emotions, and will help develop more precise severity markers and predictors of relapse for amphetamine dependence. This in turn could advantageously reduce costs to the healthcare and criminal justice systems.                ",Bayesian Modeling of Mood Effects on Decision-Making in Amphetamine Dependence,8782905,F32DA036959,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Amphetamine Dependence', 'Amphetamines', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attenuated', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Belief', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Simulation', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Criminal Justice', 'Cues', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gambling', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infusion procedures', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Neurocognitive', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reliance', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Functioning', 'Social support', 'System', 'Time', 'Update', 'base', 'computer framework', 'cost', 'daily functioning', 'data modeling', 'expectation', 'improved', 'information processing', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'success']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",F32,2014,53282,0.048378194866603726
"CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SUMMARY This project aims to produce and beta-test a clinical decision support application for end- stage heart failure, titled CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System. It will be designed for patients with progressive heart failure who may eventually become candidates for ventricular assist device (VAD) therapy. The software will be build upon existing machine learning and data mining technology, developed by the PI and colleagues, designed to predict 90-day mortality following VAD implantation. This Phase- 1 effort will entail development of graphic user interfaces for both patients and clinicians to incorporate personalized prognostic information into a functional decision-support utility. The inference algorithm will also be expanded to encompass adverse events, and risk of readmission. In this Phase-1 feasibility project, CHRiSS will be programmed and beta-tested at West Penn Allegheny Health System (WPAHS). This will entail semi- structured interviews to collect relevant expert knowledge, and mining the electronic medical records (EMR) to calibrate the prognostic algorithm to the institution-specific data. Successful completion of this Phase I project will lead to a multi-center trial in which the software is fully validated. Ultimate succes of this project will result in a software application that will optimize the benefit of VAD therapy to public health, while reducing cost by reducing the unacceptably high rate of adverse events and unnecessary readmissions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Narrative Heart-assist devices are becoming more commonly used to treat people with severe cardiac failure - who otherwise have few options to return to a normal life. It is estimated that tens of thousands of Americans could benefit from this therapy annually; however, only a few thousand are performed per year. This project aims to develop a software application to better inform patients and doctors about the risks and benefits of this therapy. It will assist patients and doctors to work together when weighing options - with respect to both survival and quality of life. The long-term benefits would be to improve the efficiency of delivering this therapy, thereby reducing the cost, and expanding its distribution to the many people that need it.            ",CHRiSS: Cardiac Health Risk Stratification System,8592756,R41HL120428,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Businesses', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Effectiveness Analysis', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Foundations', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Heart failure', 'Heart-Assist Devices', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Needs Assessment', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Period', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Software Tools', 'Staging', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Update', 'Work', 'computer human interaction', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'graphical user interface', 'implantation', 'improved', 'mortality', 'outcome forecast', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'satisfaction', 'success', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability', 'ventricular assist device']",NHLBI,BLENDERHOUSE,R41,2013,150000,0.021118402619929404

"Exploring the Feasibility of Approximate Sequential Pattern Discovery in Massive    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to predict the clinical course of intensive care unit (ICU) patients in a timely manner can guide decision making and accelerate research into therapeutic efforts and the economics of care. To achieve this, a variety of ICU-based risk scoring systems have been proposed to risk stratify patients using ""snapshots"" of variables at specific points in time. These systems are not designed to provide a continuous assessment of patient status in real-time. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in intelligent patient monitoring (IPM) systems that can use information in continuously recorded ICU signals to recognize changes suggestive of dangerous pathophysiologieis. The aim of our research is to augment the knowledge base for these IPM systems by exploring the feasibility of pattern discovery methods to identify novel markers of future risk from large volumes of continuous ICU data. We focus, in particular, on sophisticated methods from data mining and machine learning that are computationally efficient, robust, and able to identify multi-parameter time-series trends useful for risk stratification. To facilitate these efforts, we will utilize the high volume acuity environment of the Surgical ICU (SICU) at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. We will study the use of pattern discovery methods to identify high and low risk patterns in historical data from over 5,000 patients admitted to the SICU, and then prospectively evaluate our findings on real-time SICU data at the Henry Ford from over 3,700 patients. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to develop novel decision support tools based on high and low risk patterns discovered from large historical time-series ICU datasets. Using fully-automated and computationally efficient algorithms, we will first identify characteristic units of temporal activity that explain the multi-parameter physiological time-series for ICU patients, and then discover approximate sequences of these characteristic units associated with adverse events in patients with known outcomes. The patterns discovered using our approach will be integrated into real-time decision support tools to signal alerts when high risk patterns are observed; and (2) to prospectively validate decision support tools based on high and low risk patterns in ICU time-series on real-time ICU data. We will conduct a pilot study validating these tools by studying the association between the predictions for these tools and actual adverse outcomes observed in the SICU. Each tool will be evaluated based on the following metrics: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and clinical time-frame of prediction. We will further compare the improvement provided by these tools to existing risk scoring systems.           Project Narrative Successful management of critical care patients depends on the ability of clinicians to estimate the risk of future adverse events, and ideally, to anticipate and prevent those events. We propose to explore low-cost, and widely applicable methods that would improve the ability of physicians to identify patients at high risk for adverse events in real time in ICU settings. The key concept for this proposal is that time-series data collected in the ICU contain valuable prognostic information that can be extracted using novel, sophisticated techniques drawn from the domains of machine learning and data mining. This information can be used to develop real- time clinical tools to improve management of critically ill patients.",Exploring the Feasibility of Approximate Sequential Pattern Discovery in Massive,8318881,R21LM010954,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Admission', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Intensive Care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2012,159264,0.017862045567751204

The final stage of th proposal will test the decision support tools in 3 clinical scenarios to see if they are able to significantly improve the decision making of clinicians in a clinical trial.  The long-term goal of this proposal is to develop virtual biopsy technology that will enhance the clinical decision making process by providing tools for investigation of image-based therapy response assessment tools, that may also have some ability to predict outcome. We hope to apply the technology to other organ systems and other imaging technologies. We anticipate this project will impact clinical trials by enabling investigation of alternative outcome measures that are objectively assessed using algorithm evaluation methods. Such a toolset should be useful to the entire cancer imaging community to help evaluate features in old and new imaging technologies that correlate with patient survival. As such, this is ideal for helping the Quantitative Imaging Network (QIN) achieve its goals.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist. When imaging was relatively straightforward (e.g. a chest X-ray of lung cancer), a measurement or a visual assessment was a reasonable metric. Today, advanced imaging devices produce large amounts of data that reflect a range of properties. In this work, we build on previous work developing computer techniques for identifying and characterizing changes in brain tumors, using MRI. In this proposal, we will focus on building 1) a high quality database of brain cancer imaging, clinical data, ""-omic"" data, outcomes data; 2) a library of easily accessed tools for computing features that might be important predictors of tumor response; 3) a tool that will help objectively establish the feature() that are valuable through a variety of machine learning methods; and 4) use the above to create a decision support tool that will be used in 3 clinical trial situations.  .               The selection of features that reflect response to therapy has long been the domain of the clinical radiologist.

"Exploring the Feasibility of Approximate Sequential Pattern Discovery in Massive    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to predict the clinical course of intensive care unit (ICU) patients in a timely manner can guide decision making and accelerate research into therapeutic efforts and the economics of care. To achieve this, a variety of ICU-based risk scoring systems have been proposed to risk stratify patients using ""snapshots"" of variables at specific points in time. These systems are not designed to provide a continuous assessment of patient status in real-time. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in intelligent patient monitoring (IPM) systems that can use information in continuously recorded ICU signals to recognize changes suggestive of dangerous pathophysiologieis. The aim of our research is to augment the knowledge base for these IPM systems by exploring the feasibility of pattern discovery methods to identify novel markers of future risk from large volumes of continuous ICU data. We focus, in particular, on sophisticated methods from data mining and machine learning that are computationally efficient, robust, and able to identify multi-parameter time-series trends useful for risk stratification. To facilitate these efforts, we will utilize the high volume acuity environment of the Surgical ICU (SICU) at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. We will study the use of pattern discovery methods to identify high and low risk patterns in historical data from over 5,000 patients admitted to the SICU, and then prospectively evaluate our findings on real-time SICU data at the Henry Ford from over 3,700 patients. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) to develop novel decision support tools based on high and low risk patterns discovered from large historical time-series ICU datasets. Using fully-automated and computationally efficient algorithms, we will first identify characteristic units of temporal activity that explain the multi-parameter physiological time-series for ICU patients, and then discover approximate sequences of these characteristic units associated with adverse events in patients with known outcomes. The patterns discovered using our approach will be integrated into real-time decision support tools to signal alerts when high risk patterns are observed; and (2) to prospectively validate decision support tools based on high and low risk patterns in ICU time-series on real-time ICU data. We will conduct a pilot study validating these tools by studying the association between the predictions for these tools and actual adverse outcomes observed in the SICU. Each tool will be evaluated based on the following metrics: sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and clinical time-frame of prediction. We will further compare the improvement provided by these tools to existing risk scoring systems.           Project Narrative Successful management of critical care patients depends on the ability of clinicians to estimate the risk of future adverse events, and ideally, to anticipate and prevent those events. We propose to explore low-cost, and widely applicable methods that would improve the ability of physicians to identify patients at high risk for adverse events in real time in ICU settings. The key concept for this proposal is that time-series data collected in the ICU contain valuable prognostic information that can be extracted using novel, sophisticated techniques drawn from the domains of machine learning and data mining. This information can be used to develop real- time clinical tools to improve management of critically ill patients.",Exploring the Feasibility of Approximate Sequential Pattern Discovery in Massive,8191345,R21LM010954,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Admission', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Intensive Care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cost', 'data mining', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'tool', 'trend']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2011,168115,0.017862045567751204

"Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10): Increasing Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions. Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced computational techniques, applied to complex, multidimensional, streaming, clinical data (historic, physiologic, laboratory, imaging, etc) from disparate health care digital data sources, can be used to produce integrated, higher level representations of critically ill patients for knowledge discovery and decision support for the 'next' patient. Vast amounts of digital health care data are available for real time computational analysis using artificial intelligence and statistical approaches such as data clustering and neural networks to ascertain relationships, determine 'diagnostic clusters' and trend outcomes of therapy in individual and groups of patients. While such algorithms have successful applications in business, industry, physical sciences and in parts of health care, several barriers exist for their broader application to intensive care medicine and other health care domains. Using AI and automated computational methodology we will develop algorithms for data mining raw medical data from disparate clinical data sources. This will enable understanding and  application of the most recent experiential information from large numbers of critically ill patients to find similarities between a current individual patient and historical, similar populations with known treatment outcomes. This will iteratively lead to a refined representation of the individual patient and guide patient management. This project is not merely the development of a database, although this is an essential precursor for the application of the advanced analytic techniques we will develop. It is ultimately about developing a framework to support the extraction, manipulation and construction of new views, relationships and information of and from observational clinical data from multiple sources to enable meaningful analysis and application at the patient's bedside. There are many open questions not sufficiently addressed about the translation of raw clinical data into an analytic computational infrastructure capable of providing bedside decision support. We will integrate expertise in medicine, computational mathematics and computer science to construct suitable data structures and develop AI computational techniques for analysis and presentation. Our goal is to advance the development of explicit methodology to bring analyzed comparative data to the bedside of critically ill children in real time to support clinical decision-making. Such a process will involve: 1.) transformation of patient-centric data across disparate platforms into a large relational database; 2.) construction of an integrated data model, assuring data integrity, structure and security; and finally, 3.) data analysis and presentation as meaningful comparative metrics that adequately characterize the time-based continuum of critical illness. Analytics can then be developed and algorithms refined that can be applied to severity of illness, prognostic, therapeutic, and anomaly detection in patients, hospital units, and national populations, thus painting a holistic picture of patients and populations. Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients. We will use advanced computational techniques and artificial intelligence to detect categories within raw medical data from disparate data sources allowing the most recent experiential information about large numbers of critically ill children to be mined to find similarities between the index case and historical cases with known outcomes. This will enable decision support for diagnosis, management, therapy and outcomes serving the functions of disease detection, direct patient care, quality, and safety.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients.

"Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Medical decision support tools are increasingly available on the Internet and are being used by lay persons as well as health care professionals. The goal of some of these tools is to provide an ""individualized"" prediction of future health care related events such as prognosis in breast cancer given specific information about the individual. These tools are usually based on models synthesized from data with a fine granularity of information. Under the umbrella of ""personalized"" medicine, these individualized prognostic assessments are sought as a means to replace general prognostic information given to patients with specific probability estimates that pertain to a small stratum to which the patient belongs, and ultimately specifically to each patient (i.e., a stratum with n=1). Subsequently, these estimates are used to inform decision making and are therefore of critical importance for public health.   Responsible utilization of prognostic models for patient counseling and medical decision making requires thorough model validation. Verification that the estimated or predicted event probabilities reflect the underlying true probability for a particular individual (i.e., verifying the calibration of the prognostic model) is a critical but often overlooked step in evaluation, which usually favors the verification of the discriminatory ability of the model. Selection of the best predictive model for a given problem should be based on robust comparison that takes into account errors in individual predictions, calibration, and discrimination indices. A robust test for comparison of calibration across different models does not currently exist.   Our specific aims are to: (1) Characterize the main deficiencies of existing calibration indices in the context of individualized predictions and develop a new model-independent calibration index and comparison test that can be used to assess and compare predictive models based on both statistical regression and machine earning methods; (2) Unify the theories on decomposition of error into discrimination and calibration components stemming from the statistical and machine learning communities to derive a refined measure of alteration that can be calculated from measures of error and discrimination. We will compare the performance of the new methods with existing ones in different predictive models derived from real clinical data related to different medical domains.          n/a",Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems,8142647,R01LM009520,"['Accounting', 'American', 'Area', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Discrimination', 'Entropy', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Indexes', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'indexing', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'statistics', 'stem', 'theories', 'tool']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2010,159993,0.0668389446610639
"A Novel Computational Framework for Individualized Clinical Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Personalized therapy requires innovative genome-scale studies for identifying expression patterns in disease progression. Since each individual feature selection algorithm has different strengths, hybrid models, combining multiple algorithms, have become necessary for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. Furthermore, it is important to reveal disease-mediated biomarker interactions, including feedback circuits, for more effective therapy. This proposal will develop a novel bioinformatics framework by combining genomics, proteomics, and clinical approaches for more informed clinical decision-making.       In Aim 1, we will develop a feature selection system by integrating multiple algorithms for biomarker identification. Combinations of several feature selection methods in different stages of gene filtering will be investigated. The optimal combination scheme for generating the highest prediction accuracy with the minimum number of biomarkers will be determined for several cancer types. The identified biomarkers will be validated by extensive public data sets. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology for modeling biomarker interaction patterns for clinical classification. Based on the expression profiles of the biomarkers selected in Aim 1, Dempster-Shafer belief networks will be employed for predicting individual clinical outcome. The network structure will elucidate molecular interactions among the biomarker proteins in disease progression. Algorithms will be developed to optimize the performance of the Dempster-Shafer network formalism. Different combination rules of Dempster-Shafer theory will be implemented in the belief networks to handle various real- life clinical applications. In Aim 3, stringent criteria will be applied to compare Dempster-Shafer networks with Bayesian networks and other machine learning methods, using the same data sets. The best molecular classifiers will be identified and evaluated with respect to traditional prognostic factors. This strategy will allow patient stratification based on risk of tumor recurrence and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. The biomarker interactions derived in Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks will be evaluated for providing useful biological insights. A web-based infrastructure for clinical decision-making will be developed and validated.       This project will focus on predicting metastasis and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. This multidisciplinary research will involve collaborations among bioinformaticians, clinicians, and biomedical researchers for algorithm development and evaluation with respect to strategies for biomarker- based patient stratification and assessment of therapeutic outcomes in different prognostic groups. The project results will be evaluated in prospective clinical trials for colorectal cancer treatment intervention. Our long-term goals are to identify biomarkers that reveal important molecular mechanisms and/or therapeutic targets underlying disease and to make accurate clinical predictions for personalized therapy. This study will advance the computational modeling of human genome data in disease for clinical decision-making.           Local and distant recurrence is the major cause of cancer-related deaths.

"DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY    Description (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Healthcare Data, 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions.    The lack of prescribing information and meaningful dosing guidance places an incredible burden on our pediatric caregivers with the end-result often the sub-optimal use of many medicines in children [1]. It is widely believed by the Institute of Medicine and American Association of Pediatrics that prescribing errors can be reduced via intelligent decision support systems that facilitate pharmacotherapy decision making [2]. We are developing drug-specific Pediatric Pharmacotherapy Decision Support Systems (PPDSS) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in an attempt to address these issues. Our goals for this system include the ability to: 1) provide dosing guidance consistent with formulary standard of care, 2) examine patient-specific pharmacotherapeutic indices with target agents relative to historical controls derived from the hospital data warehouse, 3) explore diagnoses - drug correlation in conjunction with utilization and 4) educate physicians on clinical pharmacologic principles specific to population and drug combinations of interest. Within this system, static compendial information (e.g., Lexi-Comp) can be searched, indexed and summarized for easy viewing; real-time, forecasting of relevant drug exposure or clinical markers (lab values, pharmacodynamics, adverse events) is made available based on interface to current patient data from our electronic medical records (EMR) system. Our long-term vision is to facilitate the safe and effective administration of drugs used in the treatment of children with an evolving collection of PPDSS providing improved management of patient pharmacotherapy.       The objective of this challenge grant application is to create a patient-based informatics system that contains the relevant guidance concerning dosing of specific agents to various pediatric subpopulations. This guidance will have the opportunity to grow (artificial intelligence) as patient diversity expands the historical experience (population priors) with an agent or combination of agents. This research application provides compelling evidence that clinical pharmacology driven decision support systems can interface with hospital EMR to provide individualized pharmacotherapy guidance. Our central hypothesis is that dosing guidance can be improved when the caregiver responsible for pharmacotherapy is informed in an expedient manner while in the process of patient care. The integration of well-characterized models that account for sources of variation in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and/or relationships with clinical outcomes is married with the most relevant clinical data associated with the management of a particular or combination of drug and disease states. The incoming clinical data streams can of course expand as new information becomes available (e.g., genomic data and guidance). Drug dashboards are designed for and by the physician therapeutic area in collaboration with Clinical Pharmacology and IT team members. Current prototype dashboards provide forecasting of drug exposure at select time points consistent with clinical protocols used to manage toxicity and efficacy. Forecasting tools permit dosing scenarios to be explored via a user-friendly interface that front-ends a pediatric population-based PK/PD model. By mobilizing the pediatric caregiver, clinical pharmacology and health IT sectors we envision a heightened appreciation for pharmacology-based decision support solutions and an evolving strategy to use such solutions to improve outcomes in children. The project brings together drug-specific decision support generated by our clinical pharmacology experts and clinical caregivers with predictive models generated by our pharmacometrics and informatics team. Drug dashboard prototypes for methotrexate (chemotherapeutic agent) and tacrolimus (used to prevent organ rejection) are under development and will be clinically evaluated prior to a production launch. The prediction engines and forecasting routines are transparent to the end-user; emphasis on clinical outcomes including reduced medication errors and length of hospital stay will be used to demonstrate the ROI for individual dashboards. Funding this application will ensure the generalizability of our data integration solution beyond CHOP boundaries, provide the appropriate test data to qualify/validate the prediction algorithms and generate the clinical experience with the PPDSS that will encourage other therapeutic areas and institutions to utilize the system. The solution (PPDSS dashboards and installation guidance) will be provided to all who request as part of our data-sharing plan.            Project Narrative The proposed research provides a mechanism to incorporate the most relevant prior knowledge into dosing guidance for an often understudied population - children. An important feature of the research is the incorporation of predictive models that provide real-time forecasting of patient response to existing therapy recommendations conditioned on prior patient experience with the potential to provide clinical scenario testing if the caregiver requests [3].

"Social Networks and Skilled Birth Attendance to Prevent Maternal Mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will investigate the influence of social networks on women's decisions to use skilled birth attendants (SBA) and the criteria used in these decisions. The study aims are to 1. Explore the utility of the Network Episode Model of Utilization (NEM) in explaining women's health service utilization decision-making in the context of a normal biological event and, 2. Test the predicative power of women's self identified decision-making criteria on choice of birth attendant in the event of an uncomplicated pregnancy and birth. The purpose is well aligned with the National Institute of Nursing's mission and area of research emphasis, promoting health and preventing disease. Worldwide an estimated 529,000 women die annually from pregnancy- and childbirth-related complications with a disproportionate number (99%) occurring in developing countries. Preventable and treatable conditions such as post-partum hemorrhage, sepsis, eclampsia and obstructed labor are the leading causes of maternal deaths worldwide. Use of a SBA to improve identification and management of these conditions is an effective means to reduce maternal mortality. However, SBA services remain underused even in settings where SBAs are available. To understand why women are using or not using SBAs during delivery, the study will employ the NEM to more fully test the influence of socio-structural context on decision making and deliniate the specific criteria used in decision-making through ethnographic decision tree modeling. The study will employ a retrospective, cross-sectional design. Face-to-face interviews using a structured interview instrument will be conducted with a representative sample of 254 women in Matlab, Bangladesh. This research will provide a model that can be used to investigate health care utilization decision-making in the context of prevention as well as illness response. The relevance to public health and the long term goal of the research is to reduce the high levels of maternal death and disability observed in vulnerable populations both in Bangladesh and the United States. The Healthy People 2010 Objective 16-4 and the United Nations Millennium Development Goal 5 have identified the reduction of maternal mortality as a public health priority.          n/a",Social Networks and Skilled Birth Attendance to Prevent Maternal Mortality,7749052,F31NR010650,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Back', 'Bangladesh', 'Behavioral Model', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Birth', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childbirth', 'Communities', 'Complication', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Developing Countries', 'Development', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Eclampsia', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ethnography', 'Event', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Healthy People 2010', 'Hemorrhage', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Maternal Mortality', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Nurses', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Prenatal care', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Health Services', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'RQ2', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Services', 'Social Network', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United Nations', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health Services', 'World Health Organization', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'disability', 'health care service utilization', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'member', 'network models', 'outreach', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health priorities', 'response', 'service utilization', 'social', 'success', 'theories', 'uptake']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2010,10918,0.07585094334969547
"Measuring real time decision-making about UVR Protection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of interventions to maximize consistency in ultraviolet radiation (UVR) protection rests on improved understanding of decision-making factors that contribute to daily variation in UVR protection. In this study, we use Ethnographic Decision Tree Modeling to examine decision-making regarding sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and UVR protection behavior in melanoma first-degree relatives (FDRs). In Phase I, we will generate the models via qualitative ethnographic interviews with 25 melanoma FDRs, and then will construct a composite decision-making model for each of the three UVR protection outcomes. In Phase II we will establish the validity of the models using ecological momentary assessment of UVR protection (over 14 summer days, at 1 pm and 5 pm daily) in 60 FDRs. We will recruit equal numbers of women and men, and equal numbers of those who perceive high and low advantages of tanning, given the importance of these predictors for UVR protection. Specific Aim I is to generate and establish the validity of the models explaining decision-making about three UVR protection behaviors (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, use of protective clothing) in melanoma FDRs, and Specific Aim II is to examine theory-driven affective and cognitive predictors of sun protection maintenance (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and use of sun protective clothing) assessed in real time. We adopt a theory-informed approach to decision-making, and so expect that the factors identified inductively in Phase I, as well as between- and within-subject variation in melanoma threat, efficacy beliefs, and satisfaction with UVR protection drawn from Witte's Extended Parallel Processing Model and Rothman's theory of health behavior maintenance will predict UVR protection behaviors. We will also examine gender and tanning attitudes as covariates of these effects. The study findings will increase our understanding of the decision- making context for behavioral maintenance of UVR protection, and dictate novel intervention strategies to reduce behavioral inconsistency - and increase behavioral maintenance - of UVR protection in those at high risk for melanoma. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine daily UVR protection and decision-making about protection in 60 first degree family members of melanoma patients who complete 14-day diaries via personal digital assistants and audio-taped narratives. We will employ qualitative and quantitative research strategies and determine between and within- person variability in UVR protection and decision-making that will inform the development of interventions to increase UVR protection maintenance among those who are at risk for melanoma.                    Narrative This study will examine daily UVR protection and decision-making about protection in 60 first degree family members of melanoma patients who complete 14-day diaries via personal digital assistants and audio-taped narratives.

"Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Advanced Computational Framework for Decision Support in Critically Ill Children This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10): Increasing Technology for Processing Health Care Data and specific Challenge Topic 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions. Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) and advanced computational techniques, applied to complex, multidimensional, streaming, clinical data (historic, physiologic, laboratory, imaging, etc) from disparate health care digital data sources, can be used to produce integrated, higher level representations of critically ill patients for knowledge discovery and decision support for the 'next' patient. Vast amounts of digital health care data are available for real time computational analysis using artificial intelligence and statistical approaches such as data clustering and neural networks to ascertain relationships, determine 'diagnostic clusters' and trend outcomes of therapy in individual and groups of patients. While such algorithms have successful applications in business, industry, physical sciences and in parts of health care, several barriers exist for their broader application to intensive care medicine and other health care domains. Using AI and automated computational methodology we will develop algorithms for data mining raw medical data from disparate clinical data sources. This will enable understanding and  application of the most recent experiential information from large numbers of critically ill patients to find similarities between a current individual patient and historical, similar populations with known treatment outcomes. This will iteratively lead to a refined representation of the individual patient and guide patient management. This project is not merely the development of a database, although this is an essential precursor for the application of the advanced analytic techniques we will develop. It is ultimately about developing a framework to support the extraction, manipulation and construction of new views, relationships and information of and from observational clinical data from multiple sources to enable meaningful analysis and application at the patient's bedside. There are many open questions not sufficiently addressed about the translation of raw clinical data into an analytic computational infrastructure capable of providing bedside decision support. We will integrate expertise in medicine, computational mathematics and computer science to construct suitable data structures and develop AI computational techniques for analysis and presentation. Our goal is to advance the development of explicit methodology to bring analyzed comparative data to the bedside of critically ill children in real time to support clinical decision-making. Such a process will involve: 1.) transformation of patient-centric data across disparate platforms into a large relational database; 2.) construction of an integrated data model, assuring data integrity, structure and security; and finally, 3.) data analysis and presentation as meaningful comparative metrics that adequately characterize the time-based continuum of critical illness. Analytics can then be developed and algorithms refined that can be applied to severity of illness, prognostic, therapeutic, and anomaly detection in patients, hospital units, and national populations, thus painting a holistic picture of patients and populations. Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients. We will use advanced computational techniques and artificial intelligence to detect categories within raw medical data from disparate data sources allowing the most recent experiential information about large numbers of critically ill children to be mined to find similarities between the index case and historical cases with known outcomes. This will enable decision support for diagnosis, management, therapy and outcomes serving the functions of disease detection, direct patient care, quality, and safety.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to provide an integrated high-level view of a patient compared to and in the context of previous critically ill patients.

"Decision Support in the Care of Preterm Newborns-Tool Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Even after many advances in ventilator management, prediction of extubation outcome for a mechanically ventilated premature infant with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) remains a challenging task for clinicians. We recently developed a machine-learned model (an Artificial Neural Network, ANN) to assist in decision- making regarding extubation of premature newborns (Mueller et al., 2004, 2006). The ANN model was found to perform with accuracy comparable to that of experienced clinicians; however, this approach needs to be compared to equally powerful machine-learning approaches before it can be evaluated in clinical practice. An appropriately validated decision-support tool could help in reducing the number of days a premature infant spends on a mechanical ventilator, and hence the risk of developing short and long-term side effects of mechanical ventilation, resulting in a corresponding decrease in overall health care costs.    In this R21 proposal, we will use several machine-learning approaches combined as a committee formation to obtain the best prediction of extubation success for a given infant. Further, we will build on the previously developed ANN prototype to create an enhanced decision support tool by developing data representation, storage, management, and most important, causal inference, which will enable effective integration of the resulting web-based decision-support tool with clinical practice. This last feature is only possible due to the integrated nature of the proponents themselves, which range from data structure and mathematical modeling experts to experienced neonatologists with a well established working relationship. The proposed effort aims at using advanced modeling tools for translational research by developing a web-based decision-support tool to aid primarily inexperienced clinicians in their decision-making and by promoting interoperability and data exchange among researchers in this field. The critical feature of this infrastructure is its web-based nature, which enables clinicians to evaluate a predictor's accuracy and parametric sensitivity individually for each neonate without having to use any other software than a web-browser. Such a prediction model will be of critical value not only to increase overall clinical accuracy but also to identify effective measures of validity of the original predictions.    The overall aim of this study is to develop a high performing web-based prediction system to use as a decision-support tool in clinical practice and to promote interoperability, and thus, data sharing and interaction among researchers in the neonatal community.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Predicting extubation outcome in premature infants on mechanical ventilators remains a challenging task even for experienced clinicians. In the proposed work, we aim to provide a sophisticated web-based tool that uses a machine-learning committee comprised of artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), naive Bayesian classifiers (NBC), influence diagrams (ID), boosted decision trees (BDT) and multivariable logistic regression (MLR) to assist primarily inexperienced clinicians in the decision-making. For the implementation of this tool we propose to develop an XML schema and RDFS model that can promote interoperability, and thus, data sharing and interaction among researchers in the neonatal community.          n/a",Decision Support in the Care of Preterm Newborns-Tool Development,7665362,R21HL090598,"['Adverse effects', 'Arts', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Committee Members', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Health Care Costs', 'Infant', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Ventilators', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Premature Infant', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'System', 'Translational Research', 'Ventilator', 'Work', 'caregiving', 'clinical practice', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'experience', 'interoperability', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'neonate', 'premature', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'routine care', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web based interface']",NHLBI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2009,185389,0.10729199813967079
"Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Medical decision support tools are increasingly available on the Internet and are being used by lay persons as well as health care professionals. The goal of some of these tools is to provide an ""individualized"" prediction of future health care related events such as prognosis in breast cancer given specific information about the individual. These tools are usually based on models synthesized from data with a fine granularity of information. Under the umbrella of ""personalized"" medicine, these individualized prognostic assessments are sought as a means to replace general prognostic information given to patients with specific probability estimates that pertain to a small stratum to which the patient belongs, and ultimately specifically to each patient (i.e., a stratum with n=1). Subsequently, these estimates are used to inform decision making and are therefore of critical importance for public health.   Responsible utilization of prognostic models for patient counseling and medical decision making requires thorough model validation. Verification that the estimated or predicted event probabilities reflect the underlying true probability for a particular individual (i.e., verifying the calibration of the prognostic model) is a critical but often overlooked step in evaluation, which usually favors the verification of the discriminatory ability of the model. Selection of the best predictive model for a given problem should be based on robust comparison that takes into account errors in individual predictions, calibration, and discrimination indices. A robust test for comparison of calibration across different models does not currently exist.   Our specific aims are to: (1) Characterize the main deficiencies of existing calibration indices in the context of individualized predictions and develop a new model-independent calibration index and comparison test that can be used to assess and compare predictive models based on both statistical regression and machine earning methods; (2) Unify the theories on decomposition of error into discrimination and calibration components stemming from the statistical and machine learning communities to derive a refined measure of alteration that can be calculated from measures of error and discrimination.

"A Novel Computational Framework for Individualized Clinical Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Personalized therapy requires innovative genome-scale studies for identifying expression patterns in disease progression. Since each individual feature selection algorithm has different strengths, hybrid models, combining multiple algorithms, have become necessary for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. Furthermore, it is important to reveal disease-mediated biomarker interactions, including feedback circuits, for more effective therapy. This proposal will develop a novel bioinformatics framework by combining genomics, proteomics, and clinical approaches for more informed clinical decision-making.       In Aim 1, we will develop a feature selection system by integrating multiple algorithms for biomarker identification. Combinations of several feature selection methods in different stages of gene filtering will be investigated. The optimal combination scheme for generating the highest prediction accuracy with the minimum number of biomarkers will be determined for several cancer types. The identified biomarkers will be validated by extensive public data sets. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology for modeling biomarker interaction patterns for clinical classification. Based on the expression profiles of the biomarkers selected in Aim 1, Dempster-Shafer belief networks will be employed for predicting individual clinical outcome. The network structure will elucidate molecular interactions among the biomarker proteins in disease progression. Algorithms will be developed to optimize the performance of the Dempster-Shafer network formalism. Different combination rules of Dempster-Shafer theory will be implemented in the belief networks to handle various real- life clinical applications. In Aim 3, stringent criteria will be applied to compare Dempster-Shafer networks with Bayesian networks and other machine learning methods, using the same data sets. The best molecular classifiers will be identified and evaluated with respect to traditional prognostic factors. This strategy will allow patient stratification based on risk of tumor recurrence and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. The biomarker interactions derived in Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks will be evaluated for providing useful biological insights. A web-based infrastructure for clinical decision-making will be developed and validated.       This project will focus on predicting metastasis and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. This multidisciplinary research will involve collaborations among bioinformaticians, clinicians, and biomedical researchers for algorithm development and evaluation with respect to strategies for biomarker- based patient stratification and assessment of therapeutic outcomes in different prognostic groups. The project results will be evaluated in prospective clinical trials for colorectal cancer treatment intervention. Our long-term goals are to identify biomarkers that reveal important molecular mechanisms and/or therapeutic targets underlying disease and to make accurate clinical predictions for personalized therapy. This study will advance the computational modeling of human genome data in disease for clinical decision-making.           Local and distant recurrence is the major cause of cancer-related deaths.

"DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY    Description (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (10) Information Technology for Processing Healthcare Data, 10-LM-102: Advanced decision support for complex clinical decisions.    The lack of prescribing information and meaningful dosing guidance places an incredible burden on our pediatric caregivers with the end-result often the sub-optimal use of many medicines in children [1]. It is widely believed by the Institute of Medicine and American Association of Pediatrics that prescribing errors can be reduced via intelligent decision support systems that facilitate pharmacotherapy decision making [2]. We are developing drug-specific Pediatric Pharmacotherapy Decision Support Systems (PPDSS) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) in an attempt to address these issues. Our goals for this system include the ability to: 1) provide dosing guidance consistent with formulary standard of care, 2) examine patient-specific pharmacotherapeutic indices with target agents relative to historical controls derived from the hospital data warehouse, 3) explore diagnoses - drug correlation in conjunction with utilization and 4) educate physicians on clinical pharmacologic principles specific to population and drug combinations of interest. Within this system, static compendial information (e.g., Lexi-Comp) can be searched, indexed and summarized for easy viewing; real-time, forecasting of relevant drug exposure or clinical markers (lab values, pharmacodynamics, adverse events) is made available based on interface to current patient data from our electronic medical records (EMR) system. Our long-term vision is to facilitate the safe and effective administration of drugs used in the treatment of children with an evolving collection of PPDSS providing improved management of patient pharmacotherapy.       The objective of this challenge grant application is to create a patient-based informatics system that contains the relevant guidance concerning dosing of specific agents to various pediatric subpopulations. This guidance will have the opportunity to grow (artificial intelligence) as patient diversity expands the historical experience (population priors) with an agent or combination of agents. This research application provides compelling evidence that clinical pharmacology driven decision support systems can interface with hospital EMR to provide individualized pharmacotherapy guidance. Our central hypothesis is that dosing guidance can be improved when the caregiver responsible for pharmacotherapy is informed in an expedient manner while in the process of patient care. The integration of well-characterized models that account for sources of variation in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and/or relationships with clinical outcomes is married with the most relevant clinical data associated with the management of a particular or combination of drug and disease states. The incoming clinical data streams can of course expand as new information becomes available (e.g., genomic data and guidance). Drug dashboards are designed for and by the physician therapeutic area in collaboration with Clinical Pharmacology and IT team members. Current prototype dashboards provide forecasting of drug exposure at select time points consistent with clinical protocols used to manage toxicity and efficacy. Forecasting tools permit dosing scenarios to be explored via a user-friendly interface that front-ends a pediatric population-based PK/PD model. By mobilizing the pediatric caregiver, clinical pharmacology and health IT sectors we envision a heightened appreciation for pharmacology-based decision support solutions and an evolving strategy to use such solutions to improve outcomes in children. The project brings together drug-specific decision support generated by our clinical pharmacology experts and clinical caregivers with predictive models generated by our pharmacometrics and informatics team. Drug dashboard prototypes for methotrexate (chemotherapeutic agent) and tacrolimus (used to prevent organ rejection) are under development and will be clinically evaluated prior to a production launch. The prediction engines and forecasting routines are transparent to the end-user; emphasis on clinical outcomes including reduced medication errors and length of hospital stay will be used to demonstrate the ROI for individual dashboards. Funding this application will ensure the generalizability of our data integration solution beyond CHOP boundaries, provide the appropriate test data to qualify/validate the prediction algorithms and generate the clinical experience with the PPDSS that will encourage other therapeutic areas and institutions to utilize the system. The solution (PPDSS dashboards and installation guidance) will be provided to all who request as part of our data-sharing plan.            Project Narrative The proposed research provides a mechanism to incorporate the most relevant prior knowledge into dosing guidance for an often understudied population - children. An important feature of the research is the incorporation of predictive models that provide real-time forecasting of patient response to existing therapy recommendations conditioned on prior patient experience with the potential to provide clinical scenario testing if the caregiver requests [3]. The initial dashboards developed as part of this proposal can easily be extended to accommodate other populations (elderly, pregnancy, etc) and expanded to include participation from additional caregiver stakeholders, clinical pharmacologists, bioinformatics scientists and pharmacometricians.",DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM TO GUIDE PEDIATRIC PHARMACOTHERAPY,7825111,RC1LM010367,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Pharmacology', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Drug Utilization', 'Drug usage', 'Elderly', 'Ensure', 'Formularies', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospital Formularies', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Maps', 'Medication Errors', 'Medicine', 'Methotrexate', 'Modeling', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Process', 'Production', 'Qualifying', 'Quality Control', 'Reaction', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Solutions', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Tacrolimus', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'community planning', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'member', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'response', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,RC1,2009,494693,0.04848038340572533
"Social Networks and Skilled Birth Attendance to Prevent Maternal Mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will investigate the influence of social networks on women's decisions to use skilled birth attendants (SBA) and the criteria used in these decisions. The study aims are to 1. Explore the utility of the Network Episode Model of Utilization (NEM) in explaining women's health service utilization decision-making in the context of a normal biological event and, 2. Test the predicative power of women's self identified decision-making criteria on choice of birth attendant in the event of an uncomplicated pregnancy and birth. The purpose is well aligned with the National Institute of Nursing's mission and area of research emphasis, promoting health and preventing disease. Worldwide an estimated 529,000 women die annually from pregnancy- and childbirth-related complications with a disproportionate number (99%) occurring in developing countries. Preventable and treatable conditions such as post-partum hemorrhage, sepsis, eclampsia and obstructed labor are the leading causes of maternal deaths worldwide. Use of a SBA to improve identification and management of these conditions is an effective means to reduce maternal mortality. However, SBA services remain underused even in settings where SBAs are available. To understand why women are using or not using SBAs during delivery, the study will employ the NEM to more fully test the influence of socio-structural context on decision making and deliniate the specific criteria used in decision-making through ethnographic decision tree modeling. The study will employ a retrospective, cross-sectional design. Face-to-face interviews using a structured interview instrument will be conducted with a representative sample of 254 women in Matlab, Bangladesh. This research will provide a model that can be used to investigate health care utilization decision-making in the context of prevention as well as illness response.

"Measuring real time decision-making about UVR Protection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The development of interventions to maximize consistency in ultraviolet radiation (UVR) protection rests on improved understanding of decision-making factors that contribute to daily variation in UVR protection. In this study, we use Ethnographic Decision Tree Modeling to examine decision-making regarding sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and UVR protection behavior in melanoma first-degree relatives (FDRs). In Phase I, we will generate the models via qualitative ethnographic interviews with 25 melanoma FDRs, and then will construct a composite decision-making model for each of the three UVR protection outcomes. In Phase II we will establish the validity of the models using ecological momentary assessment of UVR protection (over 14 summer days, at 1 pm and 5 pm daily) in 60 FDRs. We will recruit equal numbers of women and men, and equal numbers of those who perceive high and low advantages of tanning, given the importance of these predictors for UVR protection. Specific Aim I is to generate and establish the validity of the models explaining decision-making about three UVR protection behaviors (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, use of protective clothing) in melanoma FDRs, and Specific Aim II is to examine theory-driven affective and cognitive predictors of sun protection maintenance (sunscreen use, shade-seeking, and use of sun protective clothing) assessed in real time. We adopt a theory-informed approach to decision-making, and so expect that the factors identified inductively in Phase I, as well as between- and within-subject variation in melanoma threat, efficacy beliefs, and satisfaction with UVR protection drawn from Witte's Extended Parallel Processing Model and Rothman's theory of health behavior maintenance will predict UVR protection behaviors. We will also examine gender and tanning attitudes as covariates of these effects. The study findings will increase our understanding of the decision- making context for behavioral maintenance of UVR protection, and dictate novel intervention strategies to reduce behavioral inconsistency - and increase behavioral maintenance - of UVR protection in those at high risk for melanoma. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine daily UVR protection and decision-making about protection in 60 first degree family members of melanoma patients who complete 14-day diaries via personal digital assistants and audio-taped narratives. We will employ qualitative and quantitative research strategies and determine between and within- person variability in UVR protection and decision-making that will inform the development of interventions to increase UVR protection maintenance among those who are at risk for melanoma.                    Narrative This study will examine daily UVR protection and decision-making about protection in 60 first degree family members of melanoma patients who complete 14-day diaries via personal digital assistants and audio-taped narratives.

"Decision Support in the Care of Preterm Newborns-Tool Development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Even after many advances in ventilator management, prediction of extubation outcome for a mechanically ventilated premature infant with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) remains a challenging task for clinicians. We recently developed a machine-learned model (an Artificial Neural Network, ANN) to assist in decision- making regarding extubation of premature newborns (Mueller et al., 2004, 2006). The ANN model was found to perform with accuracy comparable to that of experienced clinicians; however, this approach needs to be compared to equally powerful machine-learning approaches before it can be evaluated in clinical practice. An appropriately validated decision-support tool could help in reducing the number of days a premature infant spends on a mechanical ventilator, and hence the risk of developing short and long-term side effects of mechanical ventilation, resulting in a corresponding decrease in overall health care costs.    In this R21 proposal, we will use several machine-learning approaches combined as a committee formation to obtain the best prediction of extubation success for a given infant. Further, we will build on the previously developed ANN prototype to create an enhanced decision support tool by developing data representation, storage, management, and most important, causal inference, which will enable effective integration of the resulting web-based decision-support tool with clinical practice. This last feature is only possible due to the integrated nature of the proponents themselves, which range from data structure and mathematical modeling experts to experienced neonatologists with a well established working relationship. The proposed effort aims at using advanced modeling tools for translational research by developing a web-based decision-support tool to aid primarily inexperienced clinicians in their decision-making and by promoting interoperability and data exchange among researchers in this field. The critical feature of this infrastructure is its web-based nature, which enables clinicians to evaluate a predictor's accuracy and parametric sensitivity individually for each neonate without having to use any other software than a web-browser. Such a prediction model will be of critical value not only to increase overall clinical accuracy but also to identify effective measures of validity of the original predictions.    The overall aim of this study is to develop a high performing web-based prediction system to use as a decision-support tool in clinical practice and to promote interoperability, and thus, data sharing and interaction among researchers in the neonatal community.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Predicting extubation outcome in premature infants on mechanical ventilators remains a challenging task even for experienced clinicians. In the proposed work, we aim to provide a sophisticated web-based tool that uses a machine-learning committee comprised of artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), naive Bayesian classifiers (NBC), influence diagrams (ID), boosted decision trees (BDT) and multivariable logistic regression (MLR) to assist primarily inexperienced clinicians in the decision-making. For the implementation of this tool we propose to develop an XML schema and RDFS model that can promote interoperability, and thus, data sharing and interaction among researchers in the neonatal community.          n/a",Decision Support in the Care of Preterm Newborns-Tool Development,7530584,R21HL090598,"['Adverse effects', 'Arts', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Committee Members', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Health Care Costs', 'Infant', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Ventilators', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Newborn Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health', 'Purpose', 'Range', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'System', 'Translational Research', 'Ventilator', 'Work', 'caregiving', 'data mining', 'data structure', 'day', 'experience', 'interoperability', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'neonate', 'prototype', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web based interface']",NHLBI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2008,234220,0.10729199813967079
"Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Medical decision support tools are increasingly available on the Internet and are being used by lay persons as well as health care professionals. The goal of some of these tools is to provide an ""individualized"" prediction of future health care related events such as prognosis in breast cancer given specific information about the individual. These tools are usually based on models synthesized from data with a fine granularity of information. Under the umbrella of ""personalized"" medicine, these individualized prognostic assessments are sought as a means to replace general prognostic information given to patients with specific probability estimates that pertain to a small stratum to which the patient belongs, and ultimately specifically to each patient (i.e., a stratum with n=1). Subsequently, these estimates are used to inform decision making and are therefore of critical importance for public health.   Responsible utilization of prognostic models for patient counseling and medical decision making requires thorough model validation. Verification that the estimated or predicted event probabilities reflect the underlying true probability for a particular individual (i.e., verifying the calibration of the prognostic model) is a critical but often overlooked step in evaluation, which usually favors the verification of the discriminatory ability of the model. Selection of the best predictive model for a given problem should be based on robust comparison that takes into account errors in individual predictions, calibration, and discrimination indices. A robust test for comparison of calibration across different models does not currently exist.   Our specific aims are to: (1) Characterize the main deficiencies of existing calibration indices in the context of individualized predictions and develop a new model-independent calibration index and comparison test that can be used to assess and compare predictive models based on both statistical regression and machine earning methods; (2) Unify the theories on decomposition of error into discrimination and calibration components stemming from the statistical and machine learning communities to derive a refined measure of alteration that can be calculated from measures of error and discrimination. We will compare the performance of the new methods with existing ones in different predictive models derived from real clinical data related to different medical domains.          n/a",Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems,7435263,R01LM009520,"['Accounting', 'American', 'Area', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Calibration', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Discrimination', 'Entropy', 'Evaluation', 'Evaluation Indexes', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Facility Construction Funding Category', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Logistic Models', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Numbers', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Regression Analysis', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Site', 'System', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'base', 'computer based statistical methods', 'indexing', 'interest', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'statistics', 'stem', 'theories', 'tool']",NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2008,373392,0.0668389446610639
"A Novel Computational Framework for Individualized Clinical Decision-Making    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Personalized therapy requires innovative genome-scale studies for identifying expression patterns in disease progression. Since each individual feature selection algorithm has different strengths, hybrid models, combining multiple algorithms, have become necessary for identifying clinically relevant biomarkers. Furthermore, it is important to reveal disease-mediated biomarker interactions, including feedback circuits, for more effective therapy. This proposal will develop a novel bioinformatics framework by combining genomics, proteomics, and clinical approaches for more informed clinical decision-making.       In Aim 1, we will develop a feature selection system by integrating multiple algorithms for biomarker identification. Combinations of several feature selection methods in different stages of gene filtering will be investigated. The optimal combination scheme for generating the highest prediction accuracy with the minimum number of biomarkers will be determined for several cancer types. The identified biomarkers will be validated by extensive public data sets. In Aim 2, we will develop a novel methodology for modeling biomarker interaction patterns for clinical classification. Based on the expression profiles of the biomarkers selected in Aim 1, Dempster-Shafer belief networks will be employed for predicting individual clinical outcome. The network structure will elucidate molecular interactions among the biomarker proteins in disease progression. Algorithms will be developed to optimize the performance of the Dempster-Shafer network formalism. Different combination rules of Dempster-Shafer theory will be implemented in the belief networks to handle various real- life clinical applications. In Aim 3, stringent criteria will be applied to compare Dempster-Shafer networks with Bayesian networks and other machine learning methods, using the same data sets. The best molecular classifiers will be identified and evaluated with respect to traditional prognostic factors. This strategy will allow patient stratification based on risk of tumor recurrence and the need for adjuvant chemotherapy. The biomarker interactions derived in Dempster-Shafer networks and Bayesian networks will be evaluated for providing useful biological insights. A web-based infrastructure for clinical decision-making will be developed and validated.       This project will focus on predicting metastasis and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer. This multidisciplinary research will involve collaborations among bioinformaticians, clinicians, and biomedical researchers for algorithm development and evaluation with respect to strategies for biomarker- based patient stratification and assessment of therapeutic outcomes in different prognostic groups. The project results will be evaluated in prospective clinical trials for colorectal cancer treatment intervention. Our long-term goals are to identify biomarkers that reveal important molecular mechanisms and/or therapeutic targets underlying disease and to make accurate clinical predictions for personalized therapy. This study will advance the computational modeling of human genome data in disease for clinical decision-making.           Local and distant recurrence is the major cause of cancer-related deaths.

"Computer Assisted Trauma Triage (CATT)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rapid and accurate triage is essential when dealing with acutely injured persons. To that end, a number of trauma triage decision aids have been proposed. Unfortunately, mistriage rates for trauma patients remain high, due in part to aids that lack precision or discrimination, are not used, or are misused or misapplied. Improving the trauma triage process is an important problem because doing so improves trauma triage outcomes by optimizing access to and utilization of specialized resources as well as reducing morbidity and mortality. A promising method for improving this process is to integrate machine learning algorithms as a rapid and accurate clinical decision support technique. Machine learning techniques have been used to develop rules to diagnosis myocardial infarction and to provide rapid and accurate decision support in nonmedical settings. They have also been used to predict mortality following injury. Furthermore, using machine learning algorithms for clinical decision support employs highly accurate predictive models to counter the previously mentioned pitfalls of existing trauma decision aids in the following ways: (1) collecting relevant readily available clinical information, (2) choosing the most accurate predictive model for the situation at hand, and (3) utilizing computational speed and power to optimize predictive accuracy. The goal of this AREA proposal is to test the feasibility of machine learning-based predictive modeling techniques to support trauma triage. We plan to use well-established predictive model development and evaluation techniques to: (1) Compare the existing American College of Surgeons trauma triage decision aid to four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques; (2) Compare the performance of four different machine learning predictive modeling techniques with and without a novel measure of change in physiological status; and (3) Compare the performance of full machine learning models to those derived using information gathered as a byproduct of the workflow. Models will predict persons with severe injury or need for specialized trauma resources.

"Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Medical decision support tools are increasingly available on the Internet and are being used by lay persons as well as health care professionals. The goal of some of these tools is to provide an ""individualized"" prediction of future health care related events such as prognosis in breast cancer given specific information about the individual. These tools are usually based on models synthesized from data with a fine granularity of information. Under the umbrella of ""personalized"" medicine, these individualized prognostic assessments are sought as a means to replace general prognostic information given to patients with specific probability estimates that pertain to a small stratum to which the patient belongs, and ultimately specifically to each patient (i.e., a stratum with n=1). Subsequently, these estimates are used to inform decision making and are therefore of critical importance for public health.   Responsible utilization of prognostic models for patient counseling and medical decision making requires thorough model validation. Verification that the estimated or predicted event probabilities reflect the underlying true probability for a particular individual (i.e., verifying the calibration of the prognostic model) is a critical but often overlooked step in evaluation, which usually favors the verification of the discriminatory ability of the model. Selection of the best predictive model for a given problem should be based on robust comparison that takes into account errors in individual predictions, calibration, and discrimination indices. A robust test for comparison of calibration across different models does not currently exist.   Our specific aims are to: (1) Characterize the main deficiencies of existing calibration indices in the context of individualized predictions and develop a new model-independent calibration index and comparison test that can be used to assess and compare predictive models based on both statistical regression and machine earning methods; (2) Unify the theories on decomposition of error into discrimination and calibration components stemming from the statistical and machine learning communities to derive a refined measure of alteration that can be calculated from measures of error and discrimination. We will compare the performance of the new methods with existing ones in different predictive models derived from real clinical data related to different medical domains.          n/a",Assessing quality of individual predictions in medical decision support systems,7245581,R01LM009520,[' '],NLM,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2007,380625,0.0668389446610639

"Intelligent Tutor for WMD EMS Incident Management    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to develop EMS/IM ITS, a suite of simulation-based intelligent tutoring systems and scenarios that will enable practice-based learning of WMD emergency medical services incident management principles and skills, including situation assessment, decision-making, and real-time execution of EMS tasks within an incident command structure. To support practical and economical development of many EMS/IM ITS training scenarios, we will also develop software tools and development methods that enable efficient authoring of new scenarios and adaptation/enhancement of existing scenarios by instructors or subject matter experts, without programming. We will leverage our tutoring system development tools and our experience developing tutoring systems for medical training, command and control, and tactical decision-making. The National Incident Management System (NIMS) was mandated by HSPD-5 to provide a comprehensive, national approach to domestic incident management, so that all levels of government across the nation could work efficiently and effectively together to prepare for, respond to, and recover from domestic incidents. We believe that EMS/IM ITS can contribute to NIMS by providing scenario-based learning of incident management principles for medical first responders, consistent with NIMS, and tailorable via scenario authoring to the specific circumstances and incident management plans of each government organization. This proposed Phase I effort will lay the groundwork for the Phase II effort, by producing 1) requirements and design of the system to be developed during Phase II, 2) a software prototype that illustrates our concept, and 3) a formative evaluation of the prototype and design that provides a basis for estimating the feasibility and effectiveness of the operational system that would be developed during Phase II.             n/a",Intelligent Tutor for WMD EMS Incident Management,7115108,R43ES014801,"['artificial intelligence', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer assisted medical decision making', 'computer assisted patient care', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'educational resource design /development', 'emergency service /first responder', 'health care personnel education', 'health care professional practice', 'health services research tag', 'medical education', 'method development', 'patient care management', 'training']",NIEHS,"STOTTLER HENKE ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2006,99999,0.029023298541037756

"Proteomics processing using networked instrument router* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Real-time, distributed decision-making and data-processing has become necessary as high-throughput proteomics across geographic boundaries becomes more mature. The most common instrument used to characterize and analyze proteins is the Mass Spectrometer. As more Mass Spectrometers are used in parallel to create a high-throughput proteomics system, the data processing needs grow exponentially. Using a cluster of low-cost instrument routers, developed at Userspace Corporation, the goal for this project is to divide the data processing tasks into a decision tree, which converts sequential tasking into parallel tasking or multi-threaded algorithms. These instruments can be controlled and the algorithms can independently process data in parallel or offline as they emerge in large data sets from one or many Mass Spectrometers. The First Phase of study will use an LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectroscopy) system that uses the ICAT (Isotope Coded Affinity Tags) technology developed at the lab of Dr. Ruedi Aebersold at the University of Washington (who is also the co-founder of the Institute for Systems Biology: ISB). The data from the Mass Spectrometers is analyzed using the COMET algorithm, also developed at the ISB. Userspace Corporation and ISB are collaborating on using Userspace's routers and framework in its Proteomics lab.      The first phase of this project will evaluate technologies and configuration required to process Mass Spectrometry data at the instrument level using a distributed network of the Userspace wireless instrument routers. The data will be processed in real-time as it becomes available to the router cluster and a rule-based decision matrix. The duration of this phase will be six months. The next phases would involve improving the data formatting, so that publication and data mining become science-centric and in a standardized XML (eXtensible Markup Language) representation.

"Actuarial Generation of Diagnostic Possibilities in Ment  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The primary goal of this Phase I project is to test the feasibility of a computerized diagnostic tool for collaborative assessment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents.  Such a system is sorely needed in both clinical and research settings because (a) structured clinical interviews, although the gold standard in diagnosis, are time consuming and underutilized, and (b) the clinical judgment that is often substituted is of Limited accuracy and subject to several significant biases.  Using the diagnostic rules from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), the proposed product will provide clinicians with automated actuarial symptom and diagnostic data thereby circumventing these limitations while assisting the collaborative diagnostic process.  These goals will be accomplished by integrating a reliable and valid symptom checklist filled out by patient informants with an advanced rule-based documentation system that employs an established logic-processing engine and which utilizes the complete DSM-IV rule set.  Based on the presence and severity of discrete symptoms, clinicians will be provided with actuarially derived probability values that indicate the likelihood of specific DSM-IV criteria or disorders.  Additionally, it will facilitate rapid and complete documentation DSM-IV criterion necessary to formally validate or refute diagnoses.  The improved integration of client and clinician information will provide increased diagnostic precision and facilitate collaboration between providers and clients.  In Phase II, the system will be extended to support repeated assessment, direct access via the World Wide Web, and larger sampling to collect further psychometric information.  Phase I objectives include: 1. To produce a highly usable collaborative diagnostic assessment tool that will be used by individual practitioners, small group practices and their clients.  2. To automate the determination of the positive and negative predictive power of informant symptom data for corresponding DSM-IV criterion and diagnoses, and to collect an initial data set to evaluate usability and psychometric properties of the system.  Phase II objectives include: (1) creation of a user interfaces and program logic to support repeated assessment (2) scaling to provide direct access via the World Wide Web and (3) larger sampling to extend the known psychometric properties of the system.

A working prototype of the diagnostic rules in the American              Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV) uses and          artificial intelligence engine (""XSB"") to implement the logic of DSM-IV along        with and an interactive graphical user interface to allow a user to add              information and understand conclusions reached by the system. The Phase I            programming objectives are to make Diagnostica ready for commercial use by           improving its graphical user interface, and finalizing implementation of its         logical rules. The resulting system will be a practical tool in clinical             settings, and relies on computer science innovations that have preciously            neither been explored nor applied in the domain of medical reasoning. With the       emergence of decision support systems, the need for better quality diagnostic        information is becoming increasingly apparent. This has been due, in part, to        the complexity of diagnostic processes and the emphasis on support of financial      processes. Within mental health, the DSM-IV provides both a model and a              standard for making diagnoses. A software component that provides flexible,          complete, and efficient application of this standard is of great value. The          innovation of Diagnostica relies on the sophistication of its modeling of            DSM-IV rules, and it's flexibility in applying those rules. Diagnostica will         automatically track the status of the information entered and allow users to         tie up 'loose ends' in documenting the proof of diagnoses formally. AS example,      the user may indicate that a set of diagnoses in 'believed true' without             specifying the symptoms needed to make the diagnoses formally ( a procedure          used routinely in clinical practice). the application will track whatever            'residual' data this is necessary in order to complete formal diagnoses, while       leaving the option of when, or if, to complete the process up to the user.                                                                                                Phase II objectives include: (1) extending Diagnostica to provide other              software applications needing diagnostic decision support services, and              specifically to link Diagnostica to the World Health Organization Schedules for      Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN); (2) addressing logical modeling       of time and creating an effective user interface for repeated assessment; (3)        incorporating probabilistic information about sets of symptoms based on              empirical information initially obtained in Phase I; and (4) developing and          testing ""belief revision"" functions to changes in knowledge stemming from            repeated clinical assessment.

"DECISION SUPPORT SOFTWARE TO TRIAGE FOR SKIN CANCER Many primary care physicians are unable to proficiently triage skin lesions suspicious for cancer, compromising patients' health. Decision support software could help in the early detection of skin cancer, decreasing morbidity and mortality related to skin cancer misdiagnoses. It also could reduce unnecessary referrals to specialists, lowering health care costs. In Phase I, we demonstrated that decision support software can significantly improve physicians' ability to arrive at appropriate triage decisions for a variety skin lesions, including cancerous lesions. In Phase II, we propose to l) expand the decision support software to triage for pigmented lesions and a wider range of nonpigmented skin lesions; 2) incorporate case-based reasoning methods into the software to enable users to conduct a confidence check on their final triage decision and to help them make the correct decision at each branch point in the decision tree; 3) develop a teaching application based on the decision tree; 4) enable the software to produce for patients individualized information on skin cancer prevention and treatment; 5) interface the decision support software with the computerized patient medical record; and 6) test the effectiveness, utility, and feasibility of the decision support software with a sample of primary care physicians and patients. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: This research is designed to produce comprehensive decision support software that will be a commercially viable product. Two large potential markets for this product are medical schools, which may use the software as a teaching aid, and medical settings, which may use the software as a clinical tool for practicing primary care physicians.  n/a",DECISION SUPPORT SOFTWARE TO TRIAGE FOR SKIN CANCER,6172710,R44CA075906,"['cancer information system', ' cancer prevention', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' medical records', ' melanoma', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' neoplasm /cancer therapy', ' pigments', ' skin neoplasms']",NCI,WEST PORTAL SOFTWARE CORPORATION,R44,2000,329958,0.08779997153487475
"DECISION ANALYTIC SUPPORT FOR CLINICAL GUIDELINES DESCRIPTION (Taken from application abstract):  In the rapidly changing          health care environment the increasing prominence of managed care has            prompted a greater reliance on formal clinical guidelines to suppose             clinical decisions.  Guidelines have been advocated with increasing              frequency to reduce inappropriate care, control geographic variations in         practice patterns and make more effective use of health care resources.          However, guidelines often have little impact on clinical practice because        physicians are unaware of them, lack confidence in them because the              justification for their recommendations is not clear or because they are         inaccessible at the time of patient care or difficult to apply.  Guidelines      also quickly become out of date as new research data becomes available.                                                                                           In order to enhance the quality and usefulness of clinical guidelines, the       general goal of this project is to develop, deploy and evaluate interactive      computer based guidelines, supported by an integrated decision theoretic         model and a linked knowledge base.  This arrangement will use patient            characteristics to tailor guideline advice to the individual patient.  The       integrated decision model will provide recommendations for situations not        addressed by the guideline and also will help to justify guideline               recommendations by calculating the effectiveness and costs of various            strategies.  The proposed system also contains links to a knowledge base         containing the sources of data used in the guideline and the model, so that      physicians using the system can examine the studies supporting the guideline     recommendations.  Natural language explanations, generated automatically         based on the structure of the decision model and the guideline will justify      the recommendations.  A query capability will enable physicians to look up       specific data from the knowledge base.  The linked knowledge based also          ensures that the supported decision model and guideline will be updated          automatically as new research data is published.                                                                                                                  The computer system will be used to implement an interactive version of the      Guidelines for Medical Treatment for Stroke Prevention, developed by the         American College of Physicians.  The system will be bench tested using a         series of cases abstracted from the General Medicine practice at the Robert      Wood Johnson Medical School.  Faculty and house staff internists will serve      as research subjects to perform a field trial of the system.  This will          include the extent of previous compliance with the guideline, pre and            post-testing of medical knowledge pertinent to the guideline, and the degree     to which the computer-based guideline changes behavior compared to the           traditional guideline format.  A decision theoretic measure of potential         benefit will be calculated by comparing decision model evaluations of            physicians' unaided choices with those recommended by the guideline system.       n/a",DECISION ANALYTIC SUPPORT FOR CLINICAL GUIDELINES,6185218,R01LM006321,"['Internet', ' artificial intelligence', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted medical decision making', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' human data', ' human subject', ' information systems', ' medical records', ' physicians', ' questionnaires', ' stroke']",NLM,UNIV OF MED/DENT NJ-R W JOHNSON MED SCH,R01,2000,248558,0.04098258220963174

"Creating an initial ethics framework for biomedical data modeling by mapping and exploring key decision points Project Summary Biomedical data science data modeling is relevant to a plethora of informatics research activities, such as natural language processing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and predictive analytics. As Electronic Health Record systems become more advanced and more mature, with the potential to incorporate a wide and diverse array of data from genomics to mobile health (mHealth) applications, the scope and nature of the biomedical data science questions researchers ask become broader. Concomitantly, the answers to their questions have the potential to impact the care of millions of patients—getting the answers right, proactively, is high stakes. However, in data modeling currently, there is no bioethics framework to guide the process of mapping key decision points and recording the rationale for choices made. Making data modeling decision points, as well as the reasoning behind them, explicit would have a twofold impact on improving biomedical data science by: 1. Enhancing transparency and reproducibility and maximizing the value of data science research and 2. Supporting the ability to assess decision points and rationales in terms of their most crucial ethical ramifications. Research in this area is particularly timely amid the interest in, and enthusiasm for, leveraging Big Data sources in the service of improving patient population health and the health of the general public. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) recently released a strategic plan for data science; there is no better time than now to create an initial bioethical framework to inform common data modeling decision points. The improvements in data quality that will derive from decision point mapping and bioethical review will enhance efforts to apply data models across a range of high-impact areas, from predictive analytics to support clinical decision-making to robust trending models in population health to better inform local, regional, and national health policies and resource allocation. To develop this initial bioethics framework, we will use well- established qualitative research methods (interviews, focus groups, and in-person deliberation) to map the decision points in biomedical data modeling research and document the rationales invoked to support those decisions (Aim 1 key informant interviews); assess those data science decision points and decision-making rationales for their bioethical ramifications (Aim 2 focus groups); and create an initial bioethics data modeling framework (Aim 3 deliberative meeting). This study would be the first to provide a bioethics framework to meet a critical gap in biomedical data modeling activities, where the downstream consequences of developing data models without careful and comprehensive review of ethical issues can be severe. This approach directly supports core scientific values of inclusivity, transparency, accountability, and reproducibility that, in turn, foster trust in biomedical data modeling output and potential applications, whether local, national, or global. Project Narrative This study would be the first to develop an initial bioethics framework to meet a critical gap in biomedical data modeling activities, where the downstream consequences of developing data models without careful and comprehensive review of ethical issues can be severe—not least because poorly developed data models have the potential to impact adversely the health of individuals, groups, and communities. Currently, there is limited conversation around potential bioethics issues in data modeling, and as yet no implementable guidance on how biomedical data science modeling research activities should occur. The initial ethics framework developed by this study would provide a roadmap to ensure that data modeling decision points are documented and their ethical ramifications considered at the outset of model creation, thus supporting core scientific values of inclusivity, accountability, reproducibility, and transparency that, in turn, foster trust in biomedical data modeling output and potential applications, whether local, national, or global.",Creating an initial ethics framework for biomedical data modeling by mapping and exploring key decision points,10039527,R21HG011277,"['Accountability', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Bioethical Issues', 'Bioethics', 'Bioethics Consultants', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethical Review', 'Ethics', 'Focus Groups', 'Fostering', 'General Population', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modeling', 'National Health Policy', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Process', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Allocation', 'Role', 'Services', 'Social Environment', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Walking', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'data modeling', 'data quality', 'data tools', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genomic data', 'high standard', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'informant', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'model development', 'patient population', 'population health', 'programs', 'public trust', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NHGRI,"HASTINGS CENTER, INC.",R21,2020,100000,0.006646812894528852
"Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, there are nearly 13,000 patients waitlisted for liver transplant, yet only two-thirds will receive a transplant, and in 2018 approximately 2,500 patients died or were removed from the waitlist due to medical deterioration. This shortage of donor livers available for transplant has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are higher risk than typical donor livers but may be safely transplantable in carefully selected recipients. These include older donors (>70 years), steatotic livers, and livers procured through donation after cardiac death. Due to their riskiness, these marginal livers are often declined, yet as many as 84% of patients who died on the transplant waitlist declined one or more marginal livers prior to death. In light of this, certain waitlisted candidates might have derived a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a marginal organ rather than remaining on the waitlist (i.e. they would have survived longer after a transplant with a marginal liver than they would have survived on the waitlist). Currently, decisions about whether a particular marginal liver is suitable for a particular candidate are based on clinical gestalt or simple subgroup analysis using traditional regression models, which likely do not fully approximate the complex interactions between donor, recipient, and transplant factors. To account for this, we will utilize machine learning (which can incorporate complex, higher-order interactions) to predict whether a specific candidate would derive a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a specific marginal liver, and interview transplant candidates and surgeons to understand how best to translate these predictions into an immediately clinically-useful decision aid. To accomplish this, we will leverage Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) national data (n=293,140) and use a machine technique (random forests) to address the following aims: (1) To predict waitlist survival for waitlisted liver transplant candidates; (2) To predict post-transplant survival for liver transplant recipients of a marginal liver; and (3) To create a decision aid that compares predicted waitlist survival and predicted post-transplant survival for a specific transplant candidates with marginal liver. These aims are highly feasible given our group’s expertise in liver transplantation, analysis of national registry data, and machine learning techniques. We hypothesize that utilizing SRTR and machine learning, we can accurately predict post-transplant survival for a particular candidate with a particular marginal liver, as well as waitlist survival for that same candidate without a liver. We also hypothesize that our decision aid could be utilized in real-time to inform clinical decision-making. If the proposed aims are achieved, our decision aid could be utilized to improve clinical practice by bringing high-quality risk prediction directly to patients and transplant professionals to directly inform the real-time clinical decision of whether a candidate should undergo transplant with a marginal liver. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are far fewer donor livers available for transplant than patients who need them, which has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are riskier than typical donor livers but yet might still provide a benefit to carefully selected patients. However, the decision to use a particular marginal liver for a particular patient is based largely on clinical gestalt or traditional clinical studies, which likely do not account for the complex relationships between donor, recipient, and transplant characteristics. To optimally inform the decision to undergo transplantation with a marginal liver or not, we propose to utilize machine learning to generate personalized risk predictions of post-transplant survival with that specific marginal liver and waitlist survival without that liver, and then develop a decision aid to be used by patients and surgeons to compare predicted survival between both options.",Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation,10068549,F32DK124962,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Computing', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Survey Methodology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplant Surgeon', 'Transplantation', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'liver transplantation', 'personalized decision', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'post-transplant', 'programs', 'public health research', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'transplant registry', 'web site']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2020,81310,0.03896239211329265

Specifically, this application addresses the urgent need for research on the coronavirus pandemic with a project focusing on informatics and data science to preemptively identify patients with the life- threatening complications of SARS-CoV-2, using CTSA-supported core resources. Characterized by severe hypoxemia, tachypnea, and decreased lung compliance, the diagnosis of acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a bad prognostic sign, and in a subset, leads to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The rates of Covid-19 infection and death in the Bronx have been higher than any other borough of NYC. As the major regional health system, our experience with Covid-19 provides guideposts that may prevent future victims of this pandemic. The bleak picture for ARDS in the 4,452 patients admitted showed that 78% of our intubated Covid-19 patients developed ARDS, with 42% mortality. The overall goal of this proposal is to leverage our novel informatics and analytics platforms enabled by the Einstein-Montefiore CTSA (NIH/NCATS 1ULTR002556), and extensive Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning resources to implement a novel, situational awareness and clinical decision support system for ARF and ARDS (SA-ARDS). We will re-train our existing deep learning models with data collected from Covid-19 patients and contextualize its implementation with data from the Covid-19 response during the pandemic in NYC. The SA-ARDS data platform will provide longitudinally integrated clinical data for research and multi-institutional and national collaborations, with the following specific aims: Aim 1: To integrate, re-train, and validate our novel, near real-time, Electronic Risk Assessment System (ERAS 1.0) optimized for early recognition of ARF, ARDS, and inpatient mortality; Aim 2: To develop an evidence based, real-time, and context appropriate Situational Awareness clinical decision support system targeting ARF and ARDS response (SA-ARDS); and Aim 3: Through our partner CTSA organizations, to standardize and disseminate ERAS 1.0 and the SA-ARDS to other health systems, including the NYC consortium of CTSA hubs and the PCORI INSIGHT network. We will use the clinical data underlying the SA-ARDS to support research in local, regional, and national collaborations. All the methods and tools developed will be shared with the CTSA community via NCATS' National Center for Data to Health (CD2H). PROJECT NARRATIVE The US is in the midst of a public health crisis of the Covid-19 pandemic. We will create an artificial intelligence system to provide an early warning system optimized for recognition of ARF, ARDS, and inpatient mortality, and provide a base for application of artificial intelligence to detection of other debilitating and potentially fatal outcomes of Covid-19.",CTSA Administrative Supplement for Informatics Core: A novel AI/ML system to predict respiratory failure and ARDS in Covid-19 patients,10158737,UL1TR002556,"['2019-nCoV', 'Acute', 'Acute respiratory failure', 'Address', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Expert Systems', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Injuries', 'Hospitals', 'Hypoxemia', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung Compliance', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'New York City', 'Organ', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Pneumonia', 'Population', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk Assessment', 'Seasons', 'Severities', 'Software Engineering', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Thromboembolism', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Upper Respiratory Infections', 'base', 'care delivery', 'care providers', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'complex data ', 'coronavirus disease', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'flu', 'health data', 'infection rate', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'preemptive intervention', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'response', 'software systems', 'tool']",NCATS,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,UL1,2020,1003424,0.015464611419888075
"Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope Abstract This SBIR Phase II project will develop a deep learning-based clinical decision support algorithm for detecting and diagnosing valvular heart disease based on heart sounds recorded using the Eko Core and Eko Duo Digital Stethoscopes. This screening tool will help to decrease the number of patients with valvular heart disease that remain undertreated simply because their condition is not diagnosed. Auscultation is commonly the method by which valvular heart disease is first detected, but cases often fail to be referred to echocardiography for diagnosis because clinicians fail to detect heart murmurs, particularly in noisy or rushed environments. To address this challenge, Eko had developed the Core, a digital stethoscope attachment that can be added in-line to a clinician’s existing stethoscope that amplifies heart sounds and Duo, a digital stethoscope in a handheld form factor with built-in single lead electrocardiogram. Both devices are designed to stream digitized phonocardiograms to a smartphone, tablet or personal computer. There, the signal can be analyzed with the decision support algorithm we will develop as part of this project. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to collect a database with condition- specific recording labels to enable deep learning for heart sounds though clinical data collection at six clinical sites, and (2) to develop and evaluate a collection of deep convolutional neural network-based algorithms trained on the database. These algorithms will (2a) distinguish between systolic, diastolic and continuous murmurs, (2b) classify aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and innocent murmurs (2c) assess the severity of AS, MR and TR. By integrating these deep learning algorithms into Eko's mobile and cloud software platform, currently used by clinicians at over 1000 institutions worldwide, we anticipate this algorithm will enable more accurate screening for valvular heart disease in adult patients, leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes. Public Health Relevance Valvular heart disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent manifestation of poor cardiovascular health in both the developed and developing world. A highly-accurate clinical decision support algorithm that is able to detect and classify valvular heart disease will impact public health by reducing unnecessary referrals for echocardiography and promoting early and accurate diagnosis in underserved areas with limited access to specialty care.",Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope,10079904,R44HL144297,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Area', 'Auscultation', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Eko', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart murmur', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm training', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cloud software', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sound']",NHLBI,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R44,2020,938347,0.024460109597313553
"Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs Project Abstract for HealthTech Solutions Kidney transplantation is a clinically effective and cost-effective treatment for patients suffering from end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and diabetes. Twenty-two patients die each day waiting for a transplant and 30% of all deaths in the US could be prevented by organ transplant. Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effective advantages of kidney transplantation, there has been a decades-long rise in the kidney discard rate from 5.1% in 1988 to 19.2% in 2015. During a successful Phase I grant and to address the need for a dedicated communications system to help improve transplant patient outcomes and achieve greater donated organ utilization, HealthTech Solutions (HTS), Inc. developed a proprietary mobile application for secure team communication tailored specifically for kidney transplant teams. To further improve communication efficiency and augment critical decision making in healthcare, specifically for surgeons, HTS will employ machine learning (ML) powered clinical decision support. Clinical decision support (CDS) may significantly increase access, increase quality, and reduce the cost of kidney transplantation. The proposed project is designed to further test and quantify the improvement of the donor management, coordination process, and kidney utilization outcomes using the company’s CDS and communication infrastructure for medical team communication. The aims are; 1) Develop CDS models specifically for transplant professionals aimed at improving decision times and decision confidence. Develop the CDS infrastructure capable of handling medical data and serving insights safely, securely, and rapidly; 2) Asses usability by working with a test group to exceed usability criteria and ensure that CDS meets clinician needs through user feedback iterations. Verification of utility from a diversified testing group (n=10) that represent every type of professional involved in transplant cases. 3) Measure the effects of TXP Chat enhanced with CDS after live clinical implementation in the kidney offer and procurement processes for more than 3,000 offers (1,500 with CDS and 1,500 control) over a period of 365 days with multiple partner institutions (n=3). TXP Chat and CDS will demonstrate to be reliable, secure, trustworthy and useful by the clinical/technical community, increase kidney acceptance practices resulting in an increase in kidney transplants, reduction in cold ischemic time, and reduction in time from offer to transplant. Ultimately, these metrics have been demonstrated in the literature to improve patient outcomes, reduce expensive chronic treatment costs (e.g. dialysis), reduce patient deaths from lack of kidney availability, and significantly improve human health and productivity. Study results will be disseminated via publication in a peer-reviewed journal. Aim 1 will lay the foundation for further development to enable wider CDS in the Phase IIB. Aim 2 will prove physician support and steady adoption trend as we roll into commercialization. Aim 3 will provide multi-center pilot study data used to prove increased efficiency of the process in terms of time, money, and total number of kidneys transplanted. Project Narrative Despite the obvious clinical and cost-effectiveness advantages of kidney transplantation for many patients, nearly 1 in 5 kidneys authorized for donation are discarded. This project addresses the need for an efficient communications software technology enhanced with clinical decision support tailored for organ procurement organizations and transplant centers. Combined with enhanced communication efficiency, clinical decision support powered by machine learning may significantly improve donated kidney utilization and increase the number of viable, but currently unused organs that could otherwise be successfully transplanted, reducing waste and saving lives.","Artificial intelligence-enabled, real-time communication software for optimizing clinical decision making during the allocation, procurement, and transplantation of donated organs",10017295,R44LM012575,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asses', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Direct Costs', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Journals', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Multiple Partners', 'Organ', 'Organ Procurements', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Renal Glycosuria', 'Reporting', 'Savings', 'Secure', 'Surgeon', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Transplantation', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Treatment Cost', 'Waiting Lists', 'Work', 'burnout', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical implementation', 'cohesion', 'commercial application', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'improved', 'insight', 'mobile application', 'operation', 'prevent', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'transmission process', 'transplant centers', 'trend', 'usability', 'wasting']",NLM,ORGANIZER,R44,2020,975104,0.05759214115690196
"Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care Summary: Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care  A future vision of clinical decision support must transcend constraints in scalability, maintainability, and adaptability. The shortage of 100,000 physicians by 2030 reflects unmet (and unlimited) demand for the scarcest healthcare resource, clinical expertise. Over 25 million in the US alone have deficient access to medical specialty care, with delays contributing to 20% higher mortality. There is no quality without access.  Our goal is to develop a radically different paradigm for outpatient specialty consultations by inductively learning clinical workups embedded in clinical data. We focus on predicting the concrete clinical orders for medications and diagnostic tests that result from specialty consultations. This can power a tier of fully automated guides that will enable clinicians to initiate care that would otherwise await in-person specialty visits, opening access for more patients.  The major scientific barriers are advances in data science and decision support methods for collating clinical knowledge, with continuous improvement through clinical experience, crowdsourcing, and machine learning. Our innovative approach is inspired by collaborative filtering algorithms that power “Customers like you also bought this...” recommender systems with the scalability to answer unlimited queries, maintainability through statistical learning, and adaptability to respond to evolving clinical practices.  Our team uniquely combines expertise in clinical medicine, electronic medical records, clinical decision support, statistics and machine learning to enhance medical specialty consultations through aims that seek to: (1) Develop methods to generate clinical decision support by predicting the clinical orders that will result from Endocrinology and Hematology specialty consultations; (2) Evaluate and iteratively design clinical collaborative filtering prototypes based on clinical user input on usability and acceptability; and (3) Determine which consult clinical order patterns are associated with better results through reinforcement learning and causal inference frameworks. Completion of these aims will yield a sustained, powerful impact on clinical information retrieval and knowledge discovery for synthesizing clinical practices from real-world data. By addressing grand challenges in clinical decision support, adoption of these methods will fulfill a vision that empowers clinicians to practice to the top of their license, making healthcare more scalable in reach, responsiveness, and reproducibility Project Narrative There can be no quality without access, and over 25 million in the US alone have deficient access to the scarcest healthcare resource: Human medical expertise. Building on methods analogous to commercial product recommender systems, the proposed research will automatically learn practice patterns from electronic medical records. Distributing predictable practices of medical specialty consultations can then enable healthcare systems to achieve broader patient access to timely and consistent care.",Machine Learning Clinical Order Recommendations for Specialty Consultation Care,10265158,R56LM013365,"['Active Learning', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consult', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Electronic Mail', 'Endocrinology', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hematology', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Hyperthyroidism', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Retrieval', 'Inpatients', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modern Medicine', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Primary Health Care', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Specialist', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'convolutional neural network', 'crowdsourcing', 'data streams', 'design', 'experience', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'iterative design', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized decision', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'tool', 'usability']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2020,394250,0.05667443087056622
"Data-driven shared decision-making to reduce symptom burden in atrial fibrillation PROJECT SUMMARY Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia with symptoms that directly impair health-related quality of life (HRQoL). While catheter ablation is routinely performed to reduce AF symptoms and improve HRQoL, we lack evidence about which symptoms are likely to improve and for which patients. Ablations themselves may cause complications that lead to lower HRQoL. Shared decision-making (SDM) is a widely encouraged practice to navigate such complex choices by aligning treatment benefits and risks with the patient's stated values. However, no SDM interventions have focused explicitly on AF symptoms due to a lack of rigorous evidence about post-ablation symptom patterns and the decision aids necessary to communicate those findings. In this K99/R00 application, we propose to use data from electronic health records (EHRs) to characterize post-ablation symptom patterns, and display them in decision-aid visualizations to support personalized SDM about the best treatment modalities for an individual's patient's AF symptoms. In the K99 phase, we will use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to extract and analyze symptom data from narrative notes in EHRs. We will also employ a rigorous, user-centered design protocol created during my postdoctoral work to develop decision-aid visualizations. In the R00 phase, we will conduct a feasibility study in which the interactive decision-aid visualizations are introduced during consultations about ablation in clinical electrophysiology practices. Our specific aims are: (1) identify common symptom patterns in patients with paroxysmal AF post-catheter ablation (n>32,014); (2) develop and evaluate decision-aid visualizations of common AF symptom patterns (n=50); and (3) evaluate the feasibility of implementing the decision-aid visualizations in clinical practice (n=75). The training objectives of this project include mastering competencies in NLP, ML, human-computer interaction, symptom science, and implementation science. The long-term training goal is to assist Dr. Reading Turchioe to become a faculty member with an independent program of research. She seeks to lead an interdisciplinary team of scientists and clinicians committed to improving symptom management and HRQoL for individuals living with AF and other chronic cardiovascular conditions, with an eye towards health equity. To ensure success for the planned research and training activities, a multidisciplinary team of mentors with complementary expertise, established, well-funded programs of research, and a record of mentoring high-quality trainees will advise her. Moreover, this research will be conducted in a world-class academic medical center with exceptional resources for building and implementing technology and data science methods using EHR data. The proposed research is both significant and innovative: NLP and ML methods to extract EHR data for decision-aid visualizations are a novel approach to SDM in the understudied area of AF symptoms. Together, these techniques promise to enhance HRQoL for other AF treatment modalities (e.g. medications, lifestyle changes) and other chronic cardiovascular conditions. ! ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Our research has public health significance because atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and expected to double in prevalence in the next decade as the population ages. “Real-world evidence” from electronic health record data displayed in personalized decision-aid visualizations can enable patients and providers to choose together the optimal treatments for symptom reduction. Our proposal addresses NINR's key areas of “Symptom Science: Promoting Personalized Health Strategies” and “Promoting Innovation: Technology to Improve Health” by leveraging innovative technologies to deliver personalized interventions that reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life for individuals with chronic conditions. !",Data-driven shared decision-making to reduce symptom burden in atrial fibrillation,9953270,K99NR019124,"['Ablation', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Cardiac ablation', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Display', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Decision Aid', 'Devices', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enabling Factors', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fatigue', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Impaired health', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mobile Health Application', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nursing Informatics', 'Outcome', 'Palpitations', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reading', 'Reinforcing Factor', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'associated symptom', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'common symptom', 'comorbidity', 'computer human interaction', 'data visualization', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health equity', 'health related quality of life', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'insight', 'instrument', 'mHealth', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'minimally invasive', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel strategies', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized decision', 'personalized intervention', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'reduce symptoms', 'shared decision making', 'statistics', 'success', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'treatment risk', 'user centered design']",NINR,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K99,2020,87632,0.019118270433644582
"Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics The complex environment of modern radiation therapy (RT) comprises data from a rich combination of patient- specific information including: demographics, physical characteristics of high-energy dose, features subsequent to repeated application of image-guidance (radiomics), and biological markers (genomics, proteomics, etc.), generated before and/or over a treatment period that can span few days to several weeks. Rapid growth of these available and untapped “pan-Omics” data, invites ample opportunities for Big data analytics to deliver on the promise of personalized medicine in RT. This particularly true in promising but high-risk RT procedures such as stereotactic body RT (SBRT), which have witnessed tremendous expansion due to clinical successes in early disease stages and socio-economic benefits of shortened high dose treatments. This has led to the desire to exploit these treatments into more advanced stages of cancer, however, the unknown risks associated with increased toxicities hamper its potential. Therefore, robust clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) capable of exploring the complex pan-Omics interaction landscape with the goal of exploiting known principles of treatment response before and during the course of fractionated RT are urgently needed. The long-term goal of this project is to overcome barriers related to prediction uncertainties and human-computer interactions, which are currently limiting the ability to make personalized clinical decisions for real-time response-based adaptation in radiotherapy from available data. To meet this need and overcome current challenges, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team including: clinicians, medical physicists, data scientists, and human factor experts. Specifically, we will develop and quantitively evaluate: (1) graph-based supervised machine learning algorithms for robust prediction outcomes before and during RT; (2) deep reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize treatment adaptation; and (3) a user-centered software prototype for RT decision support, with the broader goal of building a comprehensive real-time framework for outcome modeling and response-based adaption in RT. We hypothesize that the use of advanced machine learning techniques and user-centered tools will unlock the potentials to move from current population-based approaches limited by subjective experiences and heuristic rules into robust, patient-specific, user-friendly CDSSs. This approach and its corresponding software tool will be tested within two clinical RT sites of lung and liver cancers, to demonstrate its versatility and highlight pertinent human-computer factors and cancer specific issues. Impact statement: Patient-specific big data are now available before and/or during RT courses, offering new and untapped opportunities for personalized treatment. This study will overcome current shortcomings of population-based approaches and data underuse in current RT practice by investigating and developing an intelligent, computer-aided, user-centered, personalized CDSS and test its performance in rewarding but high- risk RT scenarios. The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment. Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,9947903,R01CA233487,"['Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Network', 'Bedside Testings', 'Benchmarking', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hostage', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Regimen', 'Regrets', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computer human interaction', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'experience', 'fractionated radiation', 'heuristics', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'irradiation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'radiation risk', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,112864,0.04698197308089971

The approach is also applicable to other modern cancer regimens. With the wide variety of treatment prescription options in radiation therapy, physicians and patients need to weigh the benefits and risks of each treatment; these treatments are delivered over multiple treatment sessions where additional patient-specific data become available. Clinical decision support can play a pivotal role in deliberations related to response-based adaptation of treatment. Therefore, we are exploring and benchmarking large-scale adaptive machine learning methods for building a robust decision support system tool in terms of efficacy, human-computer factors, and the ability to handle large data uncertainties for clinical practice in the complex but promising environment of high dose radiation treatment of lung and liver cancers as case studies.",Optimal Decision Making in Radiotherapy Using Panomics Analytics,10250778,R01CA233487,"['Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Network', 'Bedside Testings', 'Benchmarking', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Case Study', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Dose Fractionation', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hostage', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Liver', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of liver', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Nature', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reaction Time', 'Regimen', 'Regrets', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical center', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computer human interaction', 'deep learning', 'deep reinforcement learning', 'demographics', 'experience', 'fractionated radiation', 'heuristics', 'high reward', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'irradiation', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized decision', 'personalized medicine', 'population based', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'prototype', 'radiation risk', 'radiomics', 'rapid growth', 'response', 'side effect', 'socioeconomics', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment duration', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NCI,H.

"Intention-aware Recommender System for Improving Trauma Resuscitation Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY Critically injured patients have a four-fold higher risk of death from medical errors than other hospitalized patients, with nearly half of preventable deaths related to errors during the initial resuscitation phase. Although protocols, simulation, and leadership training improve team performance in this setting, as many as 12 protocol deviations per resuscitation have been observed, even with experienced teams. Given adverse outcomes that can result from performance gaps, there is a critical need to establish novel approaches for applying real-time decision support in critical-care settings. The long-term goal is to implement decision support for trauma resuscitation and other fast-paced, high-risk critical care settings that improves performance, reduces errors, and prevents adverse outcomes. The overall objective for this renewal is to vertically advance what was achieved during the first funding period by designing, implementing and testing an intention-aware recommender system that (1) recognizes and tracks current goals using sensor data, the output from patient monitors, and data captured from digital devices, (2) derives recommendations that support adherence to goal- based protocols, and (3) displays these recommendations in real time on wall displays. The central hypothesis is that decision support aligning with intentions (“intended” or “current” goals) will enhance protocol compliance, leading to improved outcomes related to trauma resuscitation. The rationale for this renewal is that recommendations supporting protocol compliance that are aligned with team intentions are more likely to be adopted by being less distracting and associated with lower cognitive load. Guided by preliminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) design and implement an automated real- time approach for predicting and monitoring the assessment and treatment goals of trauma resuscitation; and 2) generate and display a recommended plan of activities that supports current goal pursuit during trauma resuscitation. For the first Aim, machine learning approaches will be applied for recognizing goals using data obtained from sensors and other digital data sources. Under the second Aim, a machine learning strategy will be implemented and tested that generates recommendations responsive to team intentions. The proposed research is innovative because it focuses on development of real-time methods that integrate goals as an input for making recommendations that meet the most current and relevant information needs. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to improve the care of severely injured and other critically ill patients by promoting timely and appropriate achievement of critical assessment and treatment goals in settings that remain at high-risk for medical errors. The results of this research continuum are expected to have an important positive impact on the outcome by addressing the mismatch between complex decision-making and human vulnerability to error that remain in critical care settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project is relevant to public health because it focuses on the design and implementation of a novel real-time decision support system that will reduce errors associated with adverse patient outcomes by providing recommendations that support the current information needs of multidisciplinary trauma teams.

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: expanding dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches for pandemic scenarios PROJECT SUMMARY The emergence and global expansion of SARS-CoV-2 as a human pathogen over the last four months represents a nearly unprecedented challenge for the infectious disease modelling community. This pandemic has benefitted from huge volumes of data being generated, but the rate of dissemination of these data has often outpaced existing data pipelines. While the last decade has seen significant advances in real-time infectious disease forecasting — spurred by rapid growth in data and computational methods — these methods have primarily focused on seasonal endemic diseases based, are based on historical data, and so do not apply easily to this novel pathogen, or to pandemic scenarios. New methods are needed to leverage the wealth of surveillance data at fine spatial granularity, together with associated information about policy interventions and environmental conditions over space and time, to reason directly about the mechanisms to forecast and understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. These methods must use sound statistical and epidemiological principles and be flexible and computationally efficient to provide real- time forecasts to guide public health decision-making and respond to changing aspects of this global crisis. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop scalable, computationally efficient Bayesian hierarchical compartmental models to flexibly respond to state-level public health forecasting needs, and (2) to design models and conduct analyses to draw robust inference about the effectiveness of interventions in impacting the reproductive rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections within the US to build an evidence-base for continued responses to COVID-19 and future pandemics. PUBLIC HEALTH NARRATIVE The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is an emerging public health crisis. A fundamental challenge is how to turn data into evidence that can inform decision-making about managing resources, improving health outcomes, and controlling further spread of SARS-CoV-2. Real-time forecasting and flexible mechanistic models to understand the disease dynamics can provide policy-makers tools to manage public response. The goal of the proposed research is to adapt existing statistical modeling frameworks and develop new ones for making forecasts of COVID-19 in real-time and integrating these forecasts into public health decision making.",Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: expanding dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches for pandemic scenarios,10150377,R35GM119582,"['2019-nCoV', 'Award', 'Budgets', 'COVID-19', 'Calibration', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Dengue', 'Dengue Fever', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Endemic Diseases', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation Methodology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Infection', 'Influenza', 'Influenza prevention', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Policies', 'Policy Maker', 'Programmed Learning', 'Public Health', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Resources', 'Series', 'Social Distance', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thailand', 'Time', 'Work', 'base', 'data dissemination', 'data pipeline', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'infectious disease model', 'influenza epidemic', 'machine learning method', 'model design', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'pathogen', 'predictive modeling', 'rapid growth', 'real world application', 'reproductive', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'sound', 'statistical and machine learning', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST,R35,2020,78507,0.03502459062076684
"Transforming Kidney Care in the Emergency Department using Artificial Intelligence Driven Clinical Decision Support PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The objective of this proposal is to determine best-practice methods for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI)- derived insights into emergency care. This investigation will use the iterative development and evaluation of an AI-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system to prevent or mitigate acute kidney injury (AKI) as a reference use-case. We are responding to the AHRQ Special Emphasis Notice: Health Services Research Priorities for Achieving a High Value Healthcare System (NOT-HS-18-015), calling for research on prevention of disease through incorporation of AI into healthcare and on interventions to prevent kidney disease progression. Emergency departments (EDs) deliver high-volume patient care in hazardous decision-making environments fraught with excessive cognitive loading and time-pressure. AI has potential to support ED clinician decisions by exploiting large-scale electronic health record (EHR) data to aid prognosis, extract signal from noise, and reduce untoward variability in practice. Despite AI’s fervent promotion, translation to practice is rare and means to incorporate AI that is trustworthy, transparent, and explainable in the ED are unknown. AKI is an important target for AI-driven predictive modeling. It is prevalent and strongly associated with adverse outcomes including dialysis and death, yet is under-recognized and therefore under-treated. In addition, many ED treatments inadvertently promote the progression of AKI and kidney disease. AKI prevention is achievable with evidence-based CDS at the point of care. We will use our AI-driven model, with proven capacity for early and reliable AKI risk estimation, to achieve the following Specific Aims: Aim 1: Develop an AI-driven algorithm for promotion of AKI-focused clinical decision-making in the ED. We will leverage previously developed AKI surveillance and prediction tools to generate a unified EHR-based algorithm that empowers ED clinician prevention of kidney disease progression. Aim 2: Translate the AI algorithm to an AKI-CDS system to enable in-depth study of Clinician-AI interactions in the ED. We will establish end-user requirements while creating data collection instruments to examine AI in the ED. Both efforts will support the development of the AKI-CDS system to pilot and investigate ED clinician perceptions of AI trustworthiness and explainability in preparation for multi-site implementation. Aim 3: Perform a multi-site effectiveness-implementation evaluation of the AKI-CDS system in the ED. We will implement the AI-driven CDS system across three ED study sites using a pragmatic investigational framework to perform effectiveness and implementation evaluations in parallel. The research proposed will generate new knowledge and tools to advance the study of AI in the ED, and will result in a scalable CDS product with the capacity to improve the quality of kidney care delivered to more than 1 million patients affected by AKI in the US each year.

"Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration Project Summary Diagnostic imaging costs $100 billion annually. These healthcare costs are expected to increase in the coming decade as the national population ages and the pool of insured patients increases. The size and growth of these costs concern policy makers, payers, and society alike. The use of advanced imaging for PE has increased 27 fold in recent years, and this sharp escalation has the potential to expose patients to unnecessary procedures, tests, and risks due to incidental findings. Although radiologists do not order most radiology exams, these physicians are the target of criticism about the rising costs and possible overuse of radiology services. The healthcare industry has called upon radiologists to manage the potential overuse of advanced imaging and to take the lead on investigating best practices for the optimal use of advanced imaging. The ideal sources of information for imaging utilization guidelines are randomized, controlled imaging clinical trials. However, these trials are cost and time intensive, exceedingly difficult to conduct, and typically use narrow patient-inclusion criteria, making it challenging to generalize the results to broader clinical situations. Alternative sources of reliable evidence, such as observational or retrospective studies, have been lacking. The widespread adoption of electronic medical records (EMRs) and the increasing availability of computational methods to process vast amounts of unstructured information now make it possible to learn directly from practice-based evidence. We propose that “big data” clinical repositories, including radiology reports, can lend themselves to a treasure trove of point-of-care, relevant, actionable data that can be used in an innovative and cost-sensitive approach to evaluate the appropriate use of medical imaging. We aim to create a predictive model that leverages real-time EMR clinical data from top national medical centers to arrive at a patient-specific imaging outcome prediction. We recognize that clinicians have to make on-the-spot medical imaging-ordering decisions and they generally do not comply with existing clinical decision support rules. Our study aims to provide clinicians with a tool that can leverage aggregate patient data for medical imaging decision making at the point of care. The overarching approach of this study is to utilize scalable methodology that can be widely applied to leverage EMR data to predict the outcome of a several other high-cost, low-yield imaging tests. This proposal has the potential to better inform advanced imaging in the learning healthcare system of the future and reduce unnecessary imaging examinations and healthcare costs. Project Narrative Imaging costs make up a significant proportion of health care expenditures and cause concern among policy makers, insurers, and patients alike; the inappropriate use of imaging technology is in part a result of imperfect risk models for imaging clinical decision support tools. Current risk models are often irrelevant to patients and as such, clinicians do not always heed to these recommendations, which in turn leads to unnecessary treatments and increased costs. We propose to create a precision health predictive model that leverages real-time electronic medical record data to arrive at a patient-specific imaging prediction in order to enhance imaging decision making at the point of care and optimize advanced image utilization.",Deep Learning for Pulmonary Embolism Imaging Decision Support: A Multi-institutional Collaboration,9926311,R01LM012966,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Support Model', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exposure to', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare Industry', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Incidental Findings', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Precision Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Services', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Spottings', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Unnecessary Procedures', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'aged', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnosis standard', 'flexibility', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'informatics tool', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'lung imaging', 'model building', 'mortality', 'new technology', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'payment', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'radiologist', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,348620,0.03412528619414915

"Statistical methods for real-time forecasts of infectious disease: dynamic time-series and machine learning approaches PROJECT SUMMARY The past decade of biomedical research has borne witness to rapid growth in data and computational methods. A fundamental challenge for the scientific community in the 21st century is learning how to turn this deluge of data into evidence that can inform decision-making about improving health and preventing illness at the individual and population levels. The emerging field of real-time infectious disease forecasting is a prime example of a research area with great potential for leveraging modern analytical methods to maximize the impact on public health. Infectious diseases exact an enormous toll on global health each year. Improved real- time forecasts of infectious disease outbreaks can inform targeted intervention and prevention strategies, such as increased healthcare staffing or vector control measures. However we currently have a limited understanding of the best ways to integrate these types of forecasts into real-time public health decision- making. The central research activities of this project are (1) to develop and validate a suite of robust, real-time statistical prediction models for infectious diseases, (2) we will develop and evaluate an ensemble time-series prediction methodology for integrating multiple prediction models into a single forecast, and (3) to develop a collaborative platform for dissemination and evaluation of predictions by different research teams. Additionally, we will develop a suite of open-source educational modules to train researchers and public health officials in developing, validating, and implementing time-series forecasting, with a focus on real-time infectious disease applications.

"TREAT ECARDS: Translating Evidence into Action: Electronic Clinical Decision Support in ARDS PROJECT SUMMARY With an associated mortality of 35%, Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) contributes to the morbidity and mortality seen in many acute conditions such as pneumonia, influenza, sepsis, trauma and aspiration. Yet studies consistently show that ARDS is under-recognized in up to 40% of patients with generally low and variable adoption of practices shown to improve mortality in ARDS. The overall goal of this proposed project is to improve care delivered to ARDS patients by promoting accurate identification of patients with ARDS and increasing adoption of evidence-based interventions shown to improve outcomes in ARDS. With the recent publication of a multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS, this proposal specifically aims: 1) To increase identification of ARDS patients with an automated electronic tool (ARDS Sniffer 2.0) powered by the predictive analytics of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing. 2) To translate the recently published multi-professional Clinical Practice Guideline (CPG) on mechanical ventilation in ARDS into an evidence-based, context-appropriate, Electronic Clinical decision support system in ARDS (ECARDS) for the management of ARDS. This process will be informed by an expert panel from the CPG committee as well as a semi-qualitative analysis of the cognitive decision making process, data needs and workflow of users in a series of Think-Aloud studies and focus group interviews. ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ECARDS and an ARDS Dashboard to show near real-time data on the incidence of ARDS and rate of utilization of best care will then be incorporated within the hospital EMR for useability testing with another series of Think-Aloud and semi-qualitative studies. 3) To evaluate the effectiveness of ARDS Sniffer 2.0, ARDS Dashboard, and ECARDS in a stepped-wedge, cluster randomized control trial of 3 hospitals within the Montefiore Healthcare System to increase utilization of recommended interventions in ARDS and improve outcomes. 4) To promote the dissemination of the clinical decision support system through our partner professional organizations of American Thoracic Society, Society of Critical Care Medicine, and American Association of Respiratory Care and Program for Emergency Preparedness. Because of the high pressure, high acuity, and rapidly changing status of the acutely ill ARDS patient, clinical decision making often defaults to the automated, pattern-driven cognitive processes which are particularly prone to unconscious biases and errors and cognitive overload from large volumes of shifting data. As such, this proposal is the ideal research demonstration project to develop a new clinical decision support tool that will harness the power of big data and predictive analytics to identify ARDS in the hospital and deliver an evidenced-based, expert and user informed clinical decision support tool to clinicians at the right point during their clinical interaction and workflow with these patients in order to promote the right interventions to the right patients at the right time. PROJECT NARRATIVE Even as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome constitutes the most severe form of respiratory failure in the hospital with an associated mortality of 35%, it is consistently under-recognized and proven treatments are underutilized. This proposal aims to harness the power of big data in the hospital information system to identify patients with ARDS and prompt clinicians with the evidence-based best management of this condition.

"PHORA: A Clinical Decision Support Tool for Patients with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ABSTRACT This application seeks to develop a multi-platform clinical decision support system (CDSS) in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) for physicians, PHORA (Pulmonary Hypertension Outcomes Risk Assessment), which can be used to: (a) guide therapeutic decisions and (b) optimize clinical trial design. We will achieve this goal by utilizing clinical trial data from several large databases of completed trials in PAH, an ongoing PAH registry (REVEAL), as well as observational sessions with physicians. The proposed aims co- create the CDSS with a multi-disciplinary group of specialties including: biomedical engineering, advanced PAH physicians, computer science (machine learning/data mining), human computer interaction, and allied health care experts. Our intention is to engage all stakeholders to achieve consensus and thereby assure the acceptance of PHORA into practice. Successful completion of this project will lay the foundation for a prospective, multi-center trial in which PHORA will be evaluated with respect to long-term patient outcomes. The ultimate aim is to disseminate this resource so as to improve the efficiency, efficacy, and cost- effectiveness of this treatment for PAH. PROJECT NARRATIVE Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rapidly progressive fatal disease for which there are few therapeutic options. Understanding how to predict clinical responses to available therapeutics would be a significant clinical advance in treating this disease by permitting tailored, targeted and effective first line therapies.

"Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Bladder cancer is a common type of cancer that can cause substantial morbidity and mortality among both men and women. Bladder cancer causes over 16,870 deaths per year in the United States with 79,030 new bladder cancer cases diagnosed in 2017. A reliable assessment of the response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying tumors that do not respond and allowing the patient a chance of alternative treatment. We have successfully developed a computer decision support system (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. A quantitative image analysis tool for bladder cancer (QIBC) that quantifies the bladder gross tumor volume (GTV) and image characteristics is an important component of CDSS-T. Advanced machine learning techniques are used to merge the GTV and radiomic biomarkers into an effective predictive model. The goal of this project is to validate the effectiveness of CDSS-T as an aid to the radiologists and the oncologists in assessment of bladder cancer change as a result of treatment through pilot clinical trials. We will (1) perform a preparatory clinical trial with the clinicians at UM, which will simulate the real prospective clinical trial with high quality retrospective data, (2) deploy the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the three collaborating clinical sites, (3) use the QIBC and CDSS-T tools at the different clinical sites in the prospective pilot clinical trial (standard clinical workflow) utilizing the decision support in parallel to the standard clinical patient care, and (4) analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the clinicians' performance in the pilot clinical trial and assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. We hypothesize that this innovative approach can improve clinicians' accuracy, consistency and efficiency in bladder GTV estimation and assessment of treatment response. To test these hypotheses, we will perform the following specific tasks: (1) to evaluate the performance of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on cases not previously used, new to the system, for both the prediction accuracy and the automatic standalone functionality, refine and optimize the design of the user interface based on clinicians' feedback after their hands-on experience with the system to ensure its practicality and robustness, familiarize clinicians with the performance of the CDSS-T tools and the interpretation of the CDSS-T outputs as a part of user training for the prospective pilot clinical trial, (2) to optimize the QIBC and CDSS-T tools for the clinical workflow at the different clinical sites based on the site clinicians' feedback in order to operate efficiently and in a standalone mode by clinicians, (3) to record the clinicians' predicted outcomes without and with the use of the tools during the pilot clinical trials, estimate the accuracy of assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the current clinical treatment paradigm by comparing the estimated response to the histopathologically determined response after radical cystectomy, and (4) to statistically analyze the impact of the QIBC and CDSS-T tools on the performance of the clinicians in the pilot clinical trial and statistically assess the potential impact on clinical outcome. PROJECT NARRATIVE We have previously developed a computer decision support system for (CDSS-T) for monitoring of bladder cancer treatment response. If successfully deployed and utilized, CDSS-T will be a useful tool to aid clinicians in improving the accuracy and reproducibility of tumor treatment response assessment. Improving the reliability in assessment of treatment response to neoadjuvant therapy at an early stage is vital for identifying patients who do not respond to preserve their physical condition, thus allowing them to seek alternative treatment, which may reduce morbidity and improve the quality of life of patients suffering from bladder cancer. In addition, the multi-site pilot clinical trial will provide an excellent opportunity to experience the process of bringing laboratory research from bench to bedside, which will serve as a valuable guide for future development of clinically practical tools for various diseases.",Biomarker-Based Tools for Treatment Response Decision Support of Bladder Cancer,9926229,U01CA232931,"['Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Neoplasm', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratory Research', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of urinary bladder', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Oncologist', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Cystectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tumor Volume', 'United States', 'Woman', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'design', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,U01,2020,625336,0.0021392208494799853
"Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. Health disparities exist in cancer screening and mortality. Although cancer mortality rates have decreased steadily over the past 25 years, the racial gap persists, and socioeconomic disparities are widening. Improved early detection and treatment can decrease cancer mortality, but many barriers exist to screening uptake. Cancer screening is often a trade-off for both patients and clinicians among different cancer screenings and other preventive opportunities, each of which have their own barriers to completion. This study seeks to improve quality of care and reduce health disparities in cancer mortality by using informatics to better tailor clinical discussions in order to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and help overcome barriers to screening. The study has the following aims: 1) to develop a predictive model that identifies patients > 50 years old eligible for lung, breast and colorectal cancer screening who are at high-risk for missing these screenings; 2) to develop and pilot test a prototype shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians that will increase screening uptake; 3) to perform a pragmatic trial of the refined multilevel intervention that utilizes a shared decision-making support tool for patients and clinicians.  During the planning phase, data from the electronic health record (EHR) will be combined with supplementary data sources (e.g. Area Health Resource File, LexisNexis) to identify patients at risk of not completing recommended screening for these cancers. Hold-out cross-validation will be used to estimate model accuracy. Machine learning model building following feature selection will utilize logistic regression and decision trees to ensure the models are easily transferable to other healthcare settings and interpretable. This predictive model will be used to develop and pilot test an application that will (A) utilize predictive modeling to identify eligible patients likely to miss screening; (B) determine, after providing patient education, patient preferences and concerns regarding screening through self-report augmented by predictive modelling; (C) identify available community resources to facilitate screening; (D) provide this information to patients and to clinicians in the EHR prior to clinical visits to assist shared decision-making conversations and support active problem solving of identified barriers. This multilevel intervention will be pilot-tested and refined within 4 academic primary care practices over 6 months (N=24 clinicians; 8181 potential screenings yearly). A pragmatic trial will be conducted during the R33 phase using a stepped wedge cluster randomized design (N=45 clinicians; 11,239 potential screenings yearly). Completed cancer screening will be the primary outcome. Patient experience, clinician satisfaction and utilization will also be assessed. If successful, this approach will lead to an intervention tailored to the patient and their community that leverages information technology in a scalable way that is transferrable to other clinical settings and types of preventive services. PROJECT NARRATIVE Significant disparities exist in breast, colorectal and lung cancer, the leading causes of cancer mortality, requiring the development of new interventions that increase screening uptake in diverse populations. We propose an intervention that employs a multilevel approach that leverages the Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supplementary data sources to develop a predictive model to identify eligible patients at high-risk of not obtaining screening and to facilitate improved shared decision-making conversations using an EHR based decision-making support tool that interacts with patients and clinicians. By personalizing the approach to screening and improving the quality of patient-clinician interactions, we hope to enhance patient motivation to receive screening services and reduce health disparities.",Improving Cancer Screening Through A Tailored Technology-Based Intervention,10051055,R61AG068951,"['Advisory Committees', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Hispanics', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Intervention', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Patient Education', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Preventive', 'Preventive screening', 'Preventive service', 'Primary Health Care', 'Problem Solving', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rural Community', 'Screening for cancer', 'Services', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'base', 'cancer health disparity', 'cancer type', 'colorectal cancer screening', 'design', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'health care settings', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'low socioeconomic status', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model building', 'mortality', 'personalized approach', 'pragmatic trial', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'primary outcome', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'regression trees', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'sex', 'shared decision making', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'uptake']",NIA,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R61,2020,279223,-0.015900341228029295
"Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes Summary The objective of this proposal is to optimize the design and evaluate a robust artificial pancreas (R-AP) system for use in patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (T1D) with HbA1C greater than 8% and compare HbA1C outcomes in these patients relative to a decision support system that utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Although high risk patients have possibly the most to gain from usage of AP technology, they are oftentimes under-represented or excluded from clinical trials. This has been because of the increased risk of failure of these AP systems that were not designed to handle inconsistent reporting of meals, variable activity level, and infusion set failures. An AP system for high risk patients needs to be designed to achieve maximal benefit, including reducing the risk of acute and chronic complications. A major obstacle for enabling the AP for usage by high-risk patients is that these patients may be less compliant with use guidelines for the system including missed meal announcements, infrequent sensor calibrations, and prolonged infusion set wear leading to infusion set failures. In this grant, we will integrate new risk-mitigation features into the OHSU single-hormone AP to enable usage by high-risk patients that fall into the categories described above. We present new algorithms for automating the detection of missed meal announcements, missed calibrations, and robust handling of hybrid usage mode. While AP systems may be an optimal choice for improving glycemic control, many people with T1D prefer MDI therapy. Decision support systems such as the DailyDose decision support system developed at OHSU can be used to improve glycemic control for patients who prefer MDI therapy. The DailyDose decision support system is designed for CGM augmented MDI therapy. It enables on-demand calculation of insulin doses, automates insulin dose adjustments based on pattern recognition, and uses machine learning approaches to alert the patients to events such as predicted hypoglycemia and missed meal doses.The benefit of the DailyDose system is that it is a simple system and does not require use of an insulin pump, which may be a challenge for some patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes as pump therapy is more intensive and requires infusion set changes. It is unknown in this high risk group of people whether patient needs, quality of life, and glycemic control are best addressed with an AP system or decision support tool or if both treatments are appropriate. We have designed a 3-month clinical study to compare glycemic outcomes during AP vs. decision support interventions in a high- risk T1D cohort (HbA1C 8-10.5%), with the aim of demonstrating a significant clinically relevant reduction in HbA1C. Our hypothesis is that both AP and decision support therapies will decrease HbA1C relative to baseline but that the AP will provide further benefit over DailyDose. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. We propose to integrate features into the OHSU artificial pancreas to optimize it for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c>8-10.5%) and compare it to DailyDose, a decision support system that uses multiple daily injections.",Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes,9969424,R01DK120367,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Carbohydrates', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modification', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'arm', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes distress', 'engineering design', 'expectation', 'falls', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'in silico', 'patient population', 'primary outcome', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'risk mitigation', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'support tools']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,599203,0.04521719025692357
"Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a disease characterized by pancreatic beta destruction with subsequent insulin depletion. The alterations in glucose dynamics are incredibly difficult to manage and are confounded by meals, exercise, menstruation, and stress. Although automated insulin delivery systems are becoming commercially available, the large majority of people with T1D are treated with multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI). Dangerous complications of hypoglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis can occur from failure to dose insulin correctly, however vigilant adherence to tedious insulin dosing strategies are difficult for MDI users maintain. This difficulty is magnified during exercise, which is critical to ameliorating long-term complications of diabetes; even when guidelines for insulin dosage adjustments are followed, acute hypoglycemia during exercise and night-time hypoglycemia can occur. In our recent survey of 1400 subjects living with T1D, the majority of subjects on MDI therapy were not confident in managing their glucose during exercise and felt they lacked tools to do so. In aggregate, difficult treatment schedules and bolus calculations, associated acute complications from daily activities, and the emotional and psychological toll of this chronic disease can result in treatment non-adherence and poor glycemic outcomes. Therefore, there is a critical need for decision support tools designed for MDI users to improve glycemic control surrounding meals, daily activities and exercise. The goal of this proposal to develop a decision support tool for patients with type 1 diabetes who utilize continuous glucose monitoring systems and multiple daily injection therapy. This tool will be called miTREAT, the multiple injection treatment recommender system for exercise-aware therapies. We hypothesize that use of a novel decision support tool equipped with content-based collaborative filtering methods and dynamic exercise hypoglycemia prediction algorithms will improve overall euglycemia and reduce time spent in hypoglycemia for patients on MDI therapy. In our first aim, we will leverage decades of research in computer science recommender systems and machine learning optimization strategies to develop a novel decision support system that identifies issues in glycemic control and recommends appropriate insulin dose and behavioral modifications. In our second aim, we will develop a new exercise model that reflects both the dynamics of rapid-uptake of glucose through GLUT-4 channels and the longitudinal biphasic insulin sensitivity profile. This new model structure will be used to predict hypoglycemia during and after the exercise period. In our third aim, we will explore the performance of our decision support engine in an in-vivo clinical trial. This clinical trial will assess the usability of a new smart-phone app designed to assist MDI users that we have developed at OHSU. In achieving these goals, we will develop the first decision support system that provides treatment and behavioral recommendations to patients on CGM-augmented MDI therapy. This system will improve overall time in euglycemia, and reduce the occurrence of acute complications surrounding exercise. Project Narrative Type 1 Diabetes is difficult to manage through multiple daily injections, and there is a paucity of tools available to assist patients with treatment decisions. In this proposal, the fields of computer science, machine learning, constrained optimization and clinical science are united to develop a novel decision support tool for multiple daily injection users. This is accomplished in three parts: 1) we will tune a decision support system to correctly identify issues in patient glycemic control and recommend appropriate treatment modifications; 2) we will develop a new hypoglycemia prediction tool that reflects the longitudinal dynamics of glucose uptake during and after exercise; and 3) we will explore the performance of this decision support system and hypoglycemia prediction tool in a clinical trial.",Design and Evaluation of a Decision Support Engine for Advanced Treatment of Type 1 Diabetes,9898150,F31DK121436,"['Acute', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Assimilations', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical Trials', 'Closure by clamp', 'Complications of Diabetes Mellitus', 'Cross-Over Trials', 'Cutaneous', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Physiology', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Insulin', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical Technology', 'Menstruation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Output', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plant Roots', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Running', 'SLC2A1 gene', 'Site', 'Stress', 'Structural Models', 'Study Subject', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Trust', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'computer science', 'design', 'diabetes management', 'dosage', 'e-commerce', 'euglycemia', 'exercise intensity', 'glucose disposal', 'glucose monitor', 'glucose uptake', 'glycemic control', 'heuristics', 'human subject', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insulin sensitivity', 'mathematical model', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'psychologic', 'resistance exercise', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'smartphone Application', 'standard of care', 'support tools', 'tool', 'usability']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,50520,0.08847160531902842
"Improving Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Gram-Negative Infections through a Personalized Smart Antibiogram Project Summary/Abstract Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most urgent public health threats. In 2019, the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that infections with AMR affect at least 2.8 million people and are associated with at least 35,900 excessive deaths annually in the US. This threat is particularly problematic among Gram-negative rod (GNR) pathogens in which high-rates of resistance to last-line antimicrobials have emerged globally, while our efforts to develop new antimicrobials have stumbled. To decelerate the emergence of AMR among GNR pathogens, it is essential to guide clinicians away from choosing unnecessarily broad-spectrum antimicrobials. An antibiogram, a facility-level summary of antimicrobial susceptibility data, is a common local reference tool which clinicians use when choosing empiric therapy. However, antibiograms have major limitations. First, little is known about how clinicians are currently using them when making empiric therapy decision. Second, antibiogram data is aggregated at the facility-level, and data may be skewed based on the type of practice or geographic area. Lastly, but most importantly, an antibiogram does not consider any patient-level factors. Therefore, there are strong, and pressing needs to understand 1) how an antibiogram is used by the clinician, 2) how much an antibiogram reflects the risk of AMR for individual patients and 3) how we can overcome limitations of antibiogram to optimize empiric therapy and reduce AMR. The overall goal is to create a novel, real-time personalized antibiogram (“Smart Antibiogram”) to overcome current limitations of antibiogram and to optimize clinician choice of empiric therapy for GNRs by providing a “predicted risk of AMR” based on a machine learning model incorporating patient- and facility-level data. This goal will be accomplished through (a) Master of Science in Health Informatics coursework, (b) a Mentorship Advisory Committee, (c) carefully selected conferences and workshops, and (d) a mentored research study. Our specific aims are to (1) Characterize the current use of antibiograms in clinical practice and measure the acceptable risk of resistance when clinicians make empiric therapy decisions for Gram-negative bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections within diverse clinical settings; (2) Assess the accuracy of currently-used antibiograms to predict the risk of resistance for individual patients in a large retrospective microbiology cohort for GNR infections; (3) Develop a machine learning model to predict the individualized risk of AMR for patients infected with GNR pathogens and validate prospectively and externally. This will lead to the future development of a personalized decision support tool (“Smart Antibiogram”). The expected outcomes of this AHRQ K08 Award will be the comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness and limitations of antibiogram, and the informatics toolkits to develop Smart Antibiogram. At the end of this K08 Award, the candidate will be well-prepared to become an independent investigator with expertise in AMR and health informatics, with specific strength in AMR prediction model decision-support system. Project Narrative Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among Gram-negative rod organisms is one of the most urgent public health threats in the United States and globally. By using series of survey of clinicians, retrospective cohort analyses, and machine learning prediction analytics, this study elucidates the current perceptions for AMR among providers and creates a machine learning model to accurately predict AMR risk at patient-level. The findings from this study will help create a decision-support system to guide clinicians for appropriate empiric therapy to treat infections due to Gram-negative rod organisms and prepare the applicant for a career as an independent infectious diseases health service investigator.",Improving Empiric Antimicrobial Therapy for Gram-Negative Infections through a Personalized Smart Antibiogram,10124644,K08HS027472,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,K08,2020,144640,0.023364557858289454
"Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization Project Summary: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization A recent White House initiative titled Advancing American Kidney Health outlines the current administration's plans to increase the supply of kidneys in the US, along with other measures that attempt to correct the imbalance between supply and demand for kidneys. In alignment with this White House initiative, the principal investigator (PI) of this project will develop algorithms to assist Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs) make donor disposition decisions with the goal of increasing the supply of transplantable organs. The PI will harness the vast amount of data collected by OPOs, and customize as well as develop new Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to identify good donors. These algorithms will reduce case coordinators workload and improve the accuracy of their decisions. The PI's objective is to quantity the impact of AI-assisted decision-making on increasing the supply of kidneys by ﬁnding missed opportunities on account of the current manual processes. Even a few more potential donors per OPO will help reduce the organ shortage problem when scaled to all 58 OPOs across the country.  This project will leverage unique data sets to generate and test hypotheses concerning which fac- tors aﬀect donor disposition decisions, and which information processing protocols produce greater referral-to-donor conversion rate. It will also customize classiﬁcation algorithms to assist case co- ordinators make donor disposition decisions. The focus will be on improving both the accuracy and speed of such decisions. As a follow up of this project, the PI will conduct a broader study involving at least ﬁve additional OPOs. The ﬁve OPOs will be selected to represent the diversity in size, population, and geography among the 58 OPOs across the country. Results of this and the follow-up study will be shared freely with all OPOs. The proposed research has the potential to increase the number of donors, free up staﬀ time, and lower OPO labor costs.  The potential impact of this project lies in the formulation and testing of hypotheses that can beneﬁt OPO decision-making and people on transplant wait list, customization of existing machine learning algorithms and computational techniques for sequential decision-making in a novel setting, and laying the groundwork for the development of new methods in the future.  The PI has the necessary disciplinary expertise, and management and leadership experience to succeed in the proposed eﬀorts. He has access to advanced computing resources and administrative help from the University of Texas. Finally, he has obtained the necessary IRB approval to proceed with this project. 1 Project Narrative: Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization The widespread use of electronic medical record systems by hospitals, and electronic capture of referrals data by the organ procurement organizations (OPOs) makes it possible to harness large amounts of data to augment human decision-making and ask whether this can increase the supply of organs, speciﬁcally kidneys. The PI in this project will focus on improving the speed and accuracy of case coordinators' donor-disposition decisions by developing and testing customized machine learning and sequential decision-making algorithms using data from two OPOs. These eﬀorts will help quantify the potential beneﬁt of leveraging OPO data to increase kidney supply and pave the way for a larger study focusing on multiple OPOs.",Organ Procurement and Information Process Optimization,10042096,R03HS027671,[' '],AHRQ,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2020,41981,0.060529438501235044
"Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations TOWARD A HIGH DIMENSIONAL COMPUTATIONAL DESCRIPTION OF VARIATION IN HUMAN DECISION-MAKING ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC AND NON-PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS PI: Dr. John P. O'Doherty Institution: California Institute of Technology PROJECT SUMMARY  Computational psychiatry (CP) promises to gain deeper explanatory insight into psychiatric disorders through the application of formal computational models to task-related behavioral data and brain measures. However, research in CP to date has mostly involved a narrow unidimensional focus, utilizing either a relatively limited set of computational constructs such as simple model-free (MF) reinforcement learning (RL), and/or restricted to studying a specific task, a specific disease, or even a particular model parameter. For CP to reach its potential, we need to broaden the field's scope. To achieve this, it is necessary to develop an integrated theory and formal framework supported by a task battery that will enable the quantification of individual differences across a range of computational mechanisms pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of clinical disorders. The objective of the current proposal is to implement the initial groundwork needed to build and test a computational framework and task battery that can facilitate a multi-dimensional computational description of individual variability in parameters relevant for characterizing psychiatric dysfunction.  We have constructed a computational assessment battery (CAB) consisting of four distinct yet inter- related tasks that move beyond simple RL to probe various aspects of learning, cognition, and decision-making. First, we assess learning about losses as well as rewards. Secondly, we measure model-based (MB) alongside simple MF learning and decision making, and the arbitration allocating control to either strategy. Thirdly, we examine strategies for solving the exploration/exploitation dilemma, in which individuals have to decide whether to exploit an option known to yield reward or explore an option whose outcomes are unknown. Finally, we assess social-learning, in which an individual can either infer the goals of another individual or simply imitate that agent's behavior.  We propose to build an integrated computational model that can capture relevant computations being implemented in each of the tasks in our battery, alongside a hierarchical model-fitting and parameter estimation framework to enable us to retrieve reliable parameter estimates for each computational variable of interest. We will leverage common computational mechanisms engaged across our task battery to improve estimability and generalizability. We will then acquire behavioral data in a large on-line (n=1000), and modest (n=100) in-lab sample on the CAB to establish the internal validity and test/re-test reliability of our computational model and parameter estimates. Finally, we will explore the relationship between model-estimated parameter estimates from behavior on our task battery and variability in self-reported traits and states relevant for psychiatric disease in our healthy samples, as well as in a pilot sample (n=60) of patients recruited from the UCLA psychiatry outpatient clinics. These efforts will form the basis of a Computational Psychiatry Toolbox for behavioral testing, model-fitting and parameter estimation that will eventually be released as a resource to the research community. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop a comprehensive approach to characterize an individual's ability to think, learn and make decisions in terms of a series of specific brain processes or `computations'. We then aim to determine whether variation in these computations can in turn be related to a variety of symptoms that can occur in psychiatric disorders. To achieve this, we will develop new mathematical and experimental tools to assess variation in behavior across individuals, and refine, test and validate these tools in a preliminary sample of healthy participants and psychiatric patients.",Toward a High Dimensional Computational Description of Variation in Human Decision-Making Across Psychiatric and Non-Psychiatric Populations,9989897,R21MH120805,"['Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'Anxiety', 'Arbitration', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'California', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Functional disorder', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Undifferentiated', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavior test', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale simulation', 'recruit', 'social learning', 'targeted treatment', 'theories', 'tool', 'trait', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R21,2020,204080,0.019934000857589843
"Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery Project Summary     Coronary bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves the lives of patients with coronary disease (CAD) as a group,  but 20% of patients remain symptomatic one year after surgery. In clinical practice CABG decisions are largely  driven by stenosis severity determined from invasive angiography despite the known relevance of functional  CAD  parameters.  This  practical  impasse  will  continue  to  exist  without  clinically  available,  high-­resolution,  quantitative functional imaging, and a better understanding of the clinical outcomes in relation to anatomical  (angiography)  and  functional  (ischemia,  scar  tissue)  factors.  The  long-­term  goal  is  to  improve  outcome  of  CABG  through  personalized  imaging-­guided  care.  The  overall  objective  of  this  proposal  is  to  identify  determinants  of  myocardial  flow  restoration  (ischemia  reduction),  and  develop  integrated  imaging  tools  for  individualized,  lesion-­specific  CABG  decision-­making,  and  computational  flow  simulations  based  on  the  patient’s  anatomy  and  function  to  predict  the  hemodynamic  outcome.  Supported  by  studies  using  invasive  FFR-­guided  CABG,  the  rationale  for  the  proposed  research  is  that  integration  of  anatomical  (angiography)  and functional information (ischemia, scar tissue) will identify individual coronary vessels that will benefit from  revascularization, and individual optimization of surgical procedures by flow simulations will maximize clinical  benefit  of  CABG  for  patients  with  CAD.  Supported  by  promising  preliminary  data,  three  specific  aims  are  proposed:  1)  Prospectively  identify  angiographic,  functional  and  clinical  baseline  determinants  of  outcome  after CABG, defined as improvement of myocardial perfusion (ischemia reduction) and angina symptoms;; 2)  Develop  and  validate  a  comprehensive  imaging  strategy  and  clinically  applicable  tool  that  integrate  high-­ resolution  angiographic  and  quantitative  functional  information  (ischemia,  viability)  for  per-­vessel/lesion  revascularization  decisions;;  3)  Develop  and  validate  new  multi-­parametric  computational  flow  simulations,  with incorporation of functional imaging data, which allows for prediction of individual hemodynamic outcome  and  ultimately  surgical  optimization  based  on  virtual  hemodynamic  results.  This  approach  is  innovative  because  new  imaging  techniques  will  advance  the  field’s  understanding  of  CABG  physiology,  and  new  clinically applicable tools will be developed for comprehensive clinical decision-­making and optimized surgical  planning. The acquired knowledge and developed tools are applicable to other vascular contexts, and may  also  be  instrumental  for  new  therapeutic  innovations.  The  proposed  research  is  significant  because  identification  of  CABG  outcome  determinants,  and  new  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance,  have  the  potential  to  improve  the  effectiveness  (by  complete  functional  revascularization)  and  efficiency  of  CABG  (by  avoiding  futile  grafts).  For  a  large  group  of  patients,  these  innovations  will improve  the patient-­valued  benefit  of  CABG (complications, symptoms),  and also decrease  cost by improved efficiency of care.     Project Narrative    The proposed research is relevant to the public health because identification of CABG outcome determinants,  and  development  of  diagnostic  solutions  for  comprehensive  decision-­making  and  procedural  guidance  of  CABG  surgery,  can  help  achieve  complete  functional  revascularization  and  restoration  of  myocardial  blood  flow  in  more  patients.  Thus,  the  proposed  research  is  relevant  to  the  NIH’s  mission  that  pertains  to  the  discovery of fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of  that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. ",Comprehensive CT Guided Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery,9869041,R01HL141712,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Behavior', 'Blinded', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Catheterization', 'Characteristics', 'Chest Pain', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Coronary Occlusions', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Infarction', 'Intuition', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity -
