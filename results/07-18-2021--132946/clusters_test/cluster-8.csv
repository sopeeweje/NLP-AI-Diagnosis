"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10204729,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data repository', 'experience', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,639861
"Rapid Evaluation of Neuronal Activity in the Intact Whole Brain at Single Cell Resolution Project Summary  Here we seek to develop a “Neuronal Activity Quantitative Diagnostic” platform and reagent kits to disseminate accessible products for measuring recent neural activity across the entire mouse brain to the neuroscience community. Previously we have shown that the activity-dependent immediate-early gene protein products Npas4 and cFos can be clearly detected, imaged, and quantified using developmental versions of our platform tools. Immediate early genes are genes that are activated transiently and rapidly in response to a wide variety of cellular stimuli. The three overlapping aims to be investigated in this Phase II project are:  1) Demonstration of the fidelity of our assay for our customers. To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our neuronal activity assay with another well-known assay for activity, we will perform two photon calcium fluorescence imaging in the primary visual cortex of mice presented with repeated visual stimuli. We will clear and stain the brains for cFos and Npas4 and demonstrate the fidelity of these markers for detecting recently active neurons.  2) Develop and beta test robust versions of our software tools useable by researchers with no specialized coding or statistics knowledge. We will develop Stitchy and BrainSnap into robust, user-friendly software products that remove the current analysis bottleneck for neuroscientists interested in whole-brain imaging. Stitchy will be an improved browser-based version of our internal software that simplifies and speeds the process of stitching together light sheet microscope images. BrainSnap software will integrate our high-performance 3TK- Quant framework for machine learning-enabled quantification and our statistical framework for whole-brain anatomics, 3TK-Stats, in a browser-based interface. We have recruited end users who will test this software in a head-to-head comparison with our in-house testing.  3) Develop and test a brain clearing and staining kit for neuronal activity. To help researchers produce high quality cleared brains stained with neuronal activity markers, we will generate Neuronal Activity clearing and staining reagents kits for cFos and Npas4. These will be tested by collaborators in head-to-head comparisons with our in-house procedures on brains prepared in parallel.  At the end of Phase II, Translucence will have a market-ready Neuronal Activity Quantitative Diagnostic platform including reagent kits, user-friendly software, and service options. Project Narrative Translucence uses cutting-edge technology to make brains optically clear coupled with computational tools to map and quantify neuronal activity at single-cell resolution across the entire mouse brain. Our project seeks to develop Neuronal Activity Quantitative Diagnostics kits, services, and software for basic scientists and drug development companies to use in their experimental paradigms.",Rapid Evaluation of Neuronal Activity in the Intact Whole Brain at Single Cell Resolution,10255188,R44MH119989,"['Anatomy', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Clinical Services', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Reagent Kits', 'Evaluation', 'FOS gene', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mus', 'NPAS4 gene', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Reagent', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Tools', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Stimulus', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Work', 'activity marker', 'area striata', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'diagnostic platform', 'drug development', 'fluorescence imaging', 'head-to-head comparison', 'improved', 'interest', 'microscopic imaging', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'user friendly software', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,"TRANSLUCENCE BIOSYSTEMS, INC.",R44,2021,1373193
"Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and contributes to other cognitive tasks through its efferent projections. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of an autism mouse model propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors.  One of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), is a deficit in social interaction. In mice, similar social behavior impairments can be modeled by altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For RTT, knocking out the gene that is mutated in humans, Mecp2, causes hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, resulting in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize how the vHIP influences mPFC activity through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection. Importantly, we will test whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and deficits in social interaction. We hypothesize that atypically strong vHIP afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance and synaptic plasticity, which in turn contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and unbiased machine-learning behavioral assessments.  We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) identify and characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; 2) characterize long-term synaptic plasticity of the vHIP-mPFC projection in Mecp2 KO mice; and 3) determine if chemogenetic modulation of the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons alters mPFC function and social behaviors.  These studies will provide fundamental information on the functional and structural properties of the long- range connection between the vHIP and mPFC in the developing brain. The impact of this work extends beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism,10087555,R01MH118563,"['Affect', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Contralateral', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Label', 'Link', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Membrane', 'Memory impairment', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'cellular targeting', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive task', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'experimental study', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'postnatal development', 'response', 'social', 'social deficits', 'spatial memory', 'voltage sensitive dye']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,393603
"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",10134450,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'confocal imaging', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'detection method', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2021,527956
"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,10132411,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'rabies viral tracing', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,403711
"Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT How the brain generates the correct number of neurons and how these neurons determine the size of their arbors to innervate the receptor field is a critical question in neurobiology. The Drosophila visual system is hard wired and iteratively organized into columns, providing an excellent model to answer these questions. Drosophila medulla multicolumnar neurons exhibit 5 to 750 neurons per cell type; each neuron class possesses a distinct morphology and projects its arbors across multiple columns in the optic lobe. The host lab has obtained single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data that determined the transcriptome of almost all optic lobe neuron cell types throughout development. The first aim of this project is to understand the molecular and cell biological mechanisms that dictate neuron number. Under the mentorship of Claude Desplan at New York University (K99 phase), I will perform genetics experiments that decisively address the role of programmed cell death, neural stem cell division number, and neuroepithelial size of origin in regulating the number of multicolumnar neurons produced. I will also perform lineage tracing experiments to determine whether molecularly similar cell types are generated at the same time. With Holger Knaut at NYU Medical Center, I will learn quantitative live imaging techniques to distinguish whether neural stem cells divide a limited number of times to generate low-abundance neural classes, or whether cell fusion of immature progenitors drives cell number. The second aim of this project is to determine the morphological and genetic processes that dictate the size and orientation of the arbors of multicolumnar to allow them to cover distinct receptor fields. With the bioinformatics expertise of Itai Yanai at NYU Medical Center, I will perform RNAseq on adult neurons that are not numerous enough to be identified in our existing scRNAseq data sets. I will then use machine learning algorithms to identify these neurons during development in our existing scRNAseq libraries and thus identify candidate genes required for the regulation of neuron number and arbor size (R00 phase). I will combine these molecular experiments with live imaging to quantitatively characterize how multicolumnar neurons determine the orientation and size of their arbors. Preliminary data indicates that cell death and the size of neuroepithelial region of origin in part dictate multicolumnar neuron number; I have also identified a neuropeptide whose function is essential for the regulation of neuron arbor size. My work will clarify the molecular basis of neuron abundance and determine how neurons present in small numbers regulate their arbor size to ensure that their environment is uniformly sampled, a problem common to many brain regions in most species. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding how neurons are generated in the correct numbers and how they appropriately space their arbors is of relevance to the fields of developmental neurobiology, neurology and regenerative medicine. Failure to properly specify or target neurons may cause congenital neurological diseases, and our work may identify molecular targets used for treatment. Comprehension of how neurons are made and how they target is also of relevance to regenerative medicine, as stem cell therapies will soon be able to generate diverse neural types which may be transplanted to treat blindness, brain injury and neurodegeneration.",Understanding the regulation of neuron cell number and arbor size,10104237,K99EY032269,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Blindness', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Death Inhibition', 'Cell fusion', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Comprehension', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Failure', 'Ganglia', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Processes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inhibition of Apoptosis', 'Kinetics', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Logic', 'Maps', 'Medical center', 'Memory', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Mutate', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuroepithelial', 'Neurology', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neuropil', 'New York', 'Optic Lobe', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Photoreceptors', 'Population', 'Regenerative Medicine', 'Regulation', 'Retina', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Transcript', 'Transplantation', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'cell type', 'developmental neurobiology', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroblast', 'neuroepithelium', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'retinotopic', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'somatosensory', 'stem cell division', 'stem cell therapy', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'two-photon']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,140333
"Actin-mediated regulation of organelle dynamics in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease Project Summary  Organelle dynamics profoundly affect the physiology of the cell and are regulated by interactions with the cytoskeleton. Alterations in organelle dynamics (i.e., inter-organelle and cytoskeletal contacts, fission, and mobility) are associated with a variety of human diseases, particularly neuropathies. Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is the most commonly inherited neuropathy and is caused by mutations in at least eighty different genes. Although the mutations that cause CMT are often in genes linked to altered organelle dynamics, questions remain regarding the pathogenic mechanism. Mitochondrial fission is mediated by the polymerization of actin at ER-mitochondria contact sites via the ER-anchored, actin polymerizing protein INF2. Dominant activating mutations in INF2 cause increased mitochondrial fission and excessive actin accumulation on mitochondria, which reduces mitochondrial mobility. Similar mutations in INF2 also cause CMT. Preliminary data show that 1) actin accumulates at fission sites of other organelles including endosomes, lysosomes, peroxisomes, and the Golgi, and 2) that CMT mutations in INF2 cause a reduction in endosome and lysosome mobility. This leads to the central hypothesis of this proposal: there is a conserved molecular mechanism regulating organelle fission and mobility mediated by actin cytoskeletal proteins at ER-organelle contact sites. Furthermore, it is proposed that reduction in organelle mobility specifically affects peripheral neurons due to the extreme length of these cells and hence may be a general pathogenic feature of CMT. The Specific Aims of this project are as follows: Aim 1 focuses on the role of INF2 in mitochondrial, endosomal, and lysosomal fission and how these processes are altered by mutations in INF2 that cause CMT. These studies will be carried out in primary human fibroblasts via live-cell imaging, including the use of a novel, innovative probe that specifically labels ER-associated actin. Experiments to assess organelle functions and to directly implicate actin polymerization in the phenotypes observed will also be performed. Aim 2 will be carried out in cultured primary mouse neurons in order to properly assess how alterations in organelle dynamics and mobility affect neuronal health. Deep learning-based image restoration will be used to achieve high spatiotemporal resolution imaging of organelle mobility. Aim 3 will include organelle and neuronal health assays in the context of disease-relevant models of CMT. Specifically, neurons derived from CMT patient fibroblasts and neurons from mice injected with AAVs directing expression of CMT- mutant INF2, MFN2, or RAB7A will be analyzed. Completion of these aims will provide mechanistic insight into the role of actin in organelle fission and mobility, how these processes are coupled, and test the novel hypothesis that CMT involves global disruption of mobility of multiple organelles. This will further our understanding of the pathogenic mechanism of CMT and perhaps other neurodegenerative disorders. The project will also enhance my scientific training by providing me with invaluable training in neurobiology and neurodegeneration, designing novel imaging probes, advanced imaging techniques, stem-cell based reprogramming, and mouse models. Project Narrative Alterations in organelles (e.g. mitochondria) are linked to various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Charcot- Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease; however, our understanding of how organelle dynamics are regulated is still not complete. While actin has a known role in ER-mediated mitochondrial fission through the activities of the actin- regulatory protein INF2, our preliminary results suggest a common mechanism at play in other organelles. This proposal focuses on ER- and actin-mediated organelle fission, how this process impacts organelle motility, and the consequences of CMT mutations that disrupt these processes in nerve cells in culture and in mice.",Actin-mediated regulation of organelle dynamics in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,10142253,F32GM137580,"['Actins', 'Affect', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Dependovirus', 'Disease', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum', 'Endosomes', 'Environment', 'Fibroblasts', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Label', 'Length', 'Link', 'Lysosomes', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neuropathy', 'Organelles', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Polymers', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Site', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Testing', 'Training', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'depolymerization', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'genetic regulatory protein', 'hereditary neuropathy', 'human disease', 'imaging approach', 'imaging probe', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'live cell imaging', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'nanobodies', 'nerve stem cell', 'novel', 'peroxisome', 'polymerization', 'programs', 'restoration', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell technology', 'stem cells']",NIGMS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,F32,2021,66390
"Water and chloride movement in neurons during seizure activity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are no pharmacological treatments for cytotoxic edema, which is a common consequence of multiple brain insults, including hypoxic-ischemic and traumatic brain injury, stroke, metabolic derangements, and seizures. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), with an incidence of 1.5 of every 1,000 live births, is a type of brain damage in newborns caused by oxygen deprivation and limited blood flow. HIE is associated with seizures, and both correlate with long-term morbidity, including cerebral palsy, cognitive delay, epilepsy, vision loss, and deafness. HIE and neonatal seizures result in cytotoxic edema, which is characterized by the accumulation of water, chloride (Cl-), and other ions. The mechanisms of water movement that make neurons swell during the neonatal period are unknown. There is a critical need to determine how water moves into neurons that result and perpetuate neuronal swelling during the neonatal period, as there are no direct treatments for cytotoxic edema at this age. Knowing the pathways of water movement in neurons is the first step to develop innovative ways to treat cytotoxic edema, which will prevent neuronal cell death and improve the treatment of neonatal seizures. Neurons do not have water channels to allow the movement of water. Multiple pathways have been described in different cell types, but it is unknown which ones participate during the neonatal period. Our long- term goal is to identify the mechanisms of neuronal swelling in the developing brain and how this swelling results in neuronal death. Our central hypothesis for this proposal is that specific cation-chloride cotransporters (CCCs) move water, along with Cl-, in and out of neurons during cytotoxic edema in the neonatal period. This hypothesis is based on our data demonstrating the linked movement of water and Cl- in neurons during cytotoxic edema. We will test our hypothesis through two specific aims. Aim 1 will determine the pathway of water movement into neurons during swelling in the neonatal period. Aim 2 will determine the paths of water movement out of cortical neurons that prevent progressive swelling during the neonatal period. We will use multiphoton imaging techniques to measure changes in neuronal size and their Cl- concentration during swelling in different transgenic mouse lines expressing both Cl- sensitive and insensitive fluorophores, in vitro, and in vivo, while altering the CCC function either pharmacologically or through genetic manipulation. Also, we will use a novel deep learning algorithm to analyze the changes in neuronal size during swelling. Our studies will uncover fundamental mechanisms on how neurons swell and what mechanisms prevent progressive swelling during early brain development. Our results will have a broad impact as they will open new research avenues on neuronal volume regulation in the newborn and will guide the development of drugs targeting cytotoxic edema, which are currently lacking. Moreover, our results will apply to other severe brain injuries in children that are associated with cytotoxic edema and elevated neuronal Cl- concentration, including trauma, and stroke. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on determining the pathways that lead to water accumulation during cytotoxic edema, a pathological state observed in multiple neurological injuries of the newborn, resulting in cell death and difficult to treat seizures. Once the pathways are identified, there is the potential for significant advancement in the treatment of neuronal swelling, which is currently lacking.

"Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology approach. Project Summary Males and females elicit aggressive behavior for resources and survival. Male aggression has been well studied in many species. However, not much is known about female aggression. Recently, my work identified a small female- specific subgroup of cells in the pC1 brain region (pC1α neurons), that triggered females to fight at extremely high intensity levels when activated. For the K99 phase, I will build on my previous work and elaborate on the pC1α neurons circuitry under the mentorship of Dr. E. Kravitz, a well-renowned expert in aggression and Drosophila genetics. Aim 1 is concerned with determining the pre- and post-synaptic partners of the pC1α neurons. For this aim, I will work with my co-mentor, Dr. R. Wilson, to determine pre- and post- synaptic partners and design transgenic fly lines to target these areas. Based on my preliminary data of electron microscopy tracings, I hypothesize that, a)SAG neurons provide inputs to pC1α neurons; and b) pC1α neurons project dendritic outputs to PVL04om_pct neurons in areas previously identified in aggression such as Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum. I anticipate that both up- and down-stream pC1α neurons partners will induce high intensity female aggression. Aim 2 will investigate the role of candidate aggression-associated genes in pC1α neurons. I will train in single-cell profiling methods (used by the Kravitz lab) and address the hypothesis that genes overexpressed in male aggression mediating neurons also play key role in pC1α neuron function. In collaboration with co-mentor Dr. B de Bivort, I will also use neural network-based body part tracking software to train a classifier to automatically label aggressive behaviors. This will allow me to use machine-learning algorithms to capture multi-dimensional representations of the phenotypic differences among fly lines with mutations and transgenic effectors that target aggression circuits (e.g, activating and inhibiting a neuron or overexpressing aggregating proteins). The trainings acquired in my mentored K99 phase will facilitate my transition to independent research studying age-related diseases and behavior. Severe behavioral disturbances of aggression and agitation have been reported to be increasingly common during the progression of Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias.The reasons for this are completely unknown. Moreover, there is a dearth of understanding of how changes in neurons, during neurodegeneration, lead to specific behavioral defects. For the R00 phase, I will shift my focus to looking at aggression in neurodegenerative disease models and begin my efforts by elucidating the contribution of neuronal protein aggregates of Aβ-42 to aggression. My preliminary data indicates that overexpression of human Aβ-42 in using a (pan-neuronal driver) in males and (cholinergic driver) in females induces heightend levels of aggression. Based on these findings, I hypothesize Aβ-42 overexpression induced aggression is due to altered excitability of key aggression promoting neurons. I plan to use diverse and integrative systems approaches (learned from my mentored phase). I will lead a multi-pronged research effort to understand the mechanisms by which neurons regulate their normal function in the presence of an aging and or neurodegenerative disease state and how these changes affect circuit pathways and ultimately aggression. Project Narrative Aggression accompanies a number of common human neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's and other related dementias), with little understanding of how cognitive and aggression symptoms may be linked at the neuronal level. Aggression has been extensively studied in males of many species, but neglected in females (likewise, the interaction of sex and age is neglected). The objective of this research program is to identify the neural circuitry that governs female aggression (K99- mentored phase) and later transition (R00- independent phase) into discovering mechanisms of dementia-related pathology and how these changes affect aggression.",Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology approach.,10192224,K99GM141449,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Female', 'Ganglia', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Instinct', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'PC3 cell line', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical aggression', 'Play', 'Population', 'RNA Interference', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Senile Plaques', 'Social Behavior', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'bullying', 'cholinergic', 'cholinergic neuron', 'common symptom', 'connectome', 'design', 'extracellular', 'fighting', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal excitability', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein aggregation', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sex', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,100000
"Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking Project Summary Walking is an essential and conserved behavior across the animal kingdom. The ability to move in a coordinated, robust yet flexible manner is a crucial for an animal’s survival in the ever changing environment. Motor behaviors are controlled by sensory neuropils in the brain which talk to motor centers such as the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the thorax to execute precise motor outputs. Descending neurons are the primary conduits of information that accomplish this connection between the brain and the VNC. However the downstream target neurons and complex circuits that precisely govern the execution of a specific kind of limbed motor output such as running, turning, slowing down, switching gait, climbing, stepping etc remain individually undefined. This project aims to map these individual circuits that control different walking kinematics. In aim 1, we will map the post-synaptic targets of descending neurons using a translabeling technique called Trans Tango. We already know from previous studies that have characterized the morphology of all the descending neurons in Drosophila, which DNs target the leg neuropils in the ventral nerve chord. These descending neurons are very likely to be directly implicated in controlling walking behavior. Additionally, we also have broad behavioral information for a subset of the DNs. Using this existing morphological and behavioral data, we can start to map out the motor and premotor circuits that are downstream of these DNs and reveal the distinct circuit components that control specific walking kinematics. Some of the DNs we plan to screen, affect similar behaviors hence it will be interesting to reveal whether they converge onto similar or different targets. In the second aim, we aim to use a computational approach search for generation Gal4 lines whose neuronal expression patterns match the downstream target neurons we want to study. Existing split Gal4 lines will be identified or new ones will be generated in order to gain genetic access to the downstream circuit neurons of interest. In the third aim, we will use three behavior setups: Flywalker, the Arena and the fly-on-ball setup to study a range of walking parameters in high resolution using optogenetics intersectional strategies. We will use optogenetic activation, silencing and also epistasis experiments to map out which components of the circuit are sufficient or necessary for a particular walking kinematic. Project Narrative An animal’s ability to walk in a regulated manner is controlled by the brain through coordinated neural circuitry. Descending neurons are the bridges connecting the brain to the motor centers in thorax that then controls limbed coordination and movement but the exact circuitry downstream of descending neurons responsible for walking remain undefined.

"Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution Project Summary The dynamic adaptability of the mammalian brain to environmental changes is remarkable, as it is the complexity of the networks of neurons underlying the operations that allow for such adaptations. Although we have some understanding of the anatomical and functional basis of this, we are still lacking a detailed picture of how the modulation of neuronal activity works. What is the timing and locations of these neuromodulator release and relationship with excitatory/inhibitory circuits? How does the neuromodulators circuitry accomplish the regulation of firing and synaptic properties of targeted neurons? Filling these gaps in knowledge would advance our understanding of all aspects of neuromodulator biology and allow discovery of new therapeutic strategies. To help close this gap, we have used creative approaches to the development of genetically encoded to directly report behaviorally triggered and modulated neuromodulator release including serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). We have disseminated these indicators to the neuroscience community and spurred major discoveries of novel mechanisms regulating neuromodulator release underlying motivation and addiction. Build on this initial success, we propose to further expand the effectiveness of this toolbox of NM sensors to enable imaging sparse release at depth and subcellular resolution. Our specific goals are to (1) improve the sensitivity of our current sensors to enable robust imaging of sparse neuromodulator release, push their spatial resolution to the subcellular level and increase linearity of response at lower concentrations; (2) expand their spectral range to red/far-red to enhance imaging depth, SNR and in vivo multiplex measurement and manipulation of multiple circuit components using two or three distinct colors, and (3) characterize the possible interference of current sensors with endogenous signaling and systematically validate emerging sensors with a wide-ranging microscopy approaches in vivo. Our strategy relies on a dynamic collaboration between the sensor design team and end users to obtain continuous feedback to implement efficient improvements to the sensors. It is our goal to rapidly disseminate a wide range of well-characterized, highly sensitive indicators for the neuroscience community to be employed to study behaving mice, fish, flies and worms, to enrich our knowledge on the functional roles of neuromodulators in the brain circuitry. Altered neurotransmitter and neuromodulator (NM) signaling is a key feature of virtually all human neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, depression, and addiction. We will engineer, validate and disseminate optimized genetically encoded sensors for visualizing neuronal communication with enhanced depth and resolution using advanced microscopy techniques. Combined with optogenetics and calcium/voltage imaging, applications of these tools will reveal the full richness of neuromodulatory signaling to greatly extend, and potentially transform, our understanding of how neurochemical inputs influence cell and circuit function in health and disease.",Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution,10166304,U01NS120820,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Effectiveness', 'Endorphins', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Fishes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Penetration', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photometry', 'Photons', 'Property', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'design', 'environmental change', 'extracellular', 'fly', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'minimally invasive', 'monoamine', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nerve supply', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2021,869559
"Neurophysiology of Human Cortical Epilepsy ABSTRACT Epilepsy remains a devastating and poorly understood illness whose therapies are inadequate for many patients and, in large degree, unchanged for decades. The experiments proposed in this project utilize novel microelectrode recording techniques in patients with epilepsy as well as quantitative features and large data sets to obtain information about the neuronal dynamics underlying epilepsy at an unprecedented level of resolution. The primary hypothesis of this project is that this high resolution, multi-scale information can be applied to separate seizures into different classes which differ in the mechanisms which underlie seizure initiation. More specifically, we will be examining the role and interplay of widespread networks, different cortical layers, infraslow activity and both excitatory and inhibitory single neuronal activity as seizures start. We expect to find substantial differences in these different features of neural action in different kinds of seizures. This knowledge will foster the development of a more complete understanding of seizures and how they can be better detected, predicted and ultimately controlled.

"The cerebro-cerebellar-basal-gangliar network for visuomotor learning ABSTRACT Visual learning is critical to the lives of human and non-human primates. Visuomotor association, the assignment of an arbitrary symbol to a particular movement (like a red light to a braking movement), is a well- studied form of visual learning. This proposal tests the hypothesis that the brain accomplishes visuomotor associative learning using an anatomically defined closed-loop network, including the prefrontal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. In our preliminary work we have developed a task that studies how monkeys learn to associate one of two novel fractal symbols with a right hand movement, and the other symbol with a left hand movement. Every experiment begins with the monkeys responding to two overtrained symbols that they have seen hundreds of thousands of times. At an arbitrary time we change the symbols to two fractal symbols that the monkey has never seen. It takes the monkey 40 to 70 trials to learn the new associations. In our preliminary results we have discovered that Purkinje cells in the midlateral cerebellar hemisphere track the monkeys’ learning as they as they figure out the required associations. The neurons signal the result of the prior decision. Half of the neurons respond more when the prior decision was correct; the others respond more when the prior decision was wrong. The difference between the activity of these two types of neurons provides a cognitive error signal that is maximal when the monkeys are performing at a chance level, and gradually becomes not different from zero as the monkeys learn the task. The neurons do not predict the result of the impending decision. Although the neurons change their activity dramatically at the symbol switch, the kinematics of the movements do not change at all. This proposal takes this discovery as the starting point for four aims: 1) to use viral transynaptic tract tracing to discover the cortical and basal ganglia regions that project to the cerebellar visuomotor association area. 2) to record from the four nodes of the network as anatomically defined (midlateral cerebellar hemisphere, dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, prefrontal cortex), simultaneously, using multiple single neuron recordings, to see if these areas also have information about the process of visuomotor association 3) to inactivate each node, to see how their inactivation affects the monkey’s ability to learn new associations, and whether the inactivation affects the activity of the neurons at the other nodes. 4) to develop computational methods to analyze the activity of neural activity recorded simultaneously in all four nodes of the network (Aim 2) in the midlateral cerebellar cortex with regard to parameters such as prior outcome and movement, hand, symbol, and the intensity and epoch of the prior cognitive error signal. We will use dimensional reduction techniques to answer questions like whether hand or symbol can be decoded from network activity. We will model how the cerebellum simple spike cognitive error signal might propagate through the network and be used to facilitate visuomotor association learning and the processing of signals in the cerebellum, basal ganglia and cerebral cortex Project Narrative Learning that a particular object cues a particular action, as a red light makes us stop walking or brake the car, is critical for human behavior and can be degraded by human disease. This project will apply physiological, computational, and anatomical methods to investigate a brain network for visual learning.

"Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The mammalian visual cortex is critical for vision and has been used as a model for the rest of the cerebral cortex. In spite of this, little is known about the detailed operations of its microcircuits. In fact, the cortex is composed of many different cell types, and, it is likely that each cell type has a particular circuit function.  In the past cycle we focused on four major subtypes of cortical GABAergic interneurons (PV, SOM, VIP and chandeliers) in mouse visual cortex, using two- photon photoactivation and transgenic mice to map connections to and from interneurons in a systematic fashion. We found that interneurons often make synaptic connections with every single neighboring cell, and this promiscuity could be an important feature of the cortical inhibitory “circuit blueprint”.  In the course of these experiments we unexpectedly discovered that groups of coactive neurons, which we termed “neuronal ensembles”, account for the majority of the cortical response to visual stimuli. Moreover, ensembles also dominate spontaneous activity and have distinct spatiotemporal characteristics. Further, using two-photon optogenetics we found by chance that ensembles can be artificially imprinted into the cortex and they can be recalled by stimulating individual neurons, showing pattern completion, even days after imprinting. These intriguing results suggest that ensembles could be multicellular building blocks of cortical function, implementing a population neural code.  To pursue this discovery and test these ideas we now propose an experimental “deep dive” into the properties of these ensembles, in order to characterize their basic phenomenology, understand their synaptic circuit mechanisms and test their role in the behavior of the animal in sensory discrimination. The project will be carried out in primary visual cortex of awake behaving mice and make use of a novel two-photon holographic microscopy method that enables us to image and optically manipulate neurons in different cortical layers simultaneously.  Our work will provide a systematic anatomical and functional description of neuronal ensembles, how they regulate the activity of the cortex and how they can be manipulated and reconfigured. This could help in novel therapeutic strategies by reconfiguring pathological circuits and correct visual deficits. Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex The role of coordinated neuronal activity by groups of neurons in the visual cortex is still poorly understood. In the last cycle of the grant we discovered that one can reconfigure cortical activity in mouse visual cortex using optogenetics, by imprinting and recalling artificial activity patterns, and we now propose to understand how these patterns are build and whether their manipulation can lead to changes in behavior. This work could help to understand how neural circuits in the visual cortex operate and can be altered and also help to design novel strategies to ameliorate amblyopia and cortical cerebral visual impairment by reconfiguring abnormal circuits.  ",Imaging Functional Connectivity in Visual Cortex,10169447,R01EY011787,"['3-Dimensional', 'Amblyopia', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computational algorithm', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epidemic', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neocortex', 'Neurons', 'Optical Methods', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Perceptual learning', 'Population', 'Premature Infant', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'area striata', 'awake', 'cell type', 'cortical visual impairment', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'imprint', 'in vivo', 'mouse genetics', 'nerve supply', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'phenomenological models', 'photoactivation', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory discrimination', 'spatiotemporal', 'two-photon', 'visual stimulus']",NEI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2021,384357
"Sound encoding by neural populations in auditory cortex during behavior Project Summary Throughout life, humans and other animals adapt their hearing to perceive features of sound that are important for successful behavioral decisions. Normal-hearing humans are able to detect and discriminate important sounds in crowded noisy scenes and to understand the speech of individuals the first time they meet. However, patients with peripheral hearing loss or central processing disorders often have problems hearing in these challenging settings. Even when they can perceive sounds accurately, the additional listening effort required negatively impacts other cognitive functions. A better understanding of how the healthy auditory system operates in cognitively challenging contexts will support new treatments for these deficits. This project will study how the auditory system represents sound information as it operates in challenging acoustic environments. There are three specific aims. First, high-density microelectrode arrays will be used to record the simultaneous activity of neural populations in auditory cortex during behaviors that require detecting sounds masked by noise or learning new sound-reward associations. Recording from multiple neurons will enable characterizing how information is encoded by the simultaneous activity of neural populations. These experiments will test the hypothesis that population activity in auditory cortex generates representations that are invariant to irrelevant distracting sounds. Second, optogenetic tools will be used to identify distinct neuronal cell types (excitatory versus inhibitory) in cortex. This study will test the hypothesis that tonic activation of inhibitory neurons can explain changes in population activity during behavior. Third, machine learning tools will be used to model the simultaneously recorded neural activity. These experiments will test the hypothesis that neurons in the same local anatomical circuit in auditory cortex encode information about a relatively small domain in the space of all possible auditory stimuli. Models fit to experimental data will also describe how changes in behavioral state shift the way neurons encode sounds and describe sources of correlated population activity that impact neural discriminability during behavior. Together these experiments will establish new links between neural representation of sound and the cognitive processes that extract important information from sound for successful behavior. Project Narrative Patients with hearing impairment and central neurological disorders have difficulty keeping track of speech and other complex sounds, particularly in challenging noisy environments. We seek to understand how populations of neurons in auditory cortex change their activity as the brain adapts to noisy environments. These experiments will provide insight into basic function of the healthy brain that can inform treatment of hearing disorders.",Sound encoding by neural populations in auditory cortex during behavior,10302718,R01DC014950,"['Acoustics', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory Perceptual Disorders', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Categories', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Enhancers', 'Environment', 'Ferrets', 'Frequencies', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interneurons', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microelectrodes', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Operating System', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Pupil', 'Reporting', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Virus', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive process', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'excitatory neuron', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'frontal lobe', 'hearing impairment', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural model', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'receptive field', 'relating to nervous system', 'sound', 'tool']",NIDCD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,320591
"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,10159320,R01NS112326,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clathrin', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exocytosis', 'Extracellular Space', 'Frequencies', 'Growth Cones', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'PHluorin', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Regulation of Exocytosis', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'SNAP receptor', 'Side', 'Stretching', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus', 'Time', 'Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'axon guidance', 'cell behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'synaptogenesis', 'vesicular SNARE proteins']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,384007
"Dense Analysis of Cortical Circuit Dysfunction in the MECP2-duplication Syndrome of Autism Multiple hypotheses have been put forward regarding cortical circuit dysfunction in autism, including: excitation to inhibition (E/I) imbalance, hyper- or hypo- connectivity profiles, abnormal processing along the cortical column, increased variability of sensory encoding, failure of “canonical” cortical computations, and others. Nevertheless, we currently lack a detailed mechanistic understanding of how cortical circuits malfunction during sensory processing in autism. This critical knowledge deficit needs to be corrected. Identifying common themes of neural circuit dysfunction in autism would yield new targets for intervention, potentially opening new windows for restoring function. Methyl-CpG-binding-protein-2 (MECP2) duplication syndrome is caused by duplication of the MECP2 gene, leading to progressive intellectual disability and autism in males with 100% penetrance. It is the “mirror image” of Rett syndrome, caused by loss of MECP2 function. Abnormal synaptic plasticity and E/I imbalance have been causally implicated in both MECP2-disorders and autism in general and are known to affect cortical function. Notably, we and others have shown that visual function is abnormal in MECP2-syndromes. Visual cortex, a prototypical “low level” sensory area, renders itself optimally for studying cortical sensory processing. Here, we mount a comprehensive effort to understand how sensory processing fails in MECP2-duplication syndrome, by studying the visual cortex. Recent advances will allow us for the first time to map densely, at single cell resolution, the functional properties and connectome of a cortical column, one of the fundamental modules of cortical computation, in the MECP2-duplication mouse model of autism (aim #1). This will be followed by a detailed electro-physiological connectivity analysis of the cortical circuit to probe underlying mechanisms (aim #2). Data obtained will be used in conjunction with deep learning techniques to create a sophisticated neuro-realistic model of the cortical circuit, which will allow a detailed, “in computo,” interrogation of the mechanism of dysfunction and how to ameliorate it (aim #3). Hypotheses formulated “in computo” can then be tested optogenetically, closing the loop. Expectations: 1) Obtain the first comprehensive picture of how early sensory processing fails in this model of autism. 2) Identify specific sub-network connectivity defects reflecting abnormal interneuronal connectivity and E/I balance, 3) Construct a neuro-realistic model of the cortical microcircuit, which can be used to uncover “in computo” the mechanism of dysfunction and to probe how one might intervene to repair it. Finally, we will 4) develop a systematic framework, within which to categorize cortical processing and dysfunction in autism. In the future, additional models of autism will be brought into this fold to be categorized and systematically studied. Multiple hypotheses have been put forward regarding cortical circuit dysfunction in autism spectrum disorders. Nevertheless, we currently lack a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of how cortical circuits malfunction during sensory processing in autism. Here we undertake an effort to densely map cortical circuit properties and connectivity in the MECP2-duplication syndrome of autism and use this information to create a neuro-realistic cortical circuit model, which will allow a detailed, “in computo,” interrogation of the mechanism of dysfunction and how to ameliorate it. 1",Dense Analysis of Cortical Circuit Dysfunction in the MECP2-duplication Syndrome of Autism,10121643,R01NS113890,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Cortical Column', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Image', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Maps', 'MeCP2 Duplication Syndrome', 'Methods', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Penetrance', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Retina', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Sensory', 'Slice', 'Stimulus', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Visual Cortex', 'area V1', 'area striata', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'cortex mapping', 'deep learning', 'design', 'excitatory neuron', 'expectation', 'functional restoration', 'improved functioning', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'mouse model', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'optogenetics', 'patch clamp', 'repaired', 'therapeutic target', 'two-photon', 'visual processing']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,694774
"Motor Modulation of Auditory Processing Project Summary Vocal communication depends on distinguishing our own vocal sounds (vocal feedback) from other sounds. Vocal motor-related corollary discharge (vocal CD) signals that suppress auditory responses to predictable vocal feedback help make this distinction. Notably, vocal CD signals in the human auditory cortex are especially important to speech and their dysfunction is thought to cause auditory hallucinations. Despite the key roles postulated for vocal CD signals, the challenges of monitoring and manipulating their activity in vocalizing animals has prevented systematic analyses. The long-term objective of this application is to understand with synaptic, cellular, and circuit resolution how vocal CD signals modulate auditory cortical responses to vocal feedback, detailed knowledge of which is essential to understand adaptive and maladaptive aspects of audition. We will gain detailed knowledge of synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms underlying this process by studying the mouse, the vertebrate most suited to advanced genetic, electrophysiological, and optical tools. In the prior funding period, we used these tools to advance our understanding the synaptic and circuit mechanisms by which movement-related CD signals modulate auditory cortical activity. These advances included mapping a motor to auditory cortical circuit, determining that various head and body movements activate this pathway to suppress auditory cortical responses to sounds, and showing that this pathway can “learn” to selectively suppress sounds that are predictably yoked to locomotor movements. We also observed auditory cortical suppression in vocalizing male mice, but vocalization occurred during female courtship and was always accompanied by other movements, as well as by social and sexual stimuli. Therefore, whether vocalization-specific CD signals modulate the auditory cortex and suppress predictable vocal feedback remain unknown. Fortunately, we also developed methods for optogenetically gating ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and for distorting vocal feedback in the isolated, head-fixed mouse. Here we propose to combine these methods with other state of the art techniques, including multi-electrode arrays, in vivo multiphoton imaging, controlled manipulation of vocalization-related auditory feedback, and novel computational methods for voco-acoustic analysis. In the first Aim, we will test the idea that vocalization suppresses auditory cortical activity and use machine learning methods to rigorously quantify and compare spontaneous and optogenetically-evoked USVs. In the second Aim, we will isolate cortical contributions to the vocal modulation of auditory cortical activity. In the third Aim, we will distort vocal feedback to determine if vocal suppression of the auditory cortex is predictive, and use computational methods to systematically quantify vocal distortion. Together, these Aims will provide novel insights into the synaptic, cellular, and circuit mechanisms by which vocal CD signals influence auditory cortical processing. Project Narrative Normal hearing depends on the brain’s ability to anticipate and suppress responses to self-generated vocal sounds, while impaired suppression generates auditory hallucinations. We aim to show how vocal motor signals suppress auditory activity in the brain, thus informing how hearing works in health and disease.",Motor Modulation of Auditory Processing,10121250,R01DC013826,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Hallucination', 'Auditory area', 'Auditory system', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bone Conduction', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Courtship', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Feedback', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Locomotion', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Optical Methods', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Environment', 'Speech', 'Stimulus', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ultrasonics', 'Variant', 'Work', 'auditory feedback', 'auditory processing', 'auditory stimulus', 'autoencoder', 'deaf', 'excitatory neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'inhibitory neuron', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'multi-electrode arrays', 'multiphoton imaging', 'neural circuit', 'normal hearing', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'response', 'social', 'sound', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'unsupervised learning', 'vocalization']",NIDCD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,429899
"Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Project Summary: Considerable evidence exists to support the notion that amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology impair neuronal circuit integrity and function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Unfortunately, few studies have tested the direct influence of AD pathology on spatial computation within affected neuronal populations, resulting in an information gap at the neuronal network level. Moreover, in vivo experiments that examine large scale, neuronal network activity in mouse models of Aβ and tau pathology are lacking. In this proposal, I test the overarching hypothesis that Aβ and tau associated neuronal network dysfunction impairs task-relevant, spatial information encoding in large populations of neurons within the EC-HIPP circuit, and that combating this aberrant activity can restore order and improve spatial information processing in AD mice. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that oligomeric forms of Aβ and tau disturb spatial information content encoded within large populations of neurons in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit. I will also test if these oligomeric peptides alter the number of neurons recruited into the population code responsible for memory encoding in a spatial learning and memory task. In Aims 2 & 3, I will leverage the predictive power of machine learning to decipher the neural code for spatial information processing in EC-HIPP population activity. Specifically, my goals in Aim 2 will be to examine the individual and combined impact of Aβ and tau pathologies on features of spatial information encoding in the EC-Tau/hAPP mouse line. In Aim 3, I will employ chemogenetics using a novel DREADDs ligand to combat aberrant neuronal activity in AD mouse models, with the ultimate goal of improving spatial information processing in neuronal networks burdened with pathology. Excitatory neurons will be specifically targeted in an effort to better understand their contribution to impaired spatial information processing in AD mouse models.  The proposed research aims are designed to bridge an information gap between AD-related cognitive impairment and the underlying circuit pathology. This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Award will afford me the opportunity to accomplish this major goal while enriching my technical skillset and expanding my knowledge of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the integrated training and mentorship that I will receive will help me develop additional expertise in machine learning for spatial decoding analyses. Together, the proposed studies and career development plan will ensure that I achieve my long-term career goal of launching a competitive, independent research career at a major research university. Project Narrative The progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with dysfunctional neuronal signaling and poor cognitive performance. In this proposal, newly developed machine learning strategies will be used to decode features of task-relevant, spatial information from neural ensemble activity in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit of transgenic mice expressing Aβ and tau pathology, with the overarching goal of understanding how Aβ and tau interfere with spatial information encoded within neuronal networks. Dysfunctional neuronal populations will then be selectively targeted using chemogenetics to correct their aberrant firing patterns, with the aim of improving the quality of spatial information carried by pathology afflicted neuronal networks.",Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice,10237353,K01AG068598,"['4-Hydroxy-Tamoxifen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'J20 mouse', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'abeta accumulation', 'attenuation', 'awake', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive performance', 'combat', 'design', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'entorhinal cortex', 'excitatory neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'learning strategy', 'memory encoding', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatial memory', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2021,106388
