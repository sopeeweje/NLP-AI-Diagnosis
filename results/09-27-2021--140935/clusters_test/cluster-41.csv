"Septohippocampal circuit deep brain stimulation for selective RDoC aspects of cognition Project Summary The septohippocampal circuit plays a crucial role in multiple cognitive Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains, including memory, attention, anxiety, and sensorimotor processing. This circuit is comprised primarily of the medial septal nucleus (MSN), hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Pharmacological and genetic models targeting glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction within this circuit result in memory deficits, difficulty with attention, and social interaction impairments. Therefore, we are studying the relationship between MSN-mPFC- hippocampal oscillatory activity in NMDA receptor hypofunction models to better create treatments for disrupted theta and gamma oscillations which are altered in a variety of psychiatric disorders. Recent evidence suggests that deep brain stimulation (DBS) may be one such promising treatment modality for circuit disorders. This NIMH K08 Career Development Award will provide the necessary foundation for Darrin J. Lee, MD, PhD to pursue the development of novel DBS techniques for septohippocampal circuit disorders. The project and training plan are rooted in the electrophysiological and molecular underpinnings of NMDA receptor hypofunction, while concomitantly enabling the candidate to collaborate with and learn from his mentors and consultants. This program will enable him to supplement his current skillsets in areas where he has identified gaps in his knowledge base, including relevant research methodology, study design, machine learning, and structural connectivity. The proposed research will focus on 1) characterizing neural oscillations within the septohippocampal circuit in two complementary models of NMDA receptor hypofunction (pharmacological: chronic MK-801 administration and genetic: parvalbumin interneuron-selective NR1 knockout); 2) evaluating the cognitive effects of DBS in these rodent models, and 3) evaluating the relationship between electrophysiological biomarkers and behavior using machine learning. The interpretation of data from this research will improve understanding of specific electrophysiological aspects of impaired brain function in septohippocampal circuit disorders and serve as a catalyst for a research program centered on neuromodulation for these disorders. Moreover, data collected, skills procured, and collaborations developed will enable Dr. Lee to seek R01 funding and obtain career independence. Taken together, the data collected, and training developed will ultimately facilitate development of an investigator with unique skills in service of ameliorating suffering caused by septohippocampal circuit disorders. Project Narrative Current treatments for psychiatric disorders with deficits in cognitive and emotional Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) domains have limited efficacy, necessitating more effective treatment strategies. Disorders with NMDA receptor hypofunction lead to septohippocampal circuit dysfunction and circuit-specific cognitive dysfunction. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) alters focal and diffuse networks and has recently been posited as a treatment for psychiatric disorders. This project aims to evaluate the the role of electrophysiological networks involved in NMDA receptor hypofunction and utilize DBS to improve cognitive behavior.",Septohippocampal circuit deep brain stimulation for selective RDoC aspects of cognition,10161859,K08MH121757,"['Acute', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Epilepsy', 'Etiology', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Exhibits', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Glutamates', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knock-out', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'MK801', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Medial Septal Nucleus', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptors', 'N-methyl-D-glutamate', 'NR1 gene', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pacemakers', 'Parvalbumins', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizoaffective Disorders', 'Schizophrenia', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'basal forebrain', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral outcome', 'career', 'catalyst', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'effective therapy', 'functional restoration', 'genetic approach', 'improved', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prepulse inhibition', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'septohippocampal', 'skills', 'targeted biomarker', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K08,2021,196326
"Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory Project Summary Our proposal seeks to build upon the success of our lab investigating the electrophysiology of human memory through novel experiments that will elucidate hippocampal—parietal interactions in memory processing. The key innovations of this proposal are the application of direct brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex and the adaptation of an associative recognition paradigm to intracranial data. We will take advantage of our high-volume epilepsy surgical center specializing in stereo EEG electrode implantation. In our first aim, we will compare how electrophysiological patterns of brain activation differ between free recall (which comprises the bulk of intracranial memory data) and associative recognition, specifically examining properties of theta oscillations in the anterior versus posterior hippocampus. In the second aim, we will apply deep brain stimulation to the mesial parietal cortex during memory encoding and retrieval, observing differences in memory performance and hippocampal oscillatory activity that will inform hypotheses of how this area supports episodic memory. In Aim 3, we will use machine learning classifiers to understand how mesial parietal stimulation affects memory performance via its impact on brain oscillatory activity in a responsive stimulation paradigm. These experiments will utilize our lab’s knowledge and infrastructure gained through participation in the DARPA Restoring Active Memory project. While our proposal is highly innovative, our center’s proven success in recruiting a large volume of stereo EEG patients for memory research, data collection, and the application of advanced analytic techniques give us confidence that we will collect high quality data addressing the critical gaps in the understanding of human memory. Project Narrative Two critical gaps in our understanding of human memory are whether or not hippocampal theta oscillations support encoding in the same manner as in rodents, and the contribution of the mesial parietal cortex in encoding versus retrieval. These questions are closely linked together, and we propose to study them in stereo EEG patients using a novel memory paradigm coupled with deep brain stimulation. Our planned experiments include a closed-loop stimulation paradigm seeking to use parietal stimulation to improve memory performance, the results of which will both inform theories of human episodic memory processing and of the design of therapeutic brain stimulation devices to treat cognitive deficits.",Using deep brain stimulation of the parietal cortex to investigate the electrophysiology of human episodic memory,10348398,R01NS107357,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Animal Experiments', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Episodic memory', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infrastructure', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Liver', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Societies', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'analog', 'base', 'design', 'direct application', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'human imaging', 'implantation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'memory recognition', 'memory retrieval', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'recruit', 'success', 'theories']",NINDS,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,79818
"Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation Project Summary/Abstract One of the biggest challenges to successful remembering is the potential for confusion or interference between similar memories. For every password, name, or parking space that we store in memory, there are many other passwords, names or parking spaces that we have already learned or will learn in the future. While interference is a factor in relatively benign—yet annoying—examples of ‘normal’ forgetting, it is also a major factor in clinically significant examples of forgetting that occur with aging and/or dementia. Thus, there is a fundamental need to understand the neural mechanisms that support the acquisition/retrieval of similar memories while minimizing interference and corresponding forgetting. Computational models of episodic memory have emphasized the critical role of pattern separation in reducing memory interference. Pattern separation involves coding similar memories such that differences between memories are exaggerated and the potential for confusion is thereby minimized. While there is general agreement that pattern separation is implemented by the hippocampus—and that pattern separation is important for reducing memory interference—there remain several fundamental gaps in our understanding of how, when, and why pattern separation occurs. In particular, there remains ambiguity as far as (a) the learning contexts in which each mechanism might be recruited, (b) what the corresponding neural signatures of each mechanism are, and (c) the specific behavioral consequences associated with the engagement of each mechanism. We propose a systematic investigation of the contexts in which integration and pattern separation occur with the goal of using sophisticated, cutting-edge neuroimaging (fMRI) techniques to identify distributed patterns of neural activity that are diagnostic of each mechanism. Critically, we also plan to use these observed patterns of neural activity—that is, neural evidence for integration vs. separation—to predict behavioral memory phenomena, including interference-related forgetting. The research represents a strong synthesis of psychology and neuroscience questions with an emphasis on learning mechanisms inspired by computational models and analysis approaches that draw from the fields of machine learning and data mining. Project Narrative A primary reason we forget is because we store a vast number of memories and interference between these memories becomes inevitable. While forgetting may only represent an occasional annoyance for most people, among older adults and those with dementia—groups that are growing at a disproportionate rate— memory confusion and interference-related forgetting can be debilitating problems. The proposed research seeks to identify neural mechanisms that reduce interference-related forgetting, including in younger and older adults, and will lead to fundamental new insight into how the brain resolves interference between similar memories.",Neural mechanisms for reducing interference during episodic memory formation,10123856,R01NS089729,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Benign', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory Disorders', 'Names', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Visual Cortex', 'Work', 'age related', 'clinically significant', 'data mining', 'dentate gyrus', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'forgetting', 'high resolution imaging', 'improved', 'insight', 'motivated behavior', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'young adult']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,485965
"Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding Project Summary Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the factors that promote disease risk and resilience may be distinct in men and women. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying this possibility are poorly understood, however, because the vast majority of pre- clinical animal research has been conducted in males. In addition, the behavioral outcome measures used to understand learned fear have focused predominantly on passive, or freezing behavior. We recently identified an active, escape-like conditioned fear response in rats (“darting”) that occurred almost exclusively in females and was predictive of improved extinction retention. A better understanding of potentially sexually dimorphic mechanisms that drive this behavior could open new avenues for treatment of disorders that are more prevalent in women, like PTSD. We propose here to define the neural circuitry that drives the selection of conditioned darting vs. freezing, and how that integrates with known extinction circuits to promote extinction retention. Our preliminary data implicate the infralimbic cortex (IL) in this role, and we will use pharmacological, chemogenetic, and viral techniques to probe how descending IL projections to the dorsal and ventral periaqueductal gray (PAG) may mediate a strategic switch between active and passive responding and drive long-term behavioral flexibility through putative collaterals in the amygdala. We will then use sophisticated machine vision and machine learning-based tools to define the broader behavioral repertoires within which darting exists, thereby identifying a multifaceted phenotype that could provide insight into the mechanisms underlying individual differences in stress resilience and vulnerability. Project Narrative Sex differences in the development and prevalence of mental illnesses are widespread, suggesting that the risk factors that promote disease susceptibility may be distinct in men and women. This project explores the neurobiological basis of divergent (active vs. passive) fear responses in males and females, which could help identify novel ways to prevent or treat post-traumatic stress disorder.",Infralimbic circuit control over a sex-dependent switch in threat responding,10223137,R01MH123803,"['Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Conditioned Reflex', 'Crete', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Dorsal', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'FOS gene', 'Female', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'Individual Differences', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pain', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prevalence', 'Rattus', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sex Differences', 'Shock', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'conditioning', 'coping', 'disorder risk', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine vision', 'male', 'men', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'selective expression', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'stress resilience', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,445292
"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,10226122,R01MH120158,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotional functioning', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'millisecond', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'preclinical study', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,706855
"Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale Project Summary This project aims to leverage the best of both computational and human expertise in neuronal reconstruction towards the goal of accelerating global neuroscience discovery from internationally-sourced imaging data. We propose to create a cloud-based unified platform for converging 3-dimensional images of neurons onto a single analysis platform to (1) train and grow a new expert community of global reconstructors to work across the data from these groups, to (2) generate a community-sourced neuronal reconstruction database of open imaging data that can be incorporated into a 3-dimensional map of neuronal interconnectivity - onto which (3) novel annotations and more complex functional and molecular data can be overlaid. Our approach will evolve with the growing needs of the neuroscience community over time. To do this, in Aim One (Neuronal Reconstruction at Scale), we will test if the newly developed crowd-sourced game-based platform Mozak can develop a collective of new human experts at scale, capable of accelerating the rate of current reconstruction by at least an order of magnitude, at the same time as increasing the robustness, quality and unbiasedness of the final reconstructions. In Aim Two (Robust Multi-Purpose Annotation), we will enhance basic neuronal reconstruction by adding specific semantic annotation— including soma volume and morphological quantification, volumetric analysis, and ongoing features (e.g. dendritic spines, axonal varicosities) requested from the neuroscience community. Experienced and high-ranking members will be given the opportunity to advance through increasingly complex neurons into full arbor brain-wide neuronal projections and multiple clustered groups of neurons in localized circuits. Finally, in Aim 3 (Creation of a Research-Adaptive Data Repository), we aim to develop a database of neuronal images reconstructed using the Mozak interface that will directly serve the general and specific needs of different research groups. Our goal is to make this database dynamically adaptive — as new research questions will invariably bring new needs for additional annotations and cross-referencing with other data modalities. This highquality unbiased processing repository will also be perfectly suited for training sets for automated algorithms, and the generation of a 3-dimensional maps such as Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) common coordinate framework. We expect that the computational reconstruction methods will further improve with the new large corpus of “gold standard” reconstructions. Collectively, the completion of these three aims will create an analysis suite as well as an online community of experts capable of performing in depth analysis of large-scale datasets that will significantly accelerate neuroscience research, enhance machine learning for reconstruction analysis, and create a common platform of baseline neuronal morphology data against which aberrantly functioning neurons can be analyzed. Project Narrative  This project will create a new central nexus point for neuronal reconstruction and semantic annotation (Mozak) that can be used by all research labs via an accessible online portal. We will develop a new cadre of neuronal reconstruction experts that will— in conjunction with automated tools that are enhanced by their work — drastically increase the volume, quality and robustness of neuron reconstructions and annotations. Mozak reconstructions will be shared with existing repositories and will be continually updated and re-annotated based on emerging needs of research - ensuring perpetual relevance, and allowing us to generate a platform to establish the range of “baseline” 3-dimensional readouts of neuronal morphology against which diseased or malfunctioning neurons can be analyzed and understood. 1",Mozak: Creating an Expert Community to accelerate neuronal reconstruction at scale,10204729,R01MH116247,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Process', 'Research', 'Science', 'Semantics', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Varicosity', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'citizen science', 'cloud based', 'crowdsourcing', 'data repository', 'experience', 'improved', 'large scale data', 'member', 'neuronal cell body', 'novel', 'online community', 'petabyte', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'repository', 'tool', 'two-dimensional', 'web portal']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,639861
"Neural Encoding of Social Information PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Vocal communication plays a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of social interactions and is impaired in a wide range of neurological disorders. Consequently, a major component of translational research focuses on identifying circuit-level neurobiological mechanisms underlying social communication deficits. Determining the neural mechanisms underlying social communication deficits requires both understanding the functions of neural circuits as well as the ability to link neural circuits to specific naturalistic behaviors. However, obtaining this information has been challenging because of the difficulties in interpreting complex behavioral interactions in freely socializing animals. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the neural circuitry controlling naturalistic social behaviors directly influenced by communication. This could ultimately allow communication disorders to be treated by therapeutically targeting atypically functioning neural circuitry. In pursuit of this goal, the overall objective in this proposal is to determine how social communication is encoded in the nervous system and the role it plays in shaping behavior. The proposal uses a novel microphone array system to track the vocal behavior of freely socializing, individual adult mice—a technique that has eluded the field for 50 years. Coupling this innovative method with in vivo wireless electrophysiology and machine-learning techniques used for robustly extracting meaningful social information will enable identification of the neural circuits that encode social communication and the role communication plays in directly shaping social behavior. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that mice emit behavior-dependent vocalizations that directly alter the social dynamics between animals. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that behaviorally-dependent vocalizations are encoded in the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that the lateral entorhinal cortex, one of the primary cortical inputs to CA2, encodes the locations of vocalizations in egocentric reference frames. The proposed research will have a broad impact as these studies will provide fundamental insight into the neurobiological basis of social communication. Moreover, these experiments will lay the groundwork for future studies examining the neural basis of social communication in mouse models of neurological disorders, such as schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, and autism spectrum disorders. Project Narrative:  Understanding the fundamental principles governing social communication is of paramount importance as deficits in expressive and receptive vocal communication skills are hallmark characteristics of a wide range of neurological disorders. The proposed experiments aim to determine the direct impact of social communication on behavior and delineate how neural circuits encode social communication. Ultimately, knowledge gained from the proposed project has the potential to inform and hasten the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches that will help reduce the burdens of human disability.",Neural Encoding of Social Information,10183334,R01MH122752,"['Acoustics', 'Adult', 'Agonistic Behavior', 'Animal Disease Models', 'Animals', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Characteristics', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mus', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pattern', 'Pheromone', 'Play', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Translational Research', 'Wireless Technology', 'affiliative behavior', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'entorhinal cortex', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'free behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mature animal', 'microphone', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'social communication', 'sound', 'source localization', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'vocalization']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2021,618061
"Rapid Evaluation of Neuronal Activity in the Intact Whole Brain at Single Cell Resolution Project Summary  Here we seek to develop a “Neuronal Activity Quantitative Diagnostic” platform and reagent kits to disseminate accessible products for measuring recent neural activity across the entire mouse brain to the neuroscience community. Previously we have shown that the activity-dependent immediate-early gene protein products Npas4 and cFos can be clearly detected, imaged, and quantified using developmental versions of our platform tools. Immediate early genes are genes that are activated transiently and rapidly in response to a wide variety of cellular stimuli. The three overlapping aims to be investigated in this Phase II project are:  1) Demonstration of the fidelity of our assay for our customers. To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our neuronal activity assay with another well-known assay for activity, we will perform two photon calcium fluorescence imaging in the primary visual cortex of mice presented with repeated visual stimuli. We will clear and stain the brains for cFos and Npas4 and demonstrate the fidelity of these markers for detecting recently active neurons.  2) Develop and beta test robust versions of our software tools useable by researchers with no specialized coding or statistics knowledge. We will develop Stitchy and BrainSnap into robust, user-friendly software products that remove the current analysis bottleneck for neuroscientists interested in whole-brain imaging. Stitchy will be an improved browser-based version of our internal software that simplifies and speeds the process of stitching together light sheet microscope images. BrainSnap software will integrate our high-performance 3TK- Quant framework for machine learning-enabled quantification and our statistical framework for whole-brain anatomics, 3TK-Stats, in a browser-based interface. We have recruited end users who will test this software in a head-to-head comparison with our in-house testing.  3) Develop and test a brain clearing and staining kit for neuronal activity. To help researchers produce high quality cleared brains stained with neuronal activity markers, we will generate Neuronal Activity clearing and staining reagents kits for cFos and Npas4. These will be tested by collaborators in head-to-head comparisons with our in-house procedures on brains prepared in parallel.  At the end of Phase II, Translucence will have a market-ready Neuronal Activity Quantitative Diagnostic platform including reagent kits, user-friendly software, and service options. Project Narrative Translucence uses cutting-edge technology to make brains optically clear coupled with computational tools to map and quantify neuronal activity at single-cell resolution across the entire mouse brain.

"Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit Abstract The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated, well-timed movements. The cerebellar cortex seems to have a particular role in learning to time movements. Since the 1960's and 70's, we have known the architecture of the cerebellar microcircuit, but most analyses of cerebellar function during behavior have focused on Purkinje cells. Here, we propose to investigate the cerebellar cortex at an entirely new level by asking how the full cerebellar microcircuit – mossy fiber, granule cells, Golgi cells, molecular layer interneurons, and Purkinje cells – performs neural computations during motor behavior and motor learning. We strive to “crack” the circuit by identifying all elements, recording their electrical activity during movement and learning, and reconstructing a neural circuit model that reproduces the biological data. We will use three established learning systems that all can learn predictive timing: classical conditioning of the eyelid response (mice), predictive timing of forelimb movements (mice), and direction learning in smooth pursuit eye movements (monkeys). Our proposal has six key features. First, optogenetics (in mice) will link the discharge of different cerebellar interneurons during movement and learning to their molecular cell types. Second, a machine-learning clustering analysis (in mice and monkeys) will find analogies among the cell populations recorded in our three preparations and will classify neurons according to their putative cell types based on recordings of many parameters of non-Purkinje cells during movement and motor learning. Third, multi- contact electrodes will allow us to record simultaneously from multiple neighboring single neurons and compute spike-timing cross-correlograms (CCGs) to identify the sign of connections; we also will look for changes in CCGs that provide evidence of specific sites of plasticity during learning. Fourth, gCAMP imaging of the granule cell layer will reveal the temporal structure of inputs to the cerebellar microcircuit, and determine whether those inputs are modified in relation to motor learning. Fifth, a model neural network with realistic cerebellar architecture will reveal a single set of model parameters that will transform the measured inputs to the cerebellum in our three movement systems to the measured responses of all neurons in the cerebellar cortex. Sixth, the model will elucidate how mechanisms of synaptic and cellular plasticity at different sites in the cerebellar microcircuit work together to cause motor learning. Project Narrative The cerebellum is critical for learning and executing coordinated and well-timed movements. A better understanding of how the cerebellar circuit works and learns will be important for improving human health in cases of stroke, neuro-degenerative motor disease, developmental motor disorders, and adult movement disorders.",Canonical computations for motor learning by the cerebellar cortex micro-circuit,10155611,R01NS112917,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brush Cell', 'Cells', 'Cerebellar Cortex', 'Cerebellum', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collection', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Electrodes', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Forelimb', 'Goals', 'Golgi Apparatus', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Interneurons', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Monkeys', 'Motor Activity', 'Movement', 'Movement Disorders', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Preparation', 'Property', 'Purkinje Cells', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Smooth Pursuit', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of molecular layer of cerebellar cortex', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'cell type', 'classical conditioning', 'commune', 'design', 'experimental study', 'eyeblink conditioning', 'eyelid conditioning', 'granule cell', 'improved', 'learned behavior', 'mossy fiber', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor disorder', 'motor learning', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'statistics', 'theories']",NINDS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1275271
"Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The hippocampus is critical for the formation and consolidation of spatial memories and contributes to other cognitive tasks through its efferent projections. The goal of this project is to determine whether altered neuronal network activity in the hippocampus of an autism mouse model propagates to, and alters distal cortical regions involved in social behaviors.  One of the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, such as Rett syndrome (RTT), is a deficit in social interaction. In mice, similar social behavior impairments can be modeled by altering the excitation and inhibition (E/I) balance in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For RTT, knocking out the gene that is mutated in humans, Mecp2, causes hyperactivity in the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) due to an E/I imbalance driven by impaired inhibition and enhanced excitation, resulting in saturated synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses. Intriguingly, CA1 pyramidal neurons of the vHIP project their axons to the mPFC, making direct monosynaptic connections with excitatory pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons. We propose to characterize how the vHIP influences mPFC activity through this long-range monosynaptic glutamatergic projection. Importantly, we will test whether altered vHIP network activity is causal to mPFC dysfunction and deficits in social interaction. We hypothesize that atypically strong vHIP afferents alter network activity in the mPFC of Mecp2 KO mice by affecting the E/I balance and synaptic plasticity, which in turn contributes to social interaction deficits. To test this hypothesis, we will identify the cellular targets of direct vHIP afferents in the mPFC of RTT mice and characterize their function in social behaviors using a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, ex vivo and in vivo electrophysiology and Ca2+ imaging, anterograde and retrograde tract tracing, and unbiased machine-learning behavioral assessments.  We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) identify and characterize the cellular targets of the monosynaptic projection from the vHIP to the mPFC in Mecp2 KO mice; 2) characterize long-term synaptic plasticity of the vHIP-mPFC projection in Mecp2 KO mice; and 3) determine if chemogenetic modulation of the activity of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons alters mPFC function and social behaviors.  These studies will provide fundamental information on the functional and structural properties of the long- range connection between the vHIP and mPFC in the developing brain. The impact of this work extends beyond RTT to other neuropsychiatric disorders in which propagation of network dysfunction from the hippocampus to the mPFC is believed to contribute to cognitive deficits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome is a syndromic autism-spectrum disorder that presents with deficits in social behaviors and cognitive abilities, which may result from impaired function of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The proposed study is the first characterization of a long-range monosynaptic connection in Rett mice using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and will test whether hippocampal hyperactivity propagates to the medial prefrontal cortex, leading to autism-related social deficits.",Role of the Hippocampal-mPFC Pathway in Social Memory Deficits in Autism,10087555,R01MH118563,"['Affect', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Contralateral', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Equilibrium', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Image', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impairment', 'Interneurons', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Label', 'Link', 'Long-Term Depression', 'Long-Term Potentiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Membrane', 'Memory impairment', 'Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Mutate', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Pathway interactions', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Rett Syndrome', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Potentials', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'cellular targeting', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive task', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'experimental study', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'postnatal development', 'response', 'social', 'social deficits', 'spatial memory', 'voltage sensitive dye']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2021,393603
"The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis A comprehensive understanding of nervous system function requires integration of multiple types of data, from behavioral to anatomical. Ultimately function can be reduced to the patterns of connectivity between cells and the activation of single neurons. In this application we propose a set of aims that makes use of a unique organism with optimal qualities for multimodal nervous system investigation: the simple chordate, Ciona intestinalis. The anatomy of the Ciona larval tadpole CNS shows strong conservation with the CNS of the vertebrates, including homologs of the forebrain, midbrain/hindbrain, and spinal cord. Despite these conserved vertebrate-like features the Ciona tadpole is barely 1 mm long and has only ~2500 cells. Moreover the tadpole CNS has only 177 neurons. While the development of the Ciona CNS has been the subject of investigation for many years, new research opportunities have opened with the recent completion of the Ciona tadpole CNS connectome from serial section electron microscopy. The overall goal of this proposal is to build from the connectome data to identify correlates of behavior at the level of single, identifiable neurons. This project will be the combined undertaking of three research groups with expertise in Ciona live imaging and transgenesis, computer vision and image analysis, and electron microscopy and Ciona neuroanatomy. Preliminary data presented here demonstrate that the transparency and small size of Ciona tadpoles make them ideal for live imaging of brain activity using genetically encoded Ca2+ or voltage indicators. The aims of this proposal will be, first, to expand Ciona as a model of nervous system function, including a detailed characterization of behavior, the generation of a brain atlas at cellular resolution, and the quantification of stereotypy in brain cellular anatomy and connectivity; and, second, to apply these new tools in the characterization of patterns of neuronal activity as Ciona larvae respond to sensory cues by taking advantage of state-of-the-art imaging and neural activity detection methods. The connectome makes specific and novel predictions about patterns of neural activity, and the relative simplicity of the Ciona CNS will provide an innovative system for validating such predictions. This project presents challenges in image acquisition, analysis, and multimodal integration that stretch the limits of current technology, but holds the potential to provide an unparalleled view of chordate CNS function spanning multiple levels, from behavioral to synaptic. The central nervous system plays an central role in human health yet remains one of the most poorly understood organ systems. To gain insight into how patterns of cell connectivity and activation produce behaviors we will use advanced light and electron imaging methods to explore one of the simplest chordate brains, that of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis.","The connectome and neurobiology of a novel model chordate, Ciona intestinalis",10134450,R01NS103774,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chordata', 'Ciona intestinalis', 'Complement', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrons', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Larva', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Maintenance', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Photoreceptors', 'Play', 'Prosencephalon', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning Electron Microscopy', 'Sensory', 'Sepharose', 'Sister', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stretching', 'Subcellular Anatomy', 'Swimming', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Tadpoles', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Urochordata', 'Variant', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'behavioral study', 'body system', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'confocal imaging', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'detection method', 'digital imaging', 'experience', 'hindbrain', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light intensity', 'microscopic imaging', 'multimodality', 'multiple data types', 'neural patterning', 'neuronal patterning', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatial integration', 'stereotypy', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R01,2021,527956
"Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Multi-PI: Xinyu Zhao, Meyer Jackson, University of Wisconsin-Madison. Title: Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions Understanding the complex relationships between cells, gene networks, neural circuits, and behavior requires techniques that can probe the molecular makeup of distinct types of neurons, evaluate their properties, and test their roles in higher level functions. Genes expressed within specific populations of neurons determine their electrical properties and these properties together with their synaptic connectivity collectively shape the electrical activity of neural circuits. This is especially well illustrated by a population of neurons defined by expression of the Ca2+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV). PV interneurons (PVIs) are sparsely distributed, fast-spiking cells that provide feedback and feedforward inhibition to principal neurons. One of the most well-defined network functions of PVIs is in the coordination of neuronal networks and their associated oscillations. PVIs entrain cortical networks to drive gamma oscillations (30-100 Hz) and control their frequency and strength. PVI-mediated gamma oscillations are known to have important roles in sensory processing, attention, working memory, and cognition. However, the gene networks that control PVI functions and their impact on gamma oscillations remain unclear. PVIs are readily modified by environmental conditions and experience. PV immunoreactivity increases after exploration of a novel environment, rearing under environmental enrichment (EE), and voluntary running (VR). These changes occur in brain regions associated with cognition, including hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and amygdala. The molecular mechanisms underlying PVI changes during behavioral adaptation remain unknown. Although studies suggest that behavioral adaptions affect gamma oscillations, a role for PVIs in the link between behavioral adaption and gamma oscillations has not been established. This application takes a multidisciplinary approach to address the fundamental question of how PVIs contribute to behavioral adaptations. Our overarching hypothesis is that changes in gene expression that modify the cellular properties of PVIs will alter network oscillations, enabling PVIs to serve as a critical hub in behavioral adaptations. We will determine whether behavioral adaptation mobilizes networks of genes in PVIs, and assess the contributions of these networks to PVI physiology and gamma oscillations. This project combines the unique expertise of co-PIs Zhao (genetic regulation of neurodevelopment) and Jackson (neurophysiology and neural circuits) and co-Is Roy (system biology and machine learning) and Rosenberg (computational and system neuroscience). By integrating experimental data with gene network analysis and computational modeling of multicellular networks, this work will reveal how changes in molecular/cellular properties impact the emergent properties of neural circuits. PROJECT NARRATIVE Studies of brain function in behavior and disease tend to focus on molecules, or on cells, or on systems. However, brain function depends on interactions between all these levels. This basic science project will establish a new approach that bridges the gaps between gene expression, neuronal excitability, neural circuit function during experience-induced neural plasticity and address fundamental questions about how gene networks control neuronal circuit activities, and how such relationships come into play to shape behavior.",Integration of Experience-Induced Gene Expression and Circuit Functions,10132411,R01NS105200,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Binding Proteins', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Information Networks', 'Interneuron function', 'Interneurons', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Probes', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Parvalbumins', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Property', 'Pyramidal Cells', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'electrical property', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'immunoreactivity', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal excitability', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patch clamp', 'rabies viral tracing', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'transcriptome', 'translatome', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2021,403711
"The Pathophysiological Role of Cerebellar Glia in Rett Syndrome PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Rett  syndrome  (RTT)  is  the  leading  cause  of  severe  intellectual  disability  in  girls  and  women.  Individuals  with  RTT  develop  typically  until  6-­18  months,  when  autism-­like  behaviors  and  deficits  in  purposeful  hand  use  and  speech start to develop. Loss-­of-­function mutations in the transcriptional regulator methyl-­CpG-­binding protein   2  (MECP2)  occur  in  >95%  of  RTT  cases.  Initially,  researchers  regarded  MeCP2  deficiency  in  neurons  as  the  exclusive  cause  of  RTT.  However,  recent  studies  have  revealed  that  glia  have  a  pathological  role  in  RTT  etiology. Studies have not yet uncovered the underlying cellular mechanisms of glial cell dysfunction in Mecp2  rodent  models  or  the  impact  of  this  dysfunction  on  brain  function.  In  this  study,  we  propose  to  examine  the  contribution  of  a  specific  glial  subtype,  Bergmann  glia  cells  (BGs)  in  the  cerebellum,  to  the  motor  and  social  deficits  in  RTT.  We  will  focus  on  BGs  because  (1)  cerebellar  disruption  likely  contributes  to  the  motor  and  social  deficits  in  RTT  and  (2)  BGs  are  the  major  glial  subtype  in  the  cerebellum.  We  propose  to  characterize  cerebellar  function  in  conditional  knockout  (cKO)  mice  that  lack  Mecp2  in  BGs  using  a  repertoire  of  approaches,  including  intracellular  whole-­cell  recordings,  in  vivo  recordings  of  single  units  and  local  field  potentials,  in  vivo  and  ex  vivo  imaging  of  genetically-­encoded  Ca2+,  glutamate,  and  dopamine  (DA)  sensors  (GCaMP7,  iGluSnFr,  and  dLight1.1,  respectively),  optogenetics,  chemogenetics,  near  super-­resolution  confocal  microscopy,  and  behavioral  assessments  using  unbiased  machine-­learning  approaches.  Our  preliminary results indicate deficits in BGs from Mecp2-­deficient mice, including higher expression levels of the  GluA1  subunit  of  AMPA  receptors  (AMPARs),  and  depolarized  membrane  potentials.  In  addition,  we  have  preliminary evidence of DAergic modulation of BGs through the activation of D1 receptors (D1Rs) activated by  either electrical or optogenetic stimulation of DAergic inputs to the cerebellum. Of high relevance to motor and  social symptoms in RTT, the expression levels of D1Rs, which modulate GluA1 surface insertion, are higher in  Mecp2  KO  mice.  We  hypothesize  that  BGs  in  the  cerebellum  have  a  pathophysiological  role  in  motor  and  social  deficits  in  Mecp2-­deficient  mice.  We  propose  two  Aims:  (1)  Define  cerebellar  BG  dysfunction  in  Mecp2  cKO  mice;;  (2)  Characterize  DAergic  modulation  of  cerebellar  BGs  in  Mecp2  cKO  mice.  The  proposed  studies  will elucidate the consequences of impaired DAergic modulation of astrocyte function on cerebellar-­dependent  behaviors,  which  will  have  broad  implications  not  only  for  RTT  but  also  for  other  brain  disorders  associated  with cerebellar dysfunction.     PROJECT NARRATIVE Rett syndrome (RTT), caused by MECP2 mutations, presents with stereotypic hand movements, ambulatory difficulties, and social impairments.

"Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Working memory (WM), the cognitive entity that allows for temporary storage and manipulation of informa- tion, is crucial for much of what gives life subjective meaning, and enables an individual to participate in larger society. This includes following a conversation, finding a supermarket item, planning, driving, learning new skills—most anything that requires holding in mind information from long-term memory and/or sensory input for use requires WM. As a result, WM dysfunction has devastating effects, and regrettably, millions—individuals with schizophrenia, depression, ADHD, dementia, and more—experience varying degrees of WM impairment, which is almost totally treatment resistant. Given its role in neurocognitive health and disease, understanding the mechanisms of WM is imperative. Correspondingly, this project will explore in depth the circuit basis for WM.  The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is known to be a primary orchestrator of WM, processing input from other brain regions for WM instantiation. In spatial working memory (SWM), a WM subdomain regularly studied across species, interactions of the PFC with the ventral hippocampus and mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) are considered essential, with PFC-MD interactions undergirding neural maintenance of WM content and subsequent action selection. Notably, the PFC is quite heterogeneous, being composed of layers that differ both in their cellular composition and in their connectivity. Yet the possibility that these laminar subregions might uniquely contribute to the multifaceted ways in which the PFC empowers WM is only now being explored: recent studies suggest that superficial PFC layers support WM content maintenance, while deep PFC layers support post-maintenance action selection. This proposal expands upon these studies by using novel technology to explore cellular-resolution laminar representations in WM.  Specifically, this proposal examines what WM content is encoded in the activity of individual cells vs. popula- tions in the different PFC layers (Aim 1) and assesses the dependence of these laminar WM representations on input from the MD (Aim 2). To do so, calcium imaging will be performed through microendoscopes in mice genetically and surgically specified to express calcium indicators in particular PFC layers. These mice will perform a trial-based delayed nonmatch to sample WM task in a custom-built, automated 8-armed radial maze, and for Aim 2 will have MD input to the PFC optogenetically silenced during behavior and imaging (to simulate the MD-PFC hypoconnectivity regularly observed in those with WM deficits). Finally, for rigorous mapping of behavior to neural activity, novel machine learning behavioral classification paradigms will be used.  WM provides the cognitive building blocks for the very fabric of quotidian life—sustaining social relationships, maintaining a job, living independently, learning new things and more. Given such complexity, detailed interrogation of WM circuit mechanisms is required. Accordingly, this proposal uses emerging technologies to explore circuit mechanisms of both WM function and dysfunction, advancing pursuits of therapeutic innovation. PROJECT NARRATIVE Working memory, the cognitive entity through which information can be temporarily held in mind for processing, is fundamental to many essential human activities, from holding a conversation, to walking home from the bus stop, to introspecting. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) has long been known to undergird working memory, with information maintenance empowered by input from the mediodorsal thalamus (MD), but how the different PFC layers support this complex and versatile capability remains largely unclear. This proposal will assess the neural representations in PFC layers during spatial working memory, and how they depend on MD input, to better establish circuit mechanisms for working memory instantiation, to the end of moving us closer to eventual therapies for the millions affected by working memory impairment.",Layer-specific encoding of working memory in an automated 8-arm radial maze,10198670,F31MH124323,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Critical Thinking', 'Cues', 'Custom', 'Dementia', 'Dependence', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Enterobacteria phage P1 Cre recombinase', 'Evolution', 'Functional disorder', 'Genotype', 'Grain', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Human Activities', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Independent Living', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medial', 'Medial Dorsal Nucleus', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental Depression', 'Metabolic', 'Mind', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Opsin', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Process', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Societies', 'Supermarket', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Textiles', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'arm', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cellular imaging', 'cost', 'empowered', 'experience', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'lens', 'long term memory', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'microendoscope', 'new technology', 'novel', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'self-directed learning', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'social relationships', 'theories']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2021,46036
"Uncovering the neurophysiology of motivation in ParkinsonÃÂs disease with implanted adaptive brain stimulation TITLE: UNCOVERING THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGY OF MOTIVATION IN PARKINSON’S DISEASE WITH IMPLANTED ADAPTIVE BRAIN STIMULATION PROJECT SUMMARY Behavioral symptoms such as apathy and impulsivity represent a prevalent, highly-disabling feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and many other neurological conditions, for which treatments are currently very limited. The long-term goal of this award is to understand the neurocircuitry of motivation in order to develop precise and personalized therapies for motor and non-motor symptoms in neurological disorders. The overall objective is to establish the neural structures and signals that underpin motivation in PD. My central hypothesis is that the human motivation system comprises two functionally distinct frontal cortex - basal ganglia (FC- BG) circuits that drive behavior: 1) the prefrontal - basal ganglia circuit evaluates rewards and operates in the theta (3-7Hz) frequency range and 2) the premotor - basal ganglia circuit evaluates action costs, and is mediated by beta (13-30Hz) frequency signals, with both modulated by dopamine. Therefore, the rationale of the project is that understanding the neural structures and signals of the FC-BG reward circuit is critical for the development of effective stimulation therapies for behavioral symptoms in PD. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two Specific Aims: Aim 1) Identify the neurophysiological signatures of reward cost-benefit evaluation in PD. Patients with chronically implanted, sensing-enabled brain stimulators will perform reward cost-benefit evaluation tasks with simultaneous FC-BG recordings, on and off dopamine medication. Additionally, patients will trigger recordings of neural signals at home, with paired self-reports of apathy and impulsivity. Aim 2) Evaluate the causal relationship of frontal cortex-basal ganglia structures & signals to behavior. Spatio-temporally targeted brain stimulation will be delivered to the FC-BG network during reward cost-benefit evaluation to test the causal role of these structures and signals to motivated behavior. The research is innovative because it uses a) chronic invasive brain recordings, in patients, during behavioral tasks that index motivation, b) recordings at home to determine within-subject reproducibility and link to naturalistic motivational states and c) causal interventions to demonstrate mechanistic relationships. It is significant because determining an accurate understanding of the neurocircuitry of reward will enable the future development of precise, spatio-temporally targeted adaptive brain stimulation for apathy and impulsivity in PD, a major unmet need. As such, Dr. Little has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring group led by Prof. Philip Starr and supported by advisors Profs. Edward Chang, Wendy Mendes and Joshua Berke to develop a comprehensive structured training plan involving 1) cognitive-affective neuroscience 2) electrocorticography 3) machine learning and 4) trial design and statistics. This award will propel Dr. Little towards independence and expertise in the investigation of the neurophysiology, and treatment, of motor and non-motor neurological symptoms. It will also provide the foundation for a future R01 application investigating the relationship between clinical apathy, impulsivity and neurophysiology in a wide cohort of neurological patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE Personalized, adaptive, brain stimulation has the potential to benefit disabling behavioral symptoms such as apathy and impulsivity across a wide range of neurological conditions, including Parkinson’s disease, but is currently limited by a lack of understanding of how the brain assesses rewards to drive actions. The goal of this project is to determine how rewards are evaluated across the frontal cortex - basal ganglia circuits and to evaluate the mechanistic role of the structures and signals of this network in Parkinson’s disease. This foundational understanding will direct future stimulation therapies to reduce the burden of apathy and impulsivity in Parkinson’s disease and other neurological disorders in a precise and principled manner.",Uncovering the neurophysiology of motivation in ParkinsonÃÂs disease with implanted adaptive brain stimulation,10106490,K23NS120037,"['Address', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Award', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Craniocerebral Trauma', 'Decision Making', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electrodes', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'Future', 'Ganglia', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Huntington Disease', 'Implant', 'Impulsivity', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Motivation', 'Motor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Quality of life', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self Assessment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Work', 'addiction', 'affective neuroscience', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'experimental study', 'frontal lobe', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'motivated behavior', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'non-motor symptom', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward circuitry', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'trial design']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2021,200478
"Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior Overview - Abstract  Brainstem function is necessary for life-sustaining functions such as breathing and for survival functions, such as foraging for food. Individual motor actions are activated by specific brainstem cranial motor nuclei. The specificity of individual motor actions reflects the participation of motor nuclei in circuits within closed loops between sensors and muscle actuators. However, these loops are also nested and connect to feedback and feedforward pathways, which underlie coordination between orofacial motor actions. A key question for this proposal is how different actions are coordinated to form a rich repertoire of behaviors, such as rhythmic motions linked to breathing, and the orchestrated displacements of the head, nose, tongue, and vibrissae during exploration. We postulate that the best candidate interface for orofacial motor coordination are premotor and pre2motor neuron populations in the brainstem reticular formation: these neurons project to cranial motor nuclei, receive descending inputs from outside of the brainstem, and interconnected to each other.  Our approach exploits and expands upon a broad spectrum of innovative experimental tools. These include state-of-the-art behavioral methods to study motor actions and their coordination into behaviors. From an experimental perspective, the underlying neuronal circuitry for each orofacial motor action may be accessed via transsynaptic transport starting at the muscle activators or associated sensors in the periphery. These studies will make use of molecular, genetic, and functional labeling methods to enable cell phenotyping and circuit tracing. These data will establish the ""Components"", i.e., brainstem nuclei connectivity for all Research Projects. These studies are complemented by in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics in order measure and perturb the signal flow during exploration and decision-making: these studies will establish orofacial “Wiring Diagrams”. The sum of these techniques will permit us to elucidate the functions of intrinsic brainstem circuits and their modulation by descending pathways.  Our data will be integrated in two ways. First we will begin development of computational models of the dynamics of active sensing by the orofacial motor plant and brainstem circuits. These will initially focus on the vibrissa system, starting with characterizations of mechanics and mechano-neuronal transformations of vibrissa movement and extending to exploration of brainstem circuits that drive vibrissa set-point and rhythmic whisking. Finally, vibrissa feedforward pathways will be computationally modeled to explore how sensory input affects vibrissa dynamics. Second, to record connectivity data that arises from our experimental tracing studies, we will construct an Trainable Texture-based Digital Atlas that utilizes machine learning to automate anatomical annotation of brainstem nuclei. The Atlas is designed to allow accurate 3D alignment of labeled neurons, even when labeled neurons reside in small sub-regions outside of well-defined brainstem nuclei, based on triangulation to Atlas landmark structures. Further, digitization of serially sectioned brain data sets allows 3D reconstruction and alignment of small brainstem subregions as well as the collation of this data from different brains into the same Atlas.  Our proposed program on brainstem circuitry and dynamics will yield general lessons about the nature of neuronal computation. The analytic and anatomical tools developed for these studies will be made available through our data science core to the larger neuroscience community. Narrative Reverse engineering the brain stem circuits that govern exploratory behavior Neuronal circuits in the brainstem control life-sustaining functions, including breathing and orofacial motor actions that underlie exploration, that must be performed without interruption from the moment of birth. We will use and advance the tools of modern neuroscience to add informative labels to individual neurons in the brainstem, place these cells within circuits, connect circuits with motor actions, and coordinate different actions into behaviors. Our procedures, analysis, and modeling will mitigate many of the challenges that have limited our ability to discern the structure and function of brainstem circuits in normal and diseased states.",Reverse Engineering the Brain Stem Circuits that Govern Exploratory Behavior,10199070,U19NS107466,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Breathing', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cephalic', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Dedications', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Esthesia', 'Exploratory Behavior', 'Feedback', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Histology', 'Individual', 'Interruption', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Muscle', 'Nature', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nose', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Reticular Formation', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Sensory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tongue', 'Training', 'Vibrissae', 'active control', 'base', 'control theory', 'design', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'motor control', 'neuron component', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optogenetics', 'orofacial', 'physical model', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U19,2021,2989579
"Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease The entorhinal cortex (EC) is long known to be the region affected first in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with symptoms such as disorientation, confusion and inability to navigate appearing early in life. But more recently, a region in the brainstem- locus coeruleus (LC) was found to have tau accumulation in young healthy adults, making it the first region in the brain with AD pathology. The LC is known to be important for arousal and controls the sleep/wake switch. The neurons of LC project to several regions including EC and hippocampus which are known to be important for spatial memory. Unsurprisingly, one of the earliest symptoms of AD is spatial difficulties and it is possible that early pathology in LC affects sleep leading to spatial memory deficits. With both LC and EC important for memory, we aim to identify which of them is more vulnerable to tau and Aβ pathology. To explore this possibility, we will first inject LC and EC regions of wildtype mouse with pathological tau derived from human AD brains to make them dysfunctional, and evaluate their neuronal function. We will also assess sleep and test memory performance in relevant behavior tasks. To understand how aβ affects tau pathology, we will inject human tau in the APP Knock-In mice which has physiological amounts of APP expressed in them. We will determine if Aβ together with tau worsens the neuronal function of LC and EC neurons and it sleep and memory is impaired further. We will use multi-region silicon probes to simultaneously record activity from LC or medial EC and hippocampal neurons. The MEC and hippocampal neurons are well characterized with properties that can be easily measured using spatial navigation tasks. We will make use of virtual reality head-fixed setup for the animals to navigate in, and allowing us to quickly test animal’s memory in any context and environment. The animals will be tested for object-location memory and context-dependent memory in virtual environment. We will use machine learning algorithms to decode animal’s position in the LC, MEC and HPC neural data and determine if it is affected by tau or Aβ or both. We will also assess sleep parameters and correlate with memory. We hypothesize that tau in LC and EC will make its neurons dysfunctional and directly affect sleep and memory, and this in concert with Aβ will exacerbate neuronal dysfunction leading to increased sleep problems and spatial memory impairment as seen in early AD. With this we aim to identify electrophysiological biomarker of neuronal dysfunction before the onset of behavioral troubles. We will test if increasing the neuronal firing in hypoactive neurons and reducing the firing in hyperactive neurons will restore downstream neuronal dysfunction and reverse sleep problems and cognitive impairment. The proposal brings together diverse fields (neuroscience, pathology and computational neuroscience) applying large-scale recording techniques simultaneously across multiple brain regions to develop analytical and predictive tests to interrogate function in vulnerable brain regions that are dysfunctional in AD. The locus coeruleus and the entorhinal cortex region of the brain are among the first to be affected in Alzheimer’s disease, causing sleep problems and cognitive dysfunction. Using multi-region recording probes we will evaluate their function to determine which one of them is more vulnerable to tau and aβ pathology. We will test if by using optogenetic approach the neurons in these regions can be rescued and cognitive deficits be reversed.",Electrophysiological Evaluation of Brain Regions Vulnerable to Alzheimers Disease,10142333,R01AG064066,"['20 year old', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Confusion', 'Data', 'Disorientation', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Head', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Knock-in', 'Knock-in Mouse', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Location', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mus', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Quick Test for Liver Function', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Silicon', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep Stages', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Symptoms', 'Tauopathies', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'Work', 'behavior measurement', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive testing', 'computational neuroscience', 'entorhinal cortex', 'locus ceruleus structure', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mouse model', 'neuron loss', 'non rapid eye movement', 'optogenetics', 'predictive test', 'rapid eye movement', 'relating to nervous system', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep regulation', 'spatial memory', 'targeted treatment', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation', 'tool', 'virtual environment', 'virtual reality', 'virtual reality environment', 'way finding']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,622966
"Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology approach. Project Summary Males and females elicit aggressive behavior for resources and survival. Male aggression has been well studied in many species. However, not much is known about female aggression. Recently, my work identified a small female- specific subgroup of cells in the pC1 brain region (pC1α neurons), that triggered females to fight at extremely high intensity levels when activated. For the K99 phase, I will build on my previous work and elaborate on the pC1α neurons circuitry under the mentorship of Dr. E. Kravitz, a well-renowned expert in aggression and Drosophila genetics. Aim 1 is concerned with determining the pre- and post-synaptic partners of the pC1α neurons. For this aim, I will work with my co-mentor, Dr. R. Wilson, to determine pre- and post- synaptic partners and design transgenic fly lines to target these areas. Based on my preliminary data of electron microscopy tracings, I hypothesize that, a)SAG neurons provide inputs to pC1α neurons; and b) pC1α neurons project dendritic outputs to PVL04om_pct neurons in areas previously identified in aggression such as Posterior Lateral Protocerebrum. I anticipate that both up- and down-stream pC1α neurons partners will induce high intensity female aggression. Aim 2 will investigate the role of candidate aggression-associated genes in pC1α neurons. I will train in single-cell profiling methods (used by the Kravitz lab) and address the hypothesis that genes overexpressed in male aggression mediating neurons also play key role in pC1α neuron function. In collaboration with co-mentor Dr. B de Bivort, I will also use neural network-based body part tracking software to train a classifier to automatically label aggressive behaviors. This will allow me to use machine-learning algorithms to capture multi-dimensional representations of the phenotypic differences among fly lines with mutations and transgenic effectors that target aggression circuits (e.g, activating and inhibiting a neuron or overexpressing aggregating proteins). The trainings acquired in my mentored K99 phase will facilitate my transition to independent research studying age-related diseases and behavior. Severe behavioral disturbances of aggression and agitation have been reported to be increasingly common during the progression of Alzheimer's disease and other related dementias.The reasons for this are completely unknown. Moreover, there is a dearth of understanding of how changes in neurons, during neurodegeneration, lead to specific behavioral defects. For the R00 phase, I will shift my focus to looking at aggression in neurodegenerative disease models and begin my efforts by elucidating the contribution of neuronal protein aggregates of Aβ-42 to aggression. My preliminary data indicates that overexpression of human Aβ-42 in using a (pan-neuronal driver) in males and (cholinergic driver) in females induces heightend levels of aggression. Based on these findings, I hypothesize Aβ-42 overexpression induced aggression is due to altered excitability of key aggression promoting neurons. I plan to use diverse and integrative systems approaches (learned from my mentored phase). I will lead a multi-pronged research effort to understand the mechanisms by which neurons regulate their normal function in the presence of an aging and or neurodegenerative disease state and how these changes affect circuit pathways and ultimately aggression. Project Narrative Aggression accompanies a number of common human neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Alzheimer's and other related dementias), with little understanding of how cognitive and aggression symptoms may be linked at the neuronal level. Aggression has been extensively studied in males of many species, but neglected in females (likewise, the interaction of sex and age is neglected). The objective of this research program is to identify the neural circuitry that governs female aggression (K99- mentored phase) and later transition (R00- independent phase) into discovering mechanisms of dementia-related pathology and how these changes affect aggression.",Unraveling the neural basis of female aggression and dementia-related aggression: a systems biology approach.,10192224,K99GM141449,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Aging', 'Agitation', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Body part', 'Brain region', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cells', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Female', 'Ganglia', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Human', 'Instinct', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Mammals', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nervous system structure', 'Network-based', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'PC3 cell line', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical aggression', 'Play', 'Population', 'RNA Interference', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Senile Plaques', 'Social Behavior', 'Stream', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Transgenes', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Work', 'age related', 'base', 'behavior change', 'behavior test', 'bullying', 'cholinergic', 'cholinergic neuron', 'common symptom', 'connectome', 'design', 'extracellular', 'fighting', 'fly', 'genetic manipulation', 'instrumentation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'neglect', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuronal excitability', 'novel', 'overexpression', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protein aggregation', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'sex', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'skills', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,K99,2021,100000
"Mapping the neural circuitry underlying walking Project Summary Walking is an essential and conserved behavior across the animal kingdom. The ability to move in a coordinated, robust yet flexible manner is a crucial for an animal’s survival in the ever changing environment. Motor behaviors are controlled by sensory neuropils in the brain which talk to motor centers such as the ventral nerve cord (VNC) in the thorax to execute precise motor outputs. Descending neurons are the primary conduits of information that accomplish this connection between the brain and the VNC. However the downstream target neurons and complex circuits that precisely govern the execution of a specific kind of limbed motor output such as running, turning, slowing down, switching gait, climbing, stepping etc remain individually undefined. This project aims to map these individual circuits that control different walking kinematics. In aim 1, we will map the post-synaptic targets of descending neurons using a translabeling technique called Trans Tango. We already know from previous studies that have characterized the morphology of all the descending neurons in Drosophila, which DNs target the leg neuropils in the ventral nerve chord. These descending neurons are very likely to be directly implicated in controlling walking behavior. Additionally, we also have broad behavioral information for a subset of the DNs. Using this existing morphological and behavioral data, we can start to map out the motor and premotor circuits that are downstream of these DNs and reveal the distinct circuit components that control specific walking kinematics. Some of the DNs we plan to screen, affect similar behaviors hence it will be interesting to reveal whether they converge onto similar or different targets. In the second aim, we aim to use a computational approach search for generation Gal4 lines whose neuronal expression patterns match the downstream target neurons we want to study. Existing split Gal4 lines will be identified or new ones will be generated in order to gain genetic access to the downstream circuit neurons of interest. In the third aim, we will use three behavior setups: Flywalker, the Arena and the fly-on-ball setup to study a range of walking parameters in high resolution using optogenetics intersectional strategies. We will use optogenetic activation, silencing and also epistasis experiments to map out which components of the circuit are sufficient or necessary for a particular walking kinematic. Project Narrative An animal’s ability to walk in a regulated manner is controlled by the brain through coordinated neural circuitry. Descending neurons are the bridges connecting the brain to the motor centers in thorax that then controls limbed coordination and movement but the exact circuitry downstream of descending neurons responsible for walking remain undefined.

"Investigating Ventral CA1 Neural Representations of Anxiety-Like Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY The ability to detect and appropriately respond to potentially threatening situations is critical for survival. Dysregulation of the neural systems which mediate these functions can lead to pathological avoidance of ordinary environments and persistent feelings of imminent threat, key components of the negative emotional state characteristic of anxiety disorders. Many studies have begun to reveal the brain regions and neural circuits that control avoidance behavior and encode states of anxiety. Specifically, the ventral hippocampus has emerged as a critical node for emotional behaviors including those evoked by anxiogenic environments. Our lab and others have found that subpopulations of single neurons in ventral CA1 are activated by aversive environments, but this selectivity does not generalize across different tasks used to assay anxiety-like behavior. Moreover, it is unclear which inputs to the ventral hippocampus provide the emotional information that drives this anxiety-related neural activity. The mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety states is still unknown and investigating how this brain region represents these emotional states is an essential step towards understanding the neural substrates of anxiety disorders. In this proposal, I will utilize pose estimation algorithms and unsupervised behavioral segmentation (Aim 1), in vivo calcium imaging and neural population analyses (Aim 2), along with simultaneous input-specific optogenetic inhibition and calcium imaging (Aim 3) to characterize the behavioral manifestations of anxiety-like emotional states and determine how they are encoded in the ventral hippocampus. Successful completion of this study will help to elucidate the role of the ventral hippocampus in anxiety, potentially opening new research avenues for the development of neural circuit based therapeutics to treat anxiety disorders. These data along with the research and scientific expertise developed through this Kirschstein-NRSA F30 Fellowship Award will support my long-term goal of becoming an independent physician-scientist. PROJECT NARRATIVE Anxiety is characterized by a persistent and disruptive negative emotional state. This proposal will utilize pose estimation algorithms, unsupervised behavioral segmentation, neural population analyses, and simultaneous in vivo calcium imaging and input-specific optogenetic inhibition to investigate the mechanism by which the ventral hippocampus encodes anxiety-like emotional states.

"Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution Project Summary The dynamic adaptability of the mammalian brain to environmental changes is remarkable, as it is the complexity of the networks of neurons underlying the operations that allow for such adaptations. Although we have some understanding of the anatomical and functional basis of this, we are still lacking a detailed picture of how the modulation of neuronal activity works. What is the timing and locations of these neuromodulator release and relationship with excitatory/inhibitory circuits? How does the neuromodulators circuitry accomplish the regulation of firing and synaptic properties of targeted neurons? Filling these gaps in knowledge would advance our understanding of all aspects of neuromodulator biology and allow discovery of new therapeutic strategies. To help close this gap, we have used creative approaches to the development of genetically encoded to directly report behaviorally triggered and modulated neuromodulator release including serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE). We have disseminated these indicators to the neuroscience community and spurred major discoveries of novel mechanisms regulating neuromodulator release underlying motivation and addiction. Build on this initial success, we propose to further expand the effectiveness of this toolbox of NM sensors to enable imaging sparse release at depth and subcellular resolution. Our specific goals are to (1) improve the sensitivity of our current sensors to enable robust imaging of sparse neuromodulator release, push their spatial resolution to the subcellular level and increase linearity of response at lower concentrations; (2) expand their spectral range to red/far-red to enhance imaging depth, SNR and in vivo multiplex measurement and manipulation of multiple circuit components using two or three distinct colors, and (3) characterize the possible interference of current sensors with endogenous signaling and systematically validate emerging sensors with a wide-ranging microscopy approaches in vivo. Our strategy relies on a dynamic collaboration between the sensor design team and end users to obtain continuous feedback to implement efficient improvements to the sensors. It is our goal to rapidly disseminate a wide range of well-characterized, highly sensitive indicators for the neuroscience community to be employed to study behaving mice, fish, flies and worms, to enrich our knowledge on the functional roles of neuromodulators in the brain circuitry. Altered neurotransmitter and neuromodulator (NM) signaling is a key feature of virtually all human neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, depression, and addiction. We will engineer, validate and disseminate optimized genetically encoded sensors for visualizing neuronal communication with enhanced depth and resolution using advanced microscopy techniques. Combined with optogenetics and calcium/voltage imaging, applications of these tools will reveal the full richness of neuromodulatory signaling to greatly extend, and potentially transform, our understanding of how neurochemical inputs influence cell and circuit function in health and disease.",Multiplex interrogation of neuromodulatory signaling in behaving animals with enhanced depth and resolution,10166304,U01NS120820,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Behavioral', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Development', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Effectiveness', 'Endorphins', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Fishes', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Knowledge', 'Ligand Binding', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Penetration', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photometry', 'Photons', 'Property', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serotonin', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'cell type', 'design', 'environmental change', 'extracellular', 'fly', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'minimally invasive', 'monoamine', 'multiplexed imaging', 'nerve supply', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'operation', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'sensor', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'two-photon', 'virtual', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,U01,2021,869559
"CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations Throughout the brain, specialized systems carry out different but complementary functions, sometimes  independently but often in cooperation. However, we do not understand how their activity is dynamically  coordinated, and dysregulation of this is associated with many mental health conditions. Neuronal oscillations, which are detectable in local field potentials (LFPs) at various frequencies, are a promising  target for this coordination. Gamma oscillations (40-100 Hz) in particular have been singled out since they enhance stimulus responses, facilitate interactions between brain regions, and are expressed ubiquitously across cortical and subcortical regions. Indeed, gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral  nucleus of the amygdala (BL), an important regulator of emotional behaviors. BL gamma oscillations are  enhanced during periods of heightened vigilance during a foraging task, following emotionally salient experiences, and upon presentation of socially-relevant stimuli. The variety of circumstances that engage  it make it a promising target for interventions affecting emotional behaviors in general. However, technical challenges abound because gamma manifests as brief intermittent oscillatory bursts, layered atop numerous ongoing activities in other frequency bands. This precludes manipulating gamma exclusively with traditional pharmacological, optogenetic, or chemogenetic approaches, since these have substantial  effects on ongoing non-gamma activities, and are delivered irrespective of whether gamma bursts are present or absent. To overcome this, a closed-loop algorithm was developed that monitors the LFP in  real-time for gamma oscillations and delivers precisely timed optogenetic stimulation capable of enhancing or suppressing gamma strength on a cycle-by-cycle basis. While this improves upon the status  quo,, further refinement is needed. Aim 1 of this proposal seeks to clarify how the gamma modulation technique operates via biophysically detailed modeling of the local circuits in the BL that generate gamma, the effects of optogenetic stimulation, and the closed-loop algorithm. Aim 2 designs better signal  processing routines for detecting and parameterizing gamma in real-time. Aim 3 develops an approach to  create customized biophysical models that reproduce the properties of gamma observed in individual  subjects, which when combined with the results of Aims 1 and 2 should allow for optimized control over gamma oscillations in individual subjects. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Gamma oscillations occur in the basolateral amygdala, a brain region implicated in emotional regulation.  By developing improved methods to manipulate these oscillations, we hope to better understand their  function and improve our ability to control emotional states and behaviors. n/a",CRCNS: Optimization of closed-loop control of gamma oscillations,10207403,R01MH122023,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Custom', 'Detection', 'Emotional', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Property', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rodent Model', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'biophysical model', 'cognitive function', 'design', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional behavior', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'signal processing', 'social', 'vigilance']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2021,284005
"The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay Project Summary The hippocampus is a critical site for rapid memory formation and retrieval, with extensively documented functions representing spatial and navigational variables, yet less is known of the means by which it guides behavior. Bursts of hippocampal activity identified in many species as sharp-wave ripple (SWR) events are promising neural mechanisms to link hippocampal activity and behavioral function, since during SWRs hippocampus can represent positions the animal previously experienced, or will traverse in the near future. This proposal considers the food-caching behaviors of chickadees, who use a hippocampal-dependent, one- shot memory to guide cache retrieval. This behavior is exceptionally promising to link hippocampal activity to individual experiences, which has been a barrier to determining the nature of representations during SWR and their function in previous studies. These studies will develop a comprehensive account of how chickadee behavior is affected by cache site memory, determine whether SWRs are related to memory-specific components of caching behavior, and determine whether SWRs represent individual cache sites to assist later retrieval. I hypothesize that memory-guided behavior is distinguishable from random foraging. I will use video tracking to measure the behavioral microstructure of chickadee caching behavior, including postural and gaze time series, and develop quantitative models of behavioral motifs and their temporal structure. Using these tools to compare memory-guided and random foraging behaviors, I will develop decoders that indicate precisely how and when behavior appears memory-guided. I hypothesize that SWRs occur more often, and are more predictive of behavior, when behavior is memory- guided. I will use electrophysiology in freely moving chickadees during caching to relate SWRs to the microstructural analysis of behavior and decoding of behavioral strategy. I hypothesize that SWRs reactivate representations of previous, individual caching events, and that this reactivation improves subsequent retrieval for that individual site. Using electrophysiological recordings in caching birds, I will relate reactivations to the accuracy of retrieval behavior. Using online SWR detection and suppression, I will further determine if SWRs causally affect later retrieval behavior. Project Narrative Food caching birds are a unique model system for dissecting the fundamental principles of hippocampal function. Thorough characterization and computational modeling of this behavior, and the specific contribution of hippocampal memory, will allow insight into the neural mechanisms by which hippocampal representations guide behavior. We expect the principles resulting from this study to illuminate dysfunctions of memory present in many neurological disorders.",The behavioral microstructure of a memory-guided food-caching behavior and its relationship to hippocampal replay,10162319,F32MH123015,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological Models', 'Birds', 'Cells', 'Cognition', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Episodic memory', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Food', 'Future', 'Grain', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Location', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Posture', 'Process', 'Retrieval', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Route', 'Series', 'Site', 'Space Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'gaze', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'memory consolidation', 'memory retrieval', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuromechanism', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'tool', 'way finding']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2021,71390
"Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches Project Summary/Abstract Juveniles acquire crucial skills by imitating skilled adults, as when infants imitate their parents' speech sounds. Evidence suggests that cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry critically supports this process both in general and specifically when juvenile zebra finches learn to imitate an adult tutor, an experimentally tractable phenomenon. A cortical pathway in juvenile zebra finches can generate stereotyped song that becomes more similar to tutor song over the course of learning. A song-dedicated CBG circuit influences activity in this pathway, acutely increasing the variability of song acoustics from rendition to rendition. My preliminary data suggest that the CBG circuit also acutely induces a directional shift in song acoustics, compared to song generated by the cortical pathway without CBG influence. The proposed experiments test the idea that the CBG drives rapid acoustic shifts, directed at the imitation target, that slowly consolidate in downstream motor cortical structures. To test this hypothesis, I have developed a (1) novel song analysis and (2) a novel longitudinal experimental design that uses (3) innovative optogentic techniques in this model system. These experiments have the potential to significantly advance our understanding of CBG support for zebra finch song learning, and to test CBG reinforcement learning models in a learning domain that does not require external reinforcement. Project Narrative Early in life, we must acquire crucial skills like speech by imitating adults, so neurological impairments of imitative learning can be debilitating. This proposal is relevant to human health because it will address how cortico-basal ganglia (CBG) circuitry supports juvenile imitative learning in a powerful laboratory model, song learning by zebra finches. Insight from the project's findings may improve our ability to relate CBG circuit biology to behavioral outcomes in normal and disordered juvenile imitative learning.",Testing a model of cortico-basal ganglia support for juvenile imitative learning in zebra finches,10093973,F31HD098772,"['Acoustics', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Birds', 'Child', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Failure', 'Future', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Motor Pathways', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Opsin', 'Output', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Punishment', 'Pupil', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speech', 'Speech Sound', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Viral Vector', 'Work', 'autoencoder', 'behavioral outcome', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'motor learning', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'role model', 'skills', 'stem', 'tool', 'tutoring', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector', 'vocal learning', 'vocalization', 'zebra finch']",NICHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,38255
"Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks The mammalian brain is believed to be optimally designed for robust and adaptable computation of the sensory inputs from the world, with respect to both its hardware (network structure) and software (network dynamics). The precise connections between the intricate structural connectivity and the rich network dynamics, however, are yet unknown. Moreover, our understanding of how the network structure and dynamics shape (or are shaped by) underlying coding principles in the brain network, is limited. My research plan proposes to close this gap by leveraging rich dataset obtained by state-of-art experimental techniques at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and innovative mathematical methods.  Specifically, my project aims to 1) link network structure and dynamic information processing in the brain, and to 2) bridge the gap between detailed biophysiological mechanisms and overarching neural coding principles with a focus on predictive coding theory, using data-driven mathematical models. To address Aim 1, I will investigate how network dynamics measured by synchronizability, metastability, and integrated information depend on local and global structure of the network. I will then study whether the experimentally obtained mouse brain connectome has optimal connectivity structures for unique dynamical characteristics. These analyses will be extended to the cell-type and layer-specific brain connectivity, based on the latest Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity data obtained from Cre-transgenic mice. During the independent phase, I will investigate whether brain-like networks can be evolved from optimization of dynamic measures. Regarding Aim 2, I will analyze data obtained from my current collaborative project which experimentally tests predictive coding models in the mouse visual cortex. In this study, we measure neural activity in response to expected and unexpected sequences of natural stimuli across three hierarchically related areas. Upon completion of the experiments, during the mentored phase, I will investigate mapping of algorithmic units in predictive coding models to neuronal populations in different layers. During my independent career period, I will extend the predictive coding model to incorporate active sensing and thalamo-cortical circuitries.  The project during the mentored phase will be carried out at the University of Washington which provides a highly interdisciplinary environment and offers the ideal training for me to become an independent researcher. I will also have access to rich resources and outstanding collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. I will have two mentors, one from the University of Washington and another from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. This unique setup will allow me to study mathematical models based on experimental data obtained by cutting-edge techniques with guidance from mentors with strong theoretical backgrounds. With theories closely tied to experiments, I believe my proposed project will contribute to our understanding of the connection between structure and computation of the neuronal network, addressing BRAIN initiative’s high priorities. The proposed research aims to probe how adaptable sensory coding arises from intricate connectivity structure and dynamics of the brain network at multiple scales. This study will contribute to our understanding of connections between unique structure and dynamics of the brain network as well as the mapping of complex neuronal dynamics in the cortical circuitry to algorithmic nodes in predictive coding models. By combining cutting-edge experimental and theoretical tools, this project will contribute to identifying fundamental principles underlying emergence of cognition and perception from neuronal network dynamics.","Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks",10311650,R00EY030840,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive control', 'collaborative environment', 'connectome', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'object recognition', 'predictive test', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'theories', 'tool']",NEI,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R00,2021,245158
"Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning Learning is how organisms adapt to changes in their environment and involves the coordination of neural systems mediating cognition, emotion, and motor control. The major goal of the proposed research program is to elucidate the neural circuit mechanisms underlying interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems during associative learning. Interactions between these neural systems are particularly important because the context and emotional significance of stimuli provide essential information for acquisition and performance of motor responses. The breakdown of interactions between cognitive, emotional, and motor systems in various neurological disorders can therefore have devastating consequences for learned behaviors. The prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and cerebellum play significant roles in cognition, emotional responses, and motor learning, respectively. The proposed research program constitutes a comprehensive analysis of cerebellar interactions with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex during associative motor learning. Our general conceptual framework is that the cerebellum receives inputs from the amygdala and prefrontal cortex via the pons regarding which stimuli are important and when they occur, and the cerebellum then sends error-driven feedback to these forebrain systems to facilitate learning about important events. This conceptual framework takes into account the bidirectional relationship between the cerebellum and the relevant forebrain systems as well as interactions between forebrain systems. Multi-site electrophysiology, pathway-specific optogenetics, and precise behavioral analyses will be combined to investigate circuit-level interactions between the cerebellum, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex during associative learning and extinction (inhibitory learning) training. The proposed studies would significantly advance understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying cerebellar interactions with the forebrain. This would be a substantial contribution to the field because it has been known that the cerebellum must interact with the forebrain in many contexts that are crucial for everyday life such as learning, memory, planning, control of emotions, and communication, but very little is known mechanistically about how the cerebellum interacts with the amygdala and prefrontal cortex. Memory deficits are found with many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and following stroke; the breakdown of interactions between memory systems can be particularly debilitating. This proposal examines the neural mechanisms underlying interactions between emotional and motor memory systems during associative learning. Elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying memory system interactions is potentially important for developing treatments for memory deficits.",Cerebellar Interactions with the Amygdala and Prefrontal Cortex during Learning,10069403,R01NS088567,"['Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Blinking', 'Cerebellum', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Conditioned Stimulus', 'Data', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Organism', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pontine structure', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Prosencephalon', 'Rattus', 'Research', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioned fear', 'granule cell', 'indexing', 'learned behavior', 'learning extinction', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor learning', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'two-photon']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,379571
"Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum Heightened levels of social aggression, a motivated behavior, are often associated with neuropsychiatric disease. Although our understanding of the neural mechanisms regulating aggression is incomplete, both lateral septum (LS) and ventral hypothalamus are known to be important. Even though LS receives one of its strongest inputs from hippocampus, a region important for declarative memory, little is known about how hippocampus regulates aggression. Moreover, as hippocampus is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders associated with altered social behavior and aggression, a basic understanding of how hippocampus and its circuitry regulate aggression will likely yield important new insights into disease mechanisms.  Here we focus on the role of the hippocampal CA2 region in social aggression. Relatively little is known about CA2, largely because of technical problems that limit its study with conventional lesioning approaches. We therefore developed a Cre mouse line that enables us to label and manipulate the activity of CA2 pyramidal neurons. Using a genetic silencing approach, we found that CA2 was critical during non-aggressive social exploration for the formation of social memory, the ability of an animal to recognize and remember another mouse (conspecific), but CA2 was not needed for other forms of hippocampal memory. Our recent results now show that CA2 also promotes social aggression, through an excitatory projection to LS that disinhibits a subnucleus in ventral medial hypothalamus important for aggression. Moreover, we find that the social neuropeptide arginine vasopressin promotes aggression by enhancing the CA2 to LS synapse.  Here we ask: How does a single brain region, CA2, participate in social memory storage during non- aggressive social exploration and promote social aggression? Is there a single population of CA2 neurons that is activated during both social exploration and social aggression? Or are there specialist neurons for each behavior? Does CA2 actively encode distinct representations of social exploration and social aggression, or does CA2 encode a single social salience signal that does not in itself encode aggression but that is gated by the internal state of an animal to promote aggression through CA2 inputs to LS? We will test the hypothesis that vasopressin release in LS acts as such a permissive gate. As vasopressin also enhances social memory by acting within CA2, we will ask: How can a single neuromodulator produce two such distinct actions? Do distinct sources of vasopressin input to CA2 and LS promote, respectively, social memory and aggression?  We will address these questions by characterizing CA2 circuits and neural activity during aggressive and non-aggressive social interactions using: 1. Activity-dependent genetic marking of active CA2 ensembles; 2. Electrophysiological characterization of CA2?LS circuits and their regulation by vasopressin in ex vivo brain slices; 3. Behavioral control of aggression using chemogenetics and optogenetics; and 4. In vivo optical and electrophysiological recordings of CA2 activity during non-aggressive and aggressive social interactions. Many neuropsychiatric disorders are associated with increased levels of aggression, which impair patient care and place a burden on society. Here we will examine the neural mechanisms by which the CA2 region of the hippocampus, a relatively unexplored brain region implicated in social memory and schizophrenia, regulates aggressive behavior in mice.",Regulation of social aggression through hippocampal CA2 inputs to lateral septum,10226105,R01MH120292,"['Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Argipressin', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Genetic', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Impairment', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Lesion', 'Locales', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Middle Hypothalamus', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Patient Care', 'Play', 'Population', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Interaction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specialist', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Vasopressins', 'anatomical tracing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'maternal aggression', 'motivated behavior', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'presynaptic', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'selective expression', 'social', 'tool']",NIMH,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2021,462162
"The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction Project Summary/Abstract Memory may be defined as the retention over time of internal representations gained through experience, and the capacity to reconstruct these representations at later times (Dudai 2007). These internal representations are thought to be encoded by long-lasting physical brain changes (memory traces or `engrams') (Josselyn, Kohler & Frankland 2015, 2017; Tonegawa et al. 2015; Schacter 2001). Remembering fear-evoking events is adaptive; it helps one make future choices based on past experience. It may even be beneficial to generalize some fearful memories. However, excessive fear generalization or treating no-longer threatening stimuli as dangerous may be maladaptive. Indeed, recurrent or inappropriately expressed fearful memories are a major component of several psychiatric diseases, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety. Therefore, understanding how memory traces for fearful events are formed, change over time, under what conditions they remain specific or generalize, and how they are impacted by behavioral extinction are critical questions to not only understanding how the brain uses information but also for informing the development of new treatment/prevention strategies for disorders characterized by inappropriate fear memories. Here two PIs (Drs. Josselyn and Frankland), both New Investigators, will combine their expertise to address these important questions. Because all techniques are associated with caveats and limitations, we will use a variety of techniques including optogenetic manipulation, brain-wide neuronal activity mapping and the use of graph-theory to produce “engram maps” and real time in vivo calcium imaging combined with behavior. Together, the ability to manipulate and observe an engram as it forms, changes over time and with behavioral extinction is innovative and may lead to a shift in the very definition of an engram, as well as increase our understanding for developing treatments aimed at resolving inappropriate fear memories. Project Narrative More effective treatment approaches for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety disorders will be facilitated by better understanding how the brain forms memory traces supporting fear memories, how these change over time and with extinction.","The Role of Neuronal Ensembles Supporting Auditory Fear Conditioning (Engrams) in the Amygdala in Memory Formation, Generalization and Extinction",10087966,R01MH119421,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Architecture', 'Auditory', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Endoscopes', 'Event', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Freezing', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Halorhodopsins', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Immediate-Early Genes', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Opsin', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Recurrence', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Virus', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'base', 'conditioned fear', 'data analysis pipeline', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'fear memory', 'graph theory', 'in vivo calcium imaging', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory consolidation', 'neuronal excitability', 'optogenetics', 'promoter', 'recruit', 'therapy development', 'treatment strategy']",NIMH,HOSPITAL FOR SICK CHLDRN (TORONTO),R01,2021,337780
"Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. However, the fundamental mechanisms that allow animals to initiate, maintain and terminate these states are unknown. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are critical for the generation of behavioral states, but a mechanistic understanding of how neuromodulators act on circuits to generate stable circuit-wide patterns of neural activity has been lacking, largely due to the complexity of neuromodulation in mammalian circuits. We have chosen to tackle this problem using C. elegans, a nematode whose nervous system consists of 302 neurons with a fully defined wiring diagram. We previously characterized C. elegans movement patterns and showed that feeding animals transition between two stable arousal states, roaming and dwelling. We characterized the neural circuit that generates roaming and dwelling states, and found that two opposing neuromodulators, serotonin and the neuropeptide PDF, act on a defined neural circuit to generate this bi-stable behavior: serotonin action on the circuit stabilizes dwelling states, while PDF stabilizes roaming states. Now that we have defined a neuromodulatory circuit that generates persistent behavioral states, we are poised to resolve several fundamental questions about neural circuit function and organization. Here, we propose to dissect mechanisms of neural circuit persistence by examining how specific neuromodulators reconfigure neural circuits to stabilize circuit-wide activity patterns that give rise to long-lasting behavioral states. Resolving this question requires whole-circuit measurements of neural activity as animals freely transition between states. Thus, we have already developed a new imaging technology that allows us to simultaneously monitor the activity of every neuron in a circuit in freely-moving C. elegans animals. By combining this imaging technology with genetic/optogenetic manipulations and new analysis/modeling methods, we will illustrate a new multi-disciplinary approach that can be used to dissect the mechanisms by which collective neural dynamics arise in a circuit. First, we will first identify the circuit-wide patterns of activity that define different behavioral states (Aim 1). Second, we will perturb this system to examine how neuromodulators act on specific neurons in the circuit to generate these stable circuit-wide patterns of activity (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine how activity in this neuromodulatory circuit is altered by changes in the environment and, after simultaneously recording the sensory neurons that feed into this circuit, we will develop a network model that describes how noisy sensory inputs are transformed into a bi-stable behavioral state output (Aim 3). These studies will provide new mechanistic insights into how neuromodulators orchestrate whole-circuit changes in activity to influence behavior. By providing quantitative links between specific sites of neuromodulation, whole-circuit dynamics, and emergent behaviors, these studies will yield a generalizable model for circuit function that will bear on studies of sleep/wake states, emotional states, and cognitive states. Many animal behaviors are organized into long-lasting states, perhaps most strikingly in the sleep/wake and emotional states that mammals display. Biogenic amine and neuropeptide neuromodulators are thought to be critical for behavioral state generation, but the mechanisms by which neuromodulators coordinate the activity of their target neurons to organize circuit- or brain-wide patterns of activity over long stretches of time remain unknown. Here, we will use a new model for behavioral state generation in the nematode C. elegans to determine how neuromodulators act at specific sites in a neural circuit to give rise to whole-circuit patterns of activity that underlie persistent behavioral states.",Neuromodulatory control of collective circuit dynamics in C. elegans,10207798,R01NS104892,"['Action Potentials', 'Afferent Neurons', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Feed', 'Animals', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biogenic Amines', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Drosophila genus', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Food', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Global Change', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Invertebrates', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'Nematoda', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neuromodulator', 'Neurons', 'Neuropeptides', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Neurosciences', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Sensory', 'Serotonin', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Transmission', 'System', 'Systems Theory', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ursidae Family', 'Work', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral study', 'connectome', 'density', 'dynamic system', 'food environment', 'insight', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'millisecond', 'mutant', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural patterning', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'new technology', 'optogenetics', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory input', 'squid axon', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,386750
"Deciphering principles of network dynamics underlying depression symptom severity from multi-day intracranial recordings in patients with major depression PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common and causes significant disability world-wide. While typically responsive to medications and therapy, there remain a subset of patients who are treatment resistant. Novel approaches are critical to treat these patients. MDD is likely caused by dysfunction in distributed neural networks, a perspective consistent with the etiological and diagnostic heterogeneity of this disorder. While imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) have helped identify MDD circuitry, no consensus has been reached on the identification of diagnostic biomarkers. Furthermore, the dynamics of MDD circuitry in relation to symptom severity is unknown. Characterization of circuit signatures that define MDD symptom severity states and the extent to which these circuits are modifiable using electrical stimulation are critical for therapeutic advancement.  Intracranial EEG (iEEG) offers a high spatial and temporal resolution method to study depression networks. For the first time, we have an unparalleled opportunity to study such circuits in MDD patients participating in a clinical trial of personalized responsive neurostimulation for treatment resistant depression (PRESIDIO). In stage 1 of this trial, participants are implanted with 160 electrodes from 10 sub-chronic intracranial leads across 10 brain sites for 10 days. The goal of this parent study stage is to optimize brain-site targeting for deep brain stimulation. In this proposal, we will leverage the opportunity to study MDD circuit principles from cortical and deep brain structures over a multi-day time period.  In an ancillary study to this parent clinical trial, we propose a set of experiments that establish basic principles of network dynamics underlying MDD from direct neural recordings. This proposal is organized around the principal concept that brain circuit dysfunction is reflected in abnormal signatures of functional connectivity and rhythmic local-field activity. This concept is supported by our pilot work where we found evidence of distinct MDD networks characterized by functional connectivity and spectral activity. Furthermore, in the first parent trial participant we successfully mapped MDD circuits at the individual level and found that gamma power in the amygdala could successfully decode mood state (AUC = 86%). This proposal builds on these preliminary findings in two aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize state-dependent functional connectivity and spectral activity in relation to symptom severity. In Aim 2, we will examine the manner and time course in which targeted electrical stimulation acutely modifies circuits. Together, this research will yield the first characterization of connectivity and activity dynamics in MDD over a multi-day period from direct neural recordings. This rare insight into MDD circuity provided by this novel dataset establishes proof-of-concept principles for biomarker development and therapeutic target selection that could critically advance personalized MDD treatments. PROJECT NARRATIVE The characterization of circuit dynamics underlying mood states in major depression and the acute modifiability of circuit features is an innovative and poorly understood area of research. Using an unparalleled dataset of invasive multi-day neural recordings from 160 contacts in patients with major depression who are taking part in a clinical trial of closed loop deep brain stimulation (PRESDIO trial), we seek to identify a set of neural connectivity and activity features that characterize symptom severity states, and to determine whether circuit features can be acutely modified by brain stimulation.

Accordingly, we have developed a novel paradigm for visualizing synaptic changes that occur during classical conditioning in larval zebrafish. Using this paradigm we have observed striking region-specific changes in the distributions of synapses that drive the rewiring of neural circuits that mediate threat responses. In this grant we will expand this paradigm by monitoring neuronal activity through imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicators throughout the pallium (the homolog of the amygdala) before, during and after classical conditioning and extinction. This will allow us to identify cells that comprise the circuits that control threat and safety and explore their connectivity using optogenetics. We will investigate how different sensory inputs can cause changes in the activity of those cells leading to synapse change, and the formation or extinction of associative memories. A crucial component of these studies will be the recording of field potentials to capture rhythmic activity throughout the pallium and high speed SPIM imaging of genetically encoded voltage indicators to record rhythms in individual cells. By understanding the precise timing of signals that impinge on individual cells we will uncover mechanisms that underlie synaptic plasticity. Our goal is to develop a theoretical model describing the neural circuits that underlie threat detection and how they can change as a result of associative memory formation and extinction. The research proposed in this grant is aimed at characterizing essential circuits in the larval zebrafish that control threat and safety. We will leverage the small size and transparency of the zebrafish brain in combination with state of the art imaging, genetically encoded probes, a custom software platform and biophysical modeling to study circuits at the cellular and molecular levels.",Circuits underlying threat and safety,10218722,U01NS122082,"['Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Anxiety', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Control Animal', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Display', 'Detection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Excitatory Synapse', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'FAIR principles', 'Fishes', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Homologous Gene', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inhibitory Synapse', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Location', 'Mammals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Periodicity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Property', 'Recombinants', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'calcium indicator', 'cell type', 'classical conditioning', 'conditioning', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'physical state', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'signal processing', 'voltage']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U01,2021,4718512
"Dissociable neural mechanisms of reactive versus appetitive aggression Project Summary  Maladaptive aggression characterizes - or is comorbid with - many neuropsychiatric illnesses, and can have devastating effects on individuals, their caretakers, and healthcare professionals. Human aggression is typically demarcated as exhibiting either reactive (defensive) or appetitive (rewarding) components, and a growing literature indicates they are heavily influenced by dysregulation in amygdalar or reward circuitry, respectively. Despite a significant clinical awareness of the fundamental differences between these aggression presentations, direct preclinical characterization of their relative circuitry and associated neuronal mechanisms are currently absent. Therefore, the aim of my proposal is to obtain the obtain the necessary computational, behavioral and anatomical training to identify, interrogate, and manipulate neural populations that modulate these disparate aggressive behaviors.  This project will focus on identifying lateral septum (LS) circuit and cell-type specific mechanisms that control of reactive versus appetitive aggression, and then further interrogate the afferent projections driving these populations. The choice of this brain region is based on converging preliminary data, including my own, implicating that the LS may confer opposing roles in regulating appetitive versus reactive aggression. The circuit and cell-type specific activation of the LS will be identified using a combination of Fos (a marker of neuronal activity) immunohistochemistry, multiplex in situ hybridization, and retrograde viral tracing. Because of the limited temporal resolution of Fos during these behaviors, awake-behaving fiber photometry recording will be used to observe how LS neurons encode these types of aggression in real-time. Next, the causal significance of the LS and its afferent projections will be examined using region, circuit, and cell-type specific optogenetic manipulations. Understanding the neural mechanisms driving these types of aggression will allow for the development of more specific and effective treatments for maladaptive aggression presenting comorbid with neuropsychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Maladaptive aggression characterizes - or is comorbid with - many neuropsychiatric illnesses, and can have devastating effects on individuals, their caretakers, and healthcare professionals. Despite a long-standing knowledge of the deleterious effects of maladaptive aggression, current treatment options are largely used as pharmacological restraints rather than targeted therapies. The aim of this proposal is to seek out and establish new mechanisms underlying reactive and appetitive aggression, possibly revealing novel therapeutic targets with higher efficacy and decreased off-target effects.",Dissociable neural mechanisms of reactive versus appetitive aggression,10150355,F31MH125587,"['Acute', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Anatomy', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain region', 'Breeding', 'Calcium', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Desire for food', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Experimental Designs', 'Fiber', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pharmacology', 'Photometry', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Rhodopsin', 'Role', 'Running', 'Self Administration', 'Social Behavior', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Viral', 'Wireless Technology', 'awake', 'base', 'cell type', 'comorbidity', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'genetic approach', 'in vivo', 'increased appetite', 'insight', 'interest', 'male', 'neuroethology', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'restraint', 'reward circuitry', 'serial imaging', 'social', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2021,43944
"Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models ABSTRACT  Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease (after Alzheimer's disease), afflicting tens of millions worldwide. The characteristic disease symptoms arise from basal ganglia dysfunction that occurs secondary to loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Symptomatic treatment is focused either on replacing dopamine or disrupting aberrant activity through deep- brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus or the primary basal ganglia output nucleus in the primate, internal globus pallidus (GPi). This proposal is aimed at understanding the function and dysfunction of basal ganglia circuitry in mice, at the output of the basal ganglia to motor thalamus. In Aim 1, we will develop strategies to identify basal ganglia-recipient motor thalamus neurons in ventral anterior/ventral lateral thalamus (VA/VL), and characterize their projection targets and cortical inputs in awake, behaving animals. In Aim 2, we will use sophisticated in vivo strategies to record from posterior EP neurons and VA/VL neurons as animals move their limbs during locomotion, a fixed repetitive behavior. We will perturb activity in this pathway using optogenetics to determine the contribution of activity in these neurons to forelimb movements, and we will examine how activity in this pathway is altered after loss of striatal dopamine. In Aim 3, we will perform similar experiments in mice performing a lever-pulling task, a flexible forelimb movement. We will examine both cued and uncued versions of this task to distinguish activity generated internally vs. externally. Finally, we will examine how loss of striatal dopamine impacts EP and VA/VL activity during flexible forelimb movements. Our overarching goal is to understand how loss of striatal dopamine in PD leads to disruptions in basal ganglia circuit function and motor deficits, in order to develop novel therapeutic strategies for treating PD motor symptoms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Parkinson's disease (PD) results from a progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the midbrain, most of which innervate the basal ganglia. Here, we propose to study the effects of dopamine loss in mice, focusing on the function of the entopeduncular nucleus (a rodent equivalent of the internal globus pallidus, major output nucleus of the basal ganglia, and a site of deep brain stimulation in PD) and the ventral motor thalamus. Remarkably, the function of these regions remains mysterious, yet they hold great promise for understanding PD and developing new therapeutic strategies for treating PD symptoms.",Neuron- and Circuit-Specific Mechanisms and Adaptations Regulating Motor Function in Parkinson Disease Models,10093142,R01NS064984,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Axon', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Brain Stem', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Characteristics', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dopamine', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Eye Movements', 'Forelimb', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homologous Gene', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Locomotion', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Primates', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Scheme', 'Secondary to', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Structure of subthalamic nucleus', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'Subthalamic structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Wild Type Mouse', 'awake', 'base', 'body position', 'cell type', 'deep learning', 'density', 'dopaminergic neuron', 'endopeduncular nucleus', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'motor behavior', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'motor symptom', 'mouse model', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'optogenetics', 'parkinsonian rodent', 'pars compacta', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'repetitive behavior', 'symptom treatment', 'tool']",NINDS,J.

"Multimodal, integrated analysis of neural activity and naturalistic social behavior in freely moving mice Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal responds to an NIMH notice NOT-MH-18-036 aimed at the development and study of novel, computationally defined behavioral assays, and at applying theory and mathematical modeling to better capture the richness of complex, naturalistic behaviors. Specifically, we aim to develop novel computational tools for analyzing social behaviors in freely moving mice, and relating those identified behaviors to neural circuit activity in brain regions that govern the expression of those behaviors. Social behavior is affected in many human psychiatric disorders, such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. We propose an interdisciplinary, collaborative approach to fill two major gaps that present a barrier to studies of social behavior: 1) the lack of quantitative and high-resolution descriptions of naturalistic social behaviors in freely moving animals, and 2) the difficulty of relating neural activity recorded in deep subcortical regions that govern such behaviors, such as the hypothalamus and extended amygdala, to animals' actions or to models of behavioral control. Our objective is to create a computational behavior analysis platform that integrates automated measurement of naturalistic social behavior, synchronous large-scale recording or imaging of neural activity, and apply these to a novel assay to investigate social behavioral decision-making. The central objective of this proposal is to extend our Mouse Action Recognition System (MARS) to create a platform that allows facile training of supervised and unsupervised behavior classifiers, quantitative correlation with simultaneously acquired neural recording or imaging data, and which can be flexibly adapted to additional behavior assays. The rationale for this approach is that fine-grained quantification of social behavior, and its correlation with neural recordings, is necessary to form and test theories of behavioral control by subcortical brain regions. While automated tracking and “pose” estimation software such as DeepLabCut have made tracking of animals' body positions more feasible, the identification of social behaviors from pose data is a non-trivial problem, requiring a separate computational approach that takes into account the relative movements of multiple animals over time. To achieve our objective, we will broaden the palette of social behaviors MARS can detect using machine learning and generative models (Aim 1), develop methods to relate those behaviors to neural activity (Aim 2), and extend MARS to additional assays to study neural correlates of social decision-making. This contribution is significant because it will create a resource that will transform our ability to study micro- and meso-scale subcortical circuits controlling social behavior. The contribution is innovative because it combines expertise from circuit neuroscience and computer vision/machine learning to create new tools for understanding the link between neural activity and behavior, in a context that is relevant to understanding dysfunctions of neural circuits that underlie human psychiatric disorders. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it develops new methods to investigate the neural circuits governing naturalistic social behaviors in animal models, and such behaviors are often disrupted in human psychiatric disorders such as autism, schizophrenia, and depression. Our objective is to use computer vision and machine learning algorithms (AI) to produce detailed and reproducible measurements capturing the richness of social behaviors, and to correlate those behaviors with simultaneously recorded neural activity in freely interacting animals. We apply these techniques in established and novel social behavior assays to test hypotheses about the neural mechanisms underlying social behavioral decision-making.","Multimodal, integrated analysis of neural activity and naturalistic social behavior in freely moving mice",10226273,R01MH123612,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Behavioral Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurosciences', 'Performance', 'Population Dynamics', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Reciprocal Social Interaction', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Identification', 'Social Interaction', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triad Acrylic Resin', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'body position', 'collaborative approach', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'neuromechanism', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'social defeat', 'social structure', 'temporal measurement', 'theories', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,416250
"MULTIREGIONAL ELECTRICAL ENCODING OF SOCIAL AGGRESSION MULTIREGIONAL ELECTRICAL ENCODING OF SOCIAL AGGRESSION Critical developments in neuroscience have included technologies for sequencing individual brain cells, progress towards completing a full mesoscale brain cell atlas in mice, new tools for monitoring and manipulating the activity of brain cells, refined imaging techniques for developing structural and functional connectome atlases in humans, and new objective measures for characterizing behavior across species. Nevertheless, a critical gap that has yet to be addressed is the development of a model that would allow this emerging catalog of cellular information to be linked to the broad functional networks that encode emotional behavior in mammals. This gap exists in part because 1) technologies that measure, monitor, and decode mesoscale activity throughout the depth of the brain during free behavior in mammalian model species have yet to be implemented in conjunction with cellular activity can be monitored and manipulated, and 2) theoretical frameworks that link cellular activity to mesoscale network activity and that generalize across subjects on a mouse-by-mouse basis have yet to be developed. Our multi-disciplinary team has built a suite of tools for studying how brain dynamics encode complex brain states. These include advanced techniques to measure and monitor brain dynamics in vivo concurrently for months across many regions located throughout the depth of the brain at high spatiotemporal resolution in freely-behaving mice, machine-learning analytic approaches that build individual circuit activity measures into composite networks, behavioral manipulations that can be used to induce brain states related to emotions, viral methods that probe the relationship between cellular changes and the expression of brain-wide neural dynamics, and closed-loop stimulation tools that can potentially test the causality of brain network-states in mediating emotion. By integrating this suite of tools in a single framework, we intend to create a model that will catalogue how the brain generates aggression. Critically, we believe that this model framework will be broadly applicable to other emotional brain states as well. Many cortical and subcortical brain regions work together to coordinate social emotional brain states. In this study we propose to build a model from experimental data that explains how these regions work together to generate aggression. We will test this model using established and emerging therapeutics utilized to treat aggression in the clinic, and we will develop new brain stimulation methodologies to regulate aggressive brain states uncovered by our model.",MULTIREGIONAL ELECTRICAL ENCODING OF SOCIAL AGGRESSION,10124784,R01MH125430,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Agonist', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral Paradigm', 'Biological', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dopamine', 'Electrodes', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Experimental Models', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Guanfacine', 'Habenula', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Instinct', 'Lateral', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Music', 'Neurosciences', 'Operating System', 'Output', 'Oxytocin', 'Peptides', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sensorimotor functions', 'Serotonin', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Social Network', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Viral', 'Vision', 'Work', 'brain cell', 'cellular targeting', 'connectome', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'emotional behavior', 'experimental study', 'free behavior', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'instrument', 'machine learning method', 'millisecond', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neuroregulation', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensorimotor system', 'social', 'spatial integration', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,304597
"Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons Project Summary During development, neurons acquire a polarized, elongated, and complex morphology, which requires a significant expansion of plasma membrane surface area. Surface increases have been estimated to reach upward of 20% per day, which far exceeds concomitant neuronal volume increases. We previously demonstrated that SNARE-mediated exocytosis is required during neuritogenesis and axon branching, presumably to provide membrane material to the expanding plasma membrane, which can only stretch ~2-3% prior to rupture. Asymmetric exocytosis has also been implicated in the attractive axonal turning responses that are critical for axon guidance. Achieving proper neuronal morphogenesis and connectivity is central to the formation of a functional nervous system. Together these factors underscore the significance of regulated exocytosis in developing neurons, even prior to synaptogenesis. Over the last 40 years, a multitude of components involved in exocytosis have been identified, although this list is not exhaustive. Further, mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, or spatiotemporal organization of vesicle fusion with the membrane, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal morphogenesis, have not been defined. To visualize exocytic events in developing neurons, we express a pH-sensitive variant of GFP (pHluorin) attached to the lumenal side of a v-SNARE, such as VAMP2 or VAMP7, to illuminate the occurrence of fusion pore opening between the acidic vesicular lumen and the neutral extracellular space. Analysis of such images has remained a time-intensive, non-automated bottleneck, delaying understanding of this fundamental cellular behavior. We developed a fully-automated computer- vision software for the detection and analysis of VAMP-pHluorin mediated exocytic events that will quantitatively reveal the spatial and temporal organization and regulation of exocytosis in developing neurons at a level of detail previously unattainable. We exploit this innovative methodology along with unbiased proteomics, microfluidics, biochemical and cell biological approaches to investigate the relationship between exocytosis and neuronal morphogenesis and identifying the molecular mechanisms that regulate exocytosis in developing neurons. PROJECT NARRATIVE During development, neurons acquire a highly elongated, polarized and complex cell shape that requires a dramatic expansion of the neuronal surface area or plasma membrane, which is hypothesized to be fueled by vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane. We will define mechanisms that regulate the mode, progression, frequency, and organization of vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane of developing neurons, all of which are poised to modulate neuronal cell shape.",Exocytosis fuels plasma membrane expansion in developing neurons,10159320,R01NS112326,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Cell Shape', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Clathrin', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Distal', 'Endocytosis', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exocytosis', 'Extracellular Space', 'Frequencies', 'Growth Cones', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Lateral', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Membrane', 'Methodology', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphogenesis', 'Morphology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurites', 'Neurons', 'PHluorin', 'PTK2 gene', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphorylation', 'Population', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Regulation of Exocytosis', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Running', 'Rupture', 'SNAP receptor', 'Side', 'Stretching', 'Surface', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Tetanus', 'Time', 'Total Internal Reflection Fluorescent', 'Variant', 'Vesicle', 'axon guidance', 'cell behavior', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'novel', 'physical model', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'synaptogenesis', 'vesicular SNARE proteins']",NINDS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,384007
"Circuit Dynamics for encoding and remembering sequence of events Project Summary We experience the world as a continuous sequence of events, but we remember the events as segmented episodes (e.g., my sister’s wedding). During encoding, we associate a sequence of relevant events and segment deviant events. At retrieval, episodic memory utilizes the encoded associations to replay the flow of events. The encoded associations lead to remembering the sequence of events that occurred within an episode better than the flow of events across segments. The hippocampus and the prefrontal cortices (PFC) are essential parts of the neural circuit for segmenting, linking and retrieving memories of associated events. This proposal aims to identify neural dynamics in the hippocampus-PFC circuit that support encoding a naturalistic flow of events, i.e., sequences of words. We will determine the neural dynamics using intracranial encephalography (iEEG) acquired from the hippocampus and PFC of epileptic patients, who have electrodes implemented for pre-surgical seizure monitoring. Our experiment requires patients to listen to a narrative and later recall the flow of events. During the past year, I developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm that quantifies the associations of words depending on the narrative context. I will use NLP model for annotation of the iEEG data to determine neural dynamics engaged during encoding sequences of words. Our research program (mainly data collection), like all other human subject research, has been significantly affected by the COVID mitigation efforts. We were not able to collect the required iEEG data to fulfill the aims of the planned K99 phase during the past year. With the vaccination of researchers and medical staff and screening of patients before the hospitalization, our data collection program is reopening with considerations. The extension to the K99 will allow us to catch up with the data collection that is required for the planned training on advanced data analysis. The central hypotheses are that bidirectional communications between the hippocampus and PFC support the encoding of sequences of events and successful subsequent memory. To address a causal relationship between hippocampal function and event segmentation, I will study speech comprehension and speech memory in developmental amnesic patients who suffer from hippocampal damage and have trouble tracking reference points in a speech. The combination of iEEG, NLP modeling, and patients’ behavioral data will provide valuable insights into the neural dynamics of effective speech encoding that predicts subsequent memory, which may inform development into therapeutic interventions. Project Narrative The ability to segment the world into meaningful episodes engages the human hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Using direct electrophysiological recording from the human brain, advanced analytical techniques, Natural Language Processing models, and the behavior of patients with hippocampal lesions, this proposal will determine the neural dynamics for efficient encoding of sequences of words that predicts successful memory formation.

"Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors Project Summary Behavior is movement, and the effective and efficient execution of movement has served as a fundamental evolutionary force shaping the form and function of the nervous system. Control of the forelimbs to interact with the world is one of the most essential achievements of the mammalian motor system, yet unfortunately these behaviors are particularly vulnerable to disease and injury. The execution of skilled limb movements requires the continuous refinement of motor output across dozens of muscles, suggesting the existence of feedback pathways that enable rapid adjustments. The temporal delays of peripheral pathways, however, suggest that sensory feedback alone cannot explain the sophistication of online motor control. In principle, a more rapid source of feedback would be to convey copies of motor commands internally to the cerebellum to generate predictions of motor outcome, reducing dependence on delayed sensory information. Yet putative copy circuits have been difficult to isolate experimentally, leaving their contributions to movement unclear. Mouse genetic tools offer a means to explore a diverse class of spinal interneurons as a neural substrate for internal copies. Cervical propriospinal neurons (PNs) receive descending motor command input and extend bifurcating axons; one branch projects to forelimb motor neurons and the other projects to the lateral reticular nucleus (LRN), a major cerebellar input, providing an anatomically straightforward means to convey motor copies internally. Yet how diverse classes of PN-LRN circuits are organized and how they each contribute to distinct elements of limb behavior remain unclear. Complicating the problem, the field lacks robust ways for deconstructing complex limb movements into component elements (e.g. reaching, grasping, postural control), and objective means for quantifying these behaviors in mice. Hypothesis: Discrete classes of PN circuits convey distinct types of spinal motor copy information to the LRN, each necessary for separate aspects of forelimb control; this functional logic can be resolved with more quantitative, high-resolution and standardized behavioral assays. To test this overarching hypothesis, Aim 1 uses molecular-genetic circuit mapping approaches and single-cell RNA- sequencing to define the anatomical and molecular organization of four classes of PN-LRN circuits. Identifying the fine-grained structure of these diverse pathways will be essential for establishing how internal copies are conveyed to the cerebellum to control forelimb behavior. Aim 2 addresses the need for more sensitive and unbiased behavioral tools by developing novel assays of discrete elements of forelimb behavior and machine learning approaches for automated quantification of forelimb kinematics. Finally, Aim 3 merges these novel behavioral approaches with intersectional genetic tools, electrophysiological recording and circuit-specific perturbation to functionally dissect PN-LRN circuits and define their modular contributions to dexterous limb control. Ultimately, these studies will yield insight into the function of internal copy circuits throughout the nervous system, and help to lay the foundation for better diagnosis and treatment of motor deficits. Project Narrative In addition to promoting basic science investigation of motor function, this work can impact the study of motor dysfunction. Skilled movements of the arm and hand are particularly susceptible to disease and injury of the motor system, raising the need for a better understanding of motor circuit organization and more informative strategies for studying the behaviors these circuits control. Merging molecular-genetic tools with novel behavioral approaches will offer a more detailed and comprehensive approach to studying movement, helping to provide greater insight into the neural basis of motor deficits as well as more effective ways to restore or replace lost motor function.","Defining the anatomical, molecular and functional logic of internal copy circuits involved in dexterous forelimb behaviors",10201782,R01NS111479,"['Ablation', 'Achievement', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Axon', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebellum', 'Cervical', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Disease', 'Dissection', 'Distal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Forelimb', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Limb structure', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Motor output', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Musculoskeletal Equilibrium', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Postural adjustments', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Rabies', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Spinal', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Wrist', 'arm movement', 'behavioral study', 'experimental study', 'grasp', 'improved', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'limb movement', 'molecular subtypes', 'motor control', 'motor deficit', 'motor disorder', 'mouse genetics', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensory feedback', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'theories', 'tool']",NINDS,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2021,587128
"Digital behavioral phenotyping and multi-region electrophysiology to determine behavioral and neural network changes underlying the stress response in mice ABSTRACT: Chronic psychological stress triggers and exacerbates major depressive disorder (MDD) and many other psychiatric conditions – causing changes in sleep, eating habits, addictive behaviors, activity levels, circadian rhythms, mood and other domains. The rodent stress response shares many behavioral and physiologic alterations with that of humans. Chronic stress also has broad effects on the brain. But major gaps exist in our knowledge in regard to the integrated behavior and physiology as well as the corresponding brain circuit changes with chronic stress. Prior work has found many behavioral and physiologic phenotypes of stress, but we lack a cohesive sense of how these variables co-evolve over time. Our first aim is to delineate this co-evolution of stress response elements in stressed versus unstressed mice. We will accomplish this by examining mice under a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) paradigm versus controls in our new naturalistic observation system the “Digital Homecage”. This system allows us to monitor over 50 behavioral measures simultaneously over weeks. Mice will live in these homecages for 8 weeks: 2 weeks baseline, 4 weeks CUS and 2 weeks of recovery. An exploratory element of that aim is to use machine learning to determine a coherent mouse stress biomarker for future quantitative studies. Our next goal is to determine electrophysiologic signatures of chronic stress. It is known that chronic stress alters brain circuit synaptic structure and neuromodulatory balance. It is known that the behavior is controlled by the electrophysiologic state of brain networks and that those networks operate both locally within regions and via coordinated multi-regional transmission. Therefore, we aim to study changes in electrophysiology both within and across regions. We focus on the medial prefrontal cortex, the ventral hippocampus and infralimbic medial prefrontal cortex given their strong involvement in chronic stress. We will implant tetrode arrays into these regions and will record over 8 weeks as above. In Aim 2, we will determine the effects of chronic stress on within-region spiking tendencies including spike rate variability and excitatory- inhibitory balance. In a second part of this aim we will use machine learning applied to a wider variety of within- region dynamical measures to determine a potentially more complete set of differences between CUS and control mice. In our final Aim, we will assess cross-regional coordination between these 3 regions. We will test the hypothesis that pairwise coupling between regions will be altered in a manner consistent with MDD by measuring coupling using both spiking and LFP. Again, we will then use machine learning methods on our large dataset to detect further inter-regional dynamics un-revealed in our hypothesis-driven testing. This mixture of behavior and electrophysiology is done to generate new understanding about chronic stress. We also have a long-term vision of creating large dataset for future analysis, a fully-refined Digital Homecage system for future studies, with an eye towards developing interventions based on natural electrophysiologic circuit function. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stress has a central role in mental health conditions and improved understanding of how stress affects brain and body could deliver great potential clinical impact. To determine the brain and body responses to varying stressors we will use novel instrumentation to measure 50+ behavioral metrics at sub-second resolution together with multi-brain site electrophysiology over weeks. We will then determine how varying stressors affect circadian and broader changes across animal behavior and physiology as well as neural circuit dynamics.",Digital behavioral phenotyping and multi-region electrophysiology to determine behavioral and neural network changes underlying the stress response in mice,10199475,R01MH126137,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Anhedonia', 'Animal Behavior', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Behavior monitoring', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Body Temperature', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Chronic stress', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Diet Habits', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Eating', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Equilibrium', 'Evolution', 'Eye', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grooming', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Intervention', 'Ketamine', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Psychological Stress', 'REM Sleep', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Response Elements', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Solid', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Sucrose', 'Suggestion', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vision', 'Work', 'actigraphy', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'circadian', 'cohesion', 'data structure', 'digital', 'field study', 'forced swim test', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instrumentation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'preference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stressor', 'transmission process']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,681455
"Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance Project Summary Social deficits are common in psychiatric disorders and available treatments are limited. Our lack of basic knowledge on how the brain controls social behaviors makes it challenging to develop therapeutics for social deficits. For numerous animal species, social rank dictates many aspects of behavior, such as access to resources and resilience to stress. Individuals with higher social rank typically win more often during social conflicts (e.g. food competition) and show more agonistic behaviors; collectivity referred to as dominance behaviors. Cross-species evidence suggests that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays an important role in social dominance. However, exactly how the mPFC encodes social rank and which mPFC inputs and outputs contribute to dominance behaviors is unknown. Multiple studies show that the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) is necessary for social memory, and more recently, a study showed that this role involves vHPC input to the mPFC. Furthermore, preliminary data suggest that the projection from the mPFC to the lateral hypothalamus (LH) modulates social dominance behavior. These findings in combination with the literature suggest a model in which the mPFC receives social memory information from the vHPC and guides social behaviors via modulation of LH GABAergic and glutamatergic subpopulations. Progress in uncovering neural correlates of social behavior has been limited by the tools used to characterize murine social behavior, since existing social assays lack trial- structure needed for statistical power and common measurements of social behavior are simplistic (e.g. sniffing). Overcoming this challenge required developing a trial-based social competition assay in which mice compete against cagemates for a reward signaled by a tone. Due to its trial structure, this assay facilitates the quantification of social behaviors and subsequently the identification of neural correlates for social dominance. In this assay, dominant mice win most of the rewards across trials, occupy the reward port and displace mice from the reward port more often than subordinates. Machine learning approaches will be used to profile the behavioral differences seen across social rank during the competition assay. Utilizing this ethologically relevant social competition assay, circuit manipulations, in vivo neural recording methods and machine learning allows testing the hypothesis that the tripartite vHPC-mPFC-LH circuit encodes social dominance. Altogether, this research will provide a new approach to study social dominance and will further our understanding of how the distributed circuits of the mPFC modulate social behavior. Furthermore, pinpointing the neural circuits underlying social behaviors will facilitate identification of potential therapeutics for social deficits in psychiatric disorders. Finally, completion of this research will provide training opportunities in statistical approaches for behavioral analysis and new circuit dissection tools, which are essential for the candidate to become an expert in social neuroscience and to start a successful independent research program. Project Narrative Social behavior deficits are key features of many psychiatric disorders, yet little is known about how the brain controls normal social behaviors. I propose to dissect the role of the medial prefrontal cortex circuits in social dominance by combining wireless electrophysiology, calcium imaging, optogenetics and machine learning. This study will broaden our understanding of how neural circuits control normal social behaviors and will contribute to the identification of novel interventions for social deficits.",Studying how the hippocampal-prefrontal-hypothalamic circuit encodes social dominance,10167793,K99MH124435,"['Affect', 'Agonistic Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Assay', 'Calcium', 'Cells', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Dissection', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Food', 'Frequencies', 'Glutamates', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Opsin', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'cell cortex', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'mind control', 'neural circuit', 'neural correlate', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'recruit', 'redshift', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'social', 'social competition', 'social deficits', 'social interventions', 'social neuroscience', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,K99,2021,123390
"Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies   Project Summary Decades of psychology research have shown that working memory is limited, and humans can only hold a few items in mind at the same time. However, cognitive tasks like planning and problem solving require access to many pieces of information at once. To overcome this constraint, we enlist mnemonic strategies, for instance grouping pieces of information into chunks, as we commonly do to remember telephone or social security numbers. Mnemonic chunking allows us to flexibly organize information on line, providing a fundamental building block for advanced cognitive abilities. Chunking impairments occur when damage or dysfunction involves the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), for instance in patients with schizophrenia, and severely compromises overall cognitive function. Thus, determining how the brain organizes information is a necessary step toward understanding the mechanisms of advanced cognition, and how these go awry in disease states. A key challenge is that strategies for organizing information are self-generated and highly variable in a laboratory setting. A central innovation of this proposal is the novel computational approach used to identify spontaneous mnemonic chunking in macaque monkeys. This is critical because animal models allow us to interrogate brain function with advanced neurophysiological tools. Here, we will use high-density, multi-site recording and targeted neuromodulation to understand the circuit mechanisms that chunk mnemonic information. Previous theoretical work suggests that chunks arise from compressed working memory representations that act as neural shorthand, economizing on processing resources at the cost of degrading some original information. Neurons in dlPFC encode items in working memory, and their dynamics are shaped by recurrent interactions with the basal ganglia. Thus, we hypothesize that corticostriatal interactions promote the efficient reorganization of working memory that underlies chunking. To test this we will investigate dlPFC- striatal dynamics when monkeys spontaneously chunk information in a self-organized working memory task. We will record large numbers of single neurons and local field potentials, and dynamically decode representations held in working memory to assess how mnemonic codes and corticostriatal interactions change when items are or are not chunked. In addition, exogenous stimulation will test the causal role of striatal circuits in promoting the formation of mnemonic chunks. Together, these experiments will determine how the brain establishes mnemonic chunks to optimize working memory performance. This will shed light on a fundamental feature of advanced cognition, and how dysfunction in these mechanisms could give rise to disorders of thought and memory. Finally, understanding mechanisms that optimize cognitive function in a biological system may fuel creative advances that optimize performance in artificial intelligence systems.   Project Narrative This project focuses on understanding circuit dynamics in the prefrontal cortex that mediate mnemonic chunking, a critical strategy for improving working memory performance in advanced cognition. Specifically, we will assess how mnemonic information is bound together in the dynamics of frontal and striatal circuits, and whether these processes can be enhanced with targeted circuit modulation. Our results could provide insights into core deficits in cognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia, and open the door for novel approaches that enhance cognitive function in the setting of working memory deficits.",Circuit mechanisms of self-organized cognitive strategies,10098347,R01MH121480,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Brain', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Expert Systems', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Location', 'Macaca', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Monkeys', 'Motor', 'Neurons', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Primates', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Shorthand', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Security Number', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Systematic Bias', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Visual', 'Work', 'behavior test', 'biological systems', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive enhancement', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cost', 'density', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'information organization', 'innovation', 'insight', 'language comprehension', 'memory recall', 'microstimulation', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,460527
"Modeling a Neural Circuit for Flexible Control of Innate Behaviors The adaptive control of social behaviors, such as aggression and reproduction, is a critical function of the nervous system. In the past decade, new methods for genetically targeted functional manipulation and imaging of neural activity have proven phenomenally fruitful in identifying neural subpopulations that play a role in expression of social behaviors. But our understanding of how these neural populations work together in a behaving animal remains highly fractured. In the proposed work, we develop a computational approach to integrate neural imaging data from multiple genetically targeted neural populations and construct a circuit model of social behavior control. A significant challenge in studying social behavior is its high variability and complexity, features that defy traditional trial-averaging-based analyses of neural activity. To address this challenge, we will leverage our recently developed automated tracking system to build a quantitative and detailed model of social behaviors and sensory processing in pairs of freely interacting mice. This behavior model will provide the basis for a thorough statistical analysis of neural dynamics within and between a collection of four subcortical nuclei, which together span three putative layers of processing, the first just past the sensory periphery and the last just upstream of premotor populations in the periaqueductal gray. This analysis will include 1) predicting animals' future behavior from joint neural and behavioral models, 2) characterizing behavior tuning of individual neurons in each nucleus with a linear-nonlinear model, and 3) fitting a network model to imaging data from multiple nuclei, and testing predicted connectivity from this model with a novel optogenetic perturbation system. Finally, we will build on these analyses to address the flexibility of behavior control by network models of subcortical nuclei. In the K99 phase, this research plan will allow me to develop advanced skills in the use of deep learning and recurrent neural networks for data analysis: skills that will be increasingly important as more labs start to study complex behaviors and meso-scale neural circuits. The strong computational environment at Caltech, including the labs of Pietro Perona, Markus Meister, and Doris Tsao, makes it an ideal place to develop my technical training, while the strength of the Anderson lab's experimental program provides a unique chance to collaborate closely with experimentalists in testing and refining models. Additional training in data presentation, teaching, grant-writing, and student mentorship will allow me to transition to an independent position. In the independent R00 phase, I will use these skills and the objectives of my remaining Aims to build a laboratory focused on the study of flexibility and behavioral adaptability in meso-scale neural circuits. Project Narrative This project investigates the network of densely interconnected brain areas that regulate complex social behavior in mammals. A tremendous number of neuropsychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, autism, generalized anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder, impair or alter patients' social interactions and motivations. In this proposal, I use theory and modeling to bridge the gap from micro-level understanding of local brain activity to a meso-scale model of how brain areas act in concert to shape behavior, providing a tool to better understand mechanisms that disrupt their collective function.",Modeling a Neural Circuit for Flexible Control of Innate Behaviors,10269964,R00MH117264,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animal Housing', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Dimensions', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Fracture', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Hunger', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instinct', 'Joints', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mammals', 'Manuals', 'Medial', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Neurons', 'Non-linear Models', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Preoptic Areas', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproduction', 'Research', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Controls', 'Social Interaction', 'Social status', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'generalized anxiety', 'midbrain central gray substance', 'multimodality', 'neglect', 'network models', 'neural circuit', 'neural model', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'predictive test', 'programs', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'social', 'stressor', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIMH,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R00,2021,244320
"Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory Project Summary / Abstract Ascertaining the neural basis of behavior has been a cornerstone goal since the conception of neurobiology. While activity recording and loss-of-function studies have shed light on brain regions involved and necessary for the expression of certain behaviors, they are unable to determine the information each circuit is responsible for encoding. Therefore, when different nodes in the circuit are removed, the behavioral phenotype is often identical. Synaptic plasticity, the ability of synapses to change functional strength depending on experience, is considered the cellular correlate of learning and memory. Linking changes in the functional strength of synapses following behavior has begun to indicate what information circuits are responsible for encoding. To provide direct evidence, a tool that is able to modulate synaptic plasticity in specific circuit nodes during behavior is needed. The goal of this proposal is to create a photo-activatable inhibitor of presynaptic plasticity that will be input- and region- specific for use in behaving animals. The first aim of the proposal will create and screen constructs of photo-activatable PKI (paPKI) in their efficacy for the inhibition of protein kinase A, a kinase necessary for the induction of presynaptic plasticity. Light-dependency will be ensured and the construct will be evaluated based on its sensitivity and selectivity using advanced imaging techniques (2-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging) and biochemical assays. The second aim of the proposal will use paPKI to determine the role of specific circuit nodes in social memory. Input-specific modulation of plasticity will be paired with in depth behavioral analyses using computer vision to parse out subtle differences in social interaction. These aims directly address the BRAIN Initiative 2025 high priority goal #4: the modulation of neural activity with readouts of behavior using advanced computer vision techniques. The proposed fellowship project provides excellent training potential as it expands from the applicant’s current training in systems/circuit neuroscience to molecular and biophysical neuroscience. The project is an intersection between the mentor’s, Dr. Ryohei Yasuda, expertise in molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity and the development and advanced imaging of biomodulators and sensors, and the applicant’s expertise in circuitry underlying social memory, electrophysiology and behavioral analyses using computer vision. The Max Planck Florida Institute for Neuroscience is an intensely collaborative environment filled with leaders in the field and exceptional resources, resulting in an institute that is highly productive and influential. This fellowship proposal presents excellent training potential and aims to produce tools that will advance the field. Project Narrative While the ability to discern an appropriate behavioral response during social encounters is of quintessential importance in communally living animals, the neural circuitry storing social memories that guide this behavioral choice are poorly understood. Here, we will harness and develop novel molecular tools to manipulate synaptic plasticity in an input-specific manner to discern the specific role of each node in a social memory circuit. Additionally, the tools developed in this proposal will be applicable to studies discerning the neural circuitry underlying other forms of learning and memory facilitating greater understanding of neural computations underlying behavior and how these may be altered in neuropsychiatric diseases.",Input-specific imaging and manipulation of synaptic plasticity underlying social memory,10163915,F32MH120872,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Animals', 'Assessment tool', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Response Modifiers', 'Biophysics', 'Brain region', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Conceptions', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Fellowship', 'Florida', 'Goals', 'Hela Cells', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Institutes', 'Investigation', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Presynaptic Terminals', 'Protein Inhibition', 'Protein Kinase A Inhibitor', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Characteristics', 'Social Dominance', 'Social Interaction', 'Specificity', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic plasticity', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral response', 'calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'commune', 'experience', 'fluorescence lifetime imaging', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'link protein', 'loss of function', 'neural circuit', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmitter release', 'novel', 'optical fiber', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'protein kinase inhibitor', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'sensor', 'social', 'social learning', 'tool', 'two-photon']",NIMH,MAX PLANCK FLORIDA CORPORATION,F32,2021,73562
"Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis Understanding the function of the nervous system requires a sophisticated understanding of its main output, behavior. Although our ability to record from and to manipulate neurons and neural circuits has accelerated at a spectacular pace over the last decade, progress has lagged in coupling the interrogation of the nervous system to similarly high-resolution measures of behavior. As a consequence, we lack a sophisticated understanding of how the brain composes, modifies and controls action.  We have recently developed a transformative behavioral characterization technology called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq), which circumvents many of the limitations imposed by typical approaches to behavioral measurement (e.g., overtraining, head-fixation, limited behavioral flexibility). This analytical system works by capturing comprehensive and continuous morphometric data about the three-dimensional (3D) posture of a mouse as it freely behaves. The 3D data are then analyzed using an unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify patterns of motion that correspond to stereotyped and reused modules of sub-second behavior (which by analogy to natural language we refer to as behavioral “syllables”). The output of this fitting procedure is a parts list for behavior: a limited set of syllables out of which the rodent creates all of its observable action. In addition, within any given experiment MoSeq identifies the specific transition structure (or “grammar”) that places individual syllables into sequences; these sequences encode all patterns of spontaneous behavior expressed by an animal in a given experimental context. We have recently combined this behavioral assessment technology with techniques for neural recording, allowing us to assess the relationship between neural activity in behaviorally-relevant circuits and patterns of action. This combined approach allowed us, for example, to identify a code for elemental 3D pose dynamics in striatum; importantly, these observed correlations validate MoSeq as a technology that enables accurate inference of internal states from external states. However, the code that underlies MoSeq is essentially bespoke, inappropriate for distribution, and difficult for all but expert users to navigate. In addition, implementing MoSeq in its current form requires extensive prior mathematical and computational experience, limiting its use to a small set of users with specialized skills. Here we propose Aims to democratize MoSeq by (1) transforming it into an end-to-end pipeline that can be easily used by graduate-student level neuroscientists with minimal expertise, and which can be modified on an ongoing basis to accommodate improvements to MoSeq and (2) to offer hands-on training in the set-up and appropriate use of MoSeq for characterizing behavior and neural-behavioral relationships. Together these aims will create a vibrant community of MoSeq users; the creation of such a group has the potential to transform the way behavior is analyzed across neuroscience, and promises to lead to broad insights into the many and varied relationships between neural circuits and behavior. A central goal of neurobiology is to reveal how the brain generates and organizes action, but we lack sophisticated tools for objectively and comprehensively characterizing behavior. We have developed a next- generation method called Motion Sequencing (MoSeq) that affords unprecedented insight into how the brain organizes behavior; however, using this approach requires substantial expertise, which has slowed its adoption by the scientific community. Here we propose to streamline and package the underlying code, and to offer hands-on training, so that users without extensive computer science or math backgrounds can easily use MoSeq to characterize animal behavior as part of efforts to understand how genes, drugs or neural activity changes action.","Motion Sequencing for All: pipelining, distribution and training to enable broad adoption of a next-generation platform for behavioral and neurobehavioral analysis",9902565,U24NS109520,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Animal Behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Calcium', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Educational workshop', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rodent', 'Stereotyping', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'awake', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cell type', 'computer science', 'data format', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'graphical user interface', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'natural language', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'next generation', 'open source', 'relating to nervous system', 'sample fixation', 'skills', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'voltage', 'web services']",NINDS,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U24,2021,466672

"Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice Project Summary: Considerable evidence exists to support the notion that amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology impair neuronal circuit integrity and function in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Unfortunately, few studies have tested the direct influence of AD pathology on spatial computation within affected neuronal populations, resulting in an information gap at the neuronal network level. Moreover, in vivo experiments that examine large scale, neuronal network activity in mouse models of Aβ and tau pathology are lacking. In this proposal, I test the overarching hypothesis that Aβ and tau associated neuronal network dysfunction impairs task-relevant, spatial information encoding in large populations of neurons within the EC-HIPP circuit, and that combating this aberrant activity can restore order and improve spatial information processing in AD mice. In Aim 1, I will test the hypothesis that oligomeric forms of Aβ and tau disturb spatial information content encoded within large populations of neurons in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit. I will also test if these oligomeric peptides alter the number of neurons recruited into the population code responsible for memory encoding in a spatial learning and memory task. In Aims 2 & 3, I will leverage the predictive power of machine learning to decipher the neural code for spatial information processing in EC-HIPP population activity. Specifically, my goals in Aim 2 will be to examine the individual and combined impact of Aβ and tau pathologies on features of spatial information encoding in the EC-Tau/hAPP mouse line. In Aim 3, I will employ chemogenetics using a novel DREADDs ligand to combat aberrant neuronal activity in AD mouse models, with the ultimate goal of improving spatial information processing in neuronal networks burdened with pathology. Excitatory neurons will be specifically targeted in an effort to better understand their contribution to impaired spatial information processing in AD mouse models.  The proposed research aims are designed to bridge an information gap between AD-related cognitive impairment and the underlying circuit pathology. This Mentored Research Scientist Development (K01) Award will afford me the opportunity to accomplish this major goal while enriching my technical skillset and expanding my knowledge of AD pathophysiology. In addition, the integrated training and mentorship that I will receive will help me develop additional expertise in machine learning for spatial decoding analyses. Together, the proposed studies and career development plan will ensure that I achieve my long-term career goal of launching a competitive, independent research career at a major research university. Project Narrative The progressive accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with dysfunctional neuronal signaling and poor cognitive performance. In this proposal, newly developed machine learning strategies will be used to decode features of task-relevant, spatial information from neural ensemble activity in the entorhinal cortex – hippocampal (EC-HIPP) circuit of transgenic mice expressing Aβ and tau pathology, with the overarching goal of understanding how Aβ and tau interfere with spatial information encoded within neuronal networks. Dysfunctional neuronal populations will then be selectively targeted using chemogenetics to correct their aberrant firing patterns, with the aim of improving the quality of spatial information carried by pathology afflicted neuronal networks.",Impaired spatial decoding and neural population code rescaling in AD mice,10237353,K01AG068598,"['4-Hydroxy-Tamoxifen', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Amyloid beta-42', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Attenuated', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'J20 mouse', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor', 'Neuronal Dysfunction', 'Neurons', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Stimulus', 'Talents', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'abeta accumulation', 'attenuation', 'awake', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive performance', 'combat', 'design', 'designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs', 'entorhinal cortex', 'excitatory neuron', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'information processing', 'learning strategy', 'memory encoding', 'mouse model', 'network dysfunction', 'neuron loss', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neuronal patterning', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'spatial memory', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation']",NIA,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K01,2021,106388
