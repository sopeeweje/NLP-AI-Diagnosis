"Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate: Dr. Adel El Boueiz is a pulmonary and critical care physician-scientist completing a period of T32- funded support at the Channing Division of Network Medicine (CDNM) and Harvard Medical School (HMS). He received a Master's of Medical Science in Biomedical Informatics from HMS in May 2016. He will be promoted to Instructor of Medicine at the CDNM and HMS on July 1, 2017. His principal research interests are the genetic epidemiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the translation of genomic discoveries into clinical practice and public health. His long-term goal is to be an independent investigator with expertise in imaging phenotyping, genomics, and predictive analytics of the regional heterogeneity of the various aspects of COPD (emphysema, airway disease, and pulmonary vascular remodeling). Environment: Dr. El Boueiz will continue to pursue his research and career development in the rich and multidisciplinary environment of the CDNM and the Brigham and Women's Hospital Applied Chest Imaging Lab (ACIL). He will be mentored by Drs. Edwin K. Silverman, Peter J. Castaldi, and Raúl San José Estépar, leaders in the field of COPD quantitative imaging, genetic epidemiology, and predictive analytics with excellent track records of mentoring young investigators towards independent research careers. His career development will also be overseen by an advisory committee with expertise related to key areas of his proposal. Research: COPD is a major cause of morbidity and mortality that is of increasing public health importance. COPD is a heterogeneous disease and this heterogeneity complicates the identification of the predictors of disease progression and consequently, the development of effective therapies. Emphysema distribution is an important COPD-related phenotype that emerged as a strong predictor of the response to lung volume reduction procedures. Despite the availability of advanced texture-based CT quantification methods, global threshold-based quantitative metrics have to date been the cornerstone for the radiological characterization of emphysema distribution with inability to differentiate centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema patterns. In this project, we will apply a texture-based CT quantification method to discover novel imaging biomarkers of the regional heterogeneity of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema in a large cohort of well-characterized smokers and identify their genetic determinants using whole genome sequencing and integrative genomics analyses. The results will be considered for inclusion along with other rich phenotypic and imaging data in COPD disease progression machine learning predictive models. Relevance: Through improved radiographic phenotyping of emphysema distribution, better understanding of disease pathobiology, and more accurate prediction of disease progression, the proposed work will open new avenues of investigation for the development of personalized and improved COPD therapeutic strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease that affects up to 24 million people in the United States, is associated with considerable and increasing morbidity and mortality, and for which there is no available disease-modifying therapy. COPD is associated with significant variation in radiographic, symptomatic and physiologic presentation and exhibits variability in progression. Currently, there is no satisfactory method for progression prediction. This project will identify novel imaging biomarkers of the regional distribution of centrilobular, panlobular, and paraseptal emphysema with particular emphasis on their associations with clinical relevant COPD-related outcomes, their genetic determinants, and their ability to improve prediction of COPD disease progression, above and beyond that provided by the traditional clinical, radiographic, and genetic features. This is an important area of research as predicting those patients who will remain stable from those who will have rapid disease progression is critical in defining prognosis and selecting patients for specific therapeutic interventions.","Clinical significance and genetic determinants of novel imaging measures of emphysema distribution in 9,743 smokers",10208938,K08HL141601,"['ACVR1B gene', 'Accounting', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Airway Disease', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Chest', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical/Radiologic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dyspnea', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomic approach', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Investigation', 'Lobar', 'Lobe', 'Lung', 'Lung Volume Reductions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Structure of parenchyma of lung', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Visual', 'Walking', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'data mining', 'disease heterogeneity', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'disorder subtype', 'effective therapy', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'rare variant', 'research and development', 'respiratory', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2021,170639
"Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a fatal lung disease that is the fourth leading cause of death in the U.S. Despite an estimated $50 billion in yearly healthcare costs, it has no current cure and only palliat- ive treatments. COPD is clearly characterized by chronic lung inflammation that likely arises from dysregulat- ion of complex networks of immune factors and cells across multiple tissue compartments. Although multiple individual genes and proteins have been associated with COPD risk and progression, global mechanistic understanding of its pathophysiology is lacking, particularly regarding the marked heterogeneity in COPD phenotypes. The overall objective of our study is to gain systems-level insight into complex inflammatory and immune mechanisms underlying COPD, by applying data-driven (also called ‘machine learning’) modeling approaches to clinical samples collected from human pulmonary microenvironments and matched immune cell networks from peripheral blood. Our central hypothesis is that immune networks will be more predictive of COPD phenotype, progression, and exacerbation than individual factors. We will test this hypothesis in three Specific Aims, using matched brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) and blood samples collected in SPIROMICS I and II clinical trials. Aim 1 will identify changes in immune cell-cell communication networks, by high-throughput cytokine measurements from stimulated systems of peripheral blood immune cells from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls (collected from the upcoming SPIROMICS II visit; n=150). Aim 2 will determine systems-level changes that occur in the inflamed lung microenvironment, using high-throughput cytokine measurements in BAL samples (both archival from SPIROMICS I, n=200, and collected during upcoming SPIROMICS II bronchoscopies) from smokers with and without COPD and never-smoking controls. We will identify networks associated with longitudinal clinical progression and exacerbation frequency. Aim 3 will integrate measurements across lung and blood tissue compartments to define key combinatorial relationships associated with progression and exacerbation events. Overall, this project will provide systems- level insight into COPD pathogenesis and progression, and create a new paradigm for the study of other pulmonary conditions involving chronic inflammation, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, and lung transplant. Results will aid in the future development of new non-invasive diagnostic assays and will guide systems-level mechanistic studies that could result in new combinatorial therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of this proposal is to gain new systems-level insight into chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the third leading cause of death worldwide and an enormous cost burden in the U.S. yearly (~50 billion). Despite progress in identifying individual immune factors associated with COPD, there are only palliative treatment options and no cure. New insight generated by this project into how immune cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments are altered in COPD could be used to identify diagnostic biomarkers and to guide the design of combinatorial therapies.",Identification of immune cell-cell communication networks and inflammatory pulmonary microenvironments associated with the progression of COPD,10111555,R01HL144849,"['Accounting', 'Archives', 'Asthma', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Death Records', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Event', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologic Factors', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Irrigation', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Lung Transplantation', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Palliative Care', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteome', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Vision', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adjudicate', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'design', 'detector', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'insight', 'never smoking', 'new therapeutic target', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,319844
"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. Although COPD occurs predominantly in smokers, it is unknown why only a minority of smokers (~20-40%) develop chronic airflow limitation or destruction of distal airspaces (emphysema). The difference susceptibility to tobacco smoke could be explained by differences in genetics or environment, which lead to activation or repression of pathways that are important in the pathogenesis and progression of COPD. Recent advances in high throughput omics (whole genome sequencing, DNA methylation, RNA-Seq, proteomics and metabolomics) applied to NHLBI cohorts now permits a comprehensive assessment of the molecular profiles of susceptible patients. This proposal will use sparse multiple canonical correlation network analysis (SmCCNet) to integrate these existing -omics data from three NHLBI cohorts: COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS. The three independent cohorts will allow replication of specific molecular networks which can be used to target new therapies or more precise prognostic information to individuals (i.e., precision medicine). The first two of these cohorts have large numbers of African American subjects, who are underrepresented in omics studies. We will perform population specific analyses, which will allow us to determine which molecular signatures and pathways might be specific to African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth leading cause of death in the US. To help identify why only some smokers develop COPD, this proposal will integrate recently collected extensive molecular profiles from three NHLBI cohorts (COPDGene, Jackson Heart Study, and SPIROMICS) to discover molecular networks that are important in both diagnosis and progression. In addition to non- Hispanic Whites, by focusing on African Americans, which are highly underrepresented in these types of studies, we expect that there are specific molecular network differences that may lead to specific therapies (i.e., precision medicine) based on race/ethnicity.",Multi-omic networks associated with COPD progression in TOPMed Cohorts,10138019,R01HL152735,"['African American', 'Biology', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Progression', 'Distal', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Profiling', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Race', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Smoker', 'Spirometry', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tobacco smoke', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Transcript', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'alpha 1-Antitrypsin', 'base', 'chronic airflow obstruction', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'disease phenotype', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'protein metabolite', 'single molecule', 'soluble RAGE', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'unsupervised learning', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2021,759026
"Prognostic Markers of Emphysema Progression Project Summary/Abstract Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) affects up to 24 million people in the United States and is projected to be the 3rd leading cause of death worldwide by 2020 with a total cost of $50 billion. COPD has been traditionally dichotomized into the clinical phenotypes of emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but its underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In particular, emphysema is defined as abnormal, permanent dilation of the distal airspaces. The development and progression of this pathologic process are associated with a decline in lung function and progressive clinical impairment. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the chest is increasingly being leveraged to quantify the disease and its progression objectively. Current approaches to quantify emphysema progression are limited and discard most of the spatial and temporal information in CT scans obtained at inspiration and expiration. In this proposal, we plan on developing computational components to prognosticate emphysema progression that builds upon image density markers and lung mechanical strain characteristics conditioned on their underlying emphysema subtypes. This proposal leverages our previous experience in computational emphysema subtyping to discover, validate and translate a novel panel of prognostic markers tailored around the postulated mechanisms of emphysema progression: inflammation injury and mechanical strain. To reach this goals, we will (1) develop an advanced emphysema subtyping approach using novel deep learning architectures, (2) develop a fast mass preserving large displacement registration approach to enable the discovery of local elastic properties of lung tissue between inspiratory and expiration CT scans, (3) discover new subtype-specific biomarker features based on image density relations and mechanical properties using unsupervised deep learning techniques within a common statistical framework, and (4) validate the prognostic value of the proposed biomarkers and their association with decline end-points and clinical outcomes to enable its clinical interpretation and translation. In addition to that, will be explored alternative prognostic models based on advanced machine learning techniques and performed a model comparison study to define the most prognostic model for emphysema progression. Our analysis will process 12,300 scans corresponding to 5,517 subjects with baseline and follow-up data from the COPDGene cohort –one of the largest cohort in COPD containing CT images at inspiration and expiration, respiratory and genetic measurements. The proposed methodology will provide reproducible, automatic and low-cost prognostic in-vivo biomarkers of emphysema progression that may enable the discovery of new therapies and translate them into clinical practice. Project Narrative Computed tomographic assessments of emphysema progression based on emphysema subtyping and lung mechanical strain biomarkers in the COPDGene study may provide insight into its prognostication.

"Prediction of COPD Progression by PRM PROJECT ABSTRACT  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a highly prevalent and heterogeneous disorder that afflicts nearly 30 million Americans. Current disease staging and therapy is based primarily on spirometry and clinical characteristics. Due to limitations in the standard phenotyping approaches, patients with similarly staged COPD may exhibit strikingly different progression patterns. Small airways disease (SAD), a treatable but occult component of COPD, is a significant contributor to airflow obstruction manifesting early in COPD. In recent years, SAD has been has been implicated as a precursor to the irreversible destruction of lung parenchyma, i.e. emphysema. The ability to predict if and when SAD will lead to emphysema would have an immediate clinical impact on the care of COPD patients. In 2012 we reported on the Parametric Response Map (PRM) analytical technique that when applied to paired inspiratory and expiratory CT scans is capable of simultaneously visualizing and quantifying the extent of “functional” SAD (fSAD) and emphysema in a single COPD patient. Since then we have made three key advances: first, PRM-derived fSAD is predictive of spirometric decline in COPD patients and emphysema development; second, we have validated in human lung samples that PRM- derived fSAD is a measure of small airway narrowing and loss; and finally, applying techniques to capture regional variation of fSAD within the lung, we have enhanced PRM (topological PRM [tPRM]) to provide a more sensitive measure of local disease severity than what is possible with the original PRM concept. Based on our findings, we postulate that PRM, or its advanced form tPRM, has the potential to predict long-term patient progression. The goal of this proposal will be to use baseline, Year 5 and recently available Year 10 COPDGene data to determine the ability of PRM to predict disease progression through three Specific Aims: 1) Characterize PRM-derived fSAD progression patterns over a 5 and 10 year period; 2) Determine how regional differences in disease distribution, as determined by tPRM, identify regional onset of local emphysema; and 3) Apply machine learning strategies to PRM/tPRM and other clinical metrics to develop models that predict patient disease trajectories. It is our expectation that PRM metrics will identify COPD patients at risk for more rapid disease progression but that utilizing regional information and machine learning strategies will further enhance our approach. The results of such analyses could both identify patients appropriate for more intense, targeted therapy at an early disease stage and contribute to our understanding of the progression of small airways disease and emphysema in COPD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  COPD is a highly prevalent but heterogeneous disorder with rising morbidity and mortality with efforts to develop effective treatments have been hampered by an inability to predict disease progression. This study proposes to apply statistical and deep learning strategies to evaluate novel CT-based analytic techniques as predictors of disease course in a COPD patient cohort.

"Airway Tree Subtyping on Large Cohorts of CT Images for COPD Risk Project Summary / Abstract: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) defined by irreversible airflow limitation, is the 3rd leading cause of death globally and 4th in the United States. Smoking tobacco is a major extrinsic COPD risk factor, but despite six decades of declining smoking rates in many countries, the corresponding declines in COPD have been modest. Only a minority of lifetime smokers develop COPD, and up to 25% occurs in never smokers. While other factors have been linked to COPD much of the variation in COPD risk remains unexplained. In addition, personalized risk and therapies are lacking for COPD, due to a lack of reliable COPD subphenotypes. Airflow obstruction, or reduced airflow from the lungs, is determined in part by airway tree structure and lung volume, both of which can be imaged with high precision by high resolution computed tomographic (HRCT) scans. Emerging evidence by our group suggests that airway tree structure variation is common in the general population and is a major contributor to this unexplained COPD risk. By manual labeling of the airway tree structure, limited to one airway generation in just 2 of the 5 lung lobes (due to complexity of tree structure), we found that 26% of the general population has major airway branch variants that differ from the classical “textbook” structure, increase COPD risk, and have a strong and biologically plausible genetic basis. We further demonstrated that airway tree caliber variation (dysanapsis) measured on CT was a stronger predictor of COPD risk than all known risk factors including smoking. Yet there is no standardized approach to characterize the full scope airway tree variation, making the exact relationship between COPD and individual airway-structure features unclear. This proposal would apply for the first-time the power of machine learning methods to the entire airway tree structure imaged on HRCT to build logically upon prior high-impact work to discover new COPD subphenotypes for risk stratification and biological pathways of intervention. Also, we will apply sophisticated / rigorous mathematical clustering approaches to airway trees derived from over 18,000 computed tomography (CT) scans in three highly characterized NIH/NHLBI-funded cohorts – the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) Lung Study, the Subpopulations and Intermediate Outcome Measures in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Study (SPIROMICS), and the Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) Study, in addition to the Canadian Cohort of Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) – to discover and replicate novel and clinically significant airway tree subtypes and their genetic basis. The proposed study provides a transformative opportunity to define and validate normal and clinically relevant tree variation in the general population and COPD cohorts. This research would result in robust, reproducible, image based novel quantitative airway tree structure subtypes from lung CT scans, and understand their role in COPD risk, prognosis, and their underlying genetic basis to help personalize COPD risk. Project Narrative For Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD, the 4th cause of death in the USA) defined by irreversible airflow, there is emerging evidence that suggests that variation in airway tree structure is common in the general population and is a major contributor to unexplained COPD risk. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding airway tree structure subtypes from lung CT scans would advance our knowledge of disease susceptibility and improve personalized therapies, prognosis, and identify an underlying genetic basis to COPD risk. Thus, this proposal is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to fostering fundamental creative discoveries and innovative research strategies as a basis for ultimately protecting health.",Airway Tree Subtyping on Large Cohorts of CT Images for COPD Risk,10299153,R01HL155816,"['3-Dimensional', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Air Movements', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Caliber', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dictionary', 'Disease Pathway', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Resolution Computed Tomography', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Obstructive Lung Diseases', 'Occupational', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Trees', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'disorder risk', 'environmental tobacco smoke', 'follow-up', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'high standard', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lung development', 'lung lobe', 'lung volume', 'machine learning method', 'never smoker', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'pollutant', 'prognostic significance', 'pulmonary function decline', 'respiratory', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2021,681411
"Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality in the United States. COPD is a highly heterogeneous disease and some COPD therapies are only applied to specific clinically defined subtypes. With the advent of multiple high-throughput biological assays and machine learning approaches, data-driven subtypes are increasingly being recognized. We hypothesize that such subtypes exist in COPD and that they can be identified using an integrative, multi-'omic approach. To accomplish this goal, we first propose to complement existing RNA and whole genome sequencing data in the well-phenotyped COPDGene study with peripheral blood microRNA sequencing. We will study the relationship of microRNA to genetic variation and gene expression in COPD. Next, we will apply a patient-based network similarity method to these three data types to identify COPD molecular subtypes. Finally, we will associate these subtypes with important clinical phenotypes and outcomes, and validate these subtypes in an independent subset of subjects. Our analysis targets a key clinical problem in COPD management, and will allow the mentee to become an independent investigator, applying bioinformatic and machine learning methods to genomic data in respiratory diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death in the United States. Patients with COPD may have very similar lung function but differ in many other characteristics. We propose to use multiple types of biologic data to identify different COPD subtypes, which may be important for disease prognosis and treatment.",Multi-omic Subtyping of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease,10205150,K08HL136928,"['Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Expert Opinion', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Lung volume reduction surgery', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Network-based', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'RNA', 'Research Personnel', 'SNP array', 'Severities', 'Spirometry', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'United States', 'base', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'disorder subtype', 'exome', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'machine learning method', 'miRNA expression profiling', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'pulmonary function', 'quantitative imaging', 'respiratory', 'risk variant', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K08,2021,172800
"Robust Clinical Translation of CT Imaging Biomarker in COPD for EBV Patient Selection PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes conditions such as emphysema, is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Although progression of COPD can be slowed through lifestyle changes, the disease is incurable. New treatment/management options emerged recently when the FDA approved endobronchial valves (EBV) as a Breakthrough Device for the treatment of severe COPD. EBVs provide a new treatment pathway but their implantation is associated with morbidity and mortality risks. In addition, not every patient who undergoes implantation has demonstrated the expected benefits from the device. Trial data indicate that imaging data can be used to help identify patients in whom an EBV will be effective, showing specifically that effectiveness increases in patients with heterogeneous COPD with complete fissures in the targeted lobes. The EBV is officially indicated for “severe emphysema in regions of the lung that have little to no collateral ventilation,” but interpretation of these criteria is imprecise and qualitative. The goal of this proposal is to develop more unified, robust, and quantitative criteria that will more successfully identify patients that are likely to respond to EBV implantation. The three most predictive variables identified by clinical trials to date have been the degree of severity of COPD, the heterogeneity of COPD between adjacent lobes and fissure completeness, all of which can be assessed by CT imaging. However, quantification of COPD severity can be confounded by the CT acquisition and reconstruction parameter selections used in the imaging protocol. These can also affect the ability to assess fissure completeness. In addition, traditional measures of COPD severity (i.e. Emphysema score) do not distinguish lung destruction from airtrapping, which may be important in assessing whether a patient is a good candidate for an EBV. In this proposal, we will investigate methods to standardize CT imaging data that would allow for more robust quantitative image analysis and apply the resulting methods to develop a more robust criteria for patient selection for the application of EBV devices. Therefore, our Specific Aims are: (1) To develop methods for robust, quantitative CT estimates of lung density and the Fissure Integrity Score (FIS). This will involve the application of methods to account for differences in CT scanners and acquisition/reconstruction parameters as well as machine learning methods to more accurately assess lung fissure integrity; (2) To develop and test an EBV predictive model using improved measures. Using the improved estimates of lung density and FIS from aim 1, we will develop and test a predictive model that distinguishes EBV responders from non-responders; and (3) To extend the EBV Prediction Model to incorporate additional biomarkers. We will extend the EBV scoring model by investigating other biomarkers that may provide complementary information, such as distinguishing airtrapping from COPD and an assessment of lung vascularity. We evaluate the ability of this extended model to improve our ability to distinguish EBV responders from non-responders.

"Accuracy and Precision in CT Quantification of COPD Through Virtual Imaging Trials Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death. Increasing in prevalence, COPD is a major burden to patients and providers. Computed tomography (CT) can provide valuable information about the structural and functional abnormalities of the disease as demonstrated in numerous studies where quantitative CT is deployed to characterize and evaluate the treatment. For instance, the COPDGene study has recently shown the substantial role of quantitative CT in the redefinition of COPD diagnosis, and in evaluating the progression of emphysema over time. However, these biomarkers vary across different scanners, settings, and patient attributes. There is a crucial need to manage this variability by optimizing and harmonizing CT images for reliable biomarker quantifications across both current and emerging scanners. This goal is not possible through conventional methods of using physical phantoms or patient images. Physical phantoms are often oversimplified and not representative of the complex anatomy and physiology of COPD patients. Patient images are ground-truth-limited, i.e., the exact anatomy and physiology of the patient is not fully known. Further, patient-based comparisons require multiple acquisitions of the same subjects across different scanners and settings. This is not ethically possible since repeated imaging increases the absorbed radiation dose. These challenges can be overcome through the use of virtual imaging trials (VITs) where studies are performed in silico using computational models of patients and scanners. VITs can provide reliable and practical solution to the challenge of COPD imaging provided realistic models of patients and scanners. Such models are currently lacking in the context of COPD. We develop and then utilize realistic virtual imaging toolsets to systematically evaluate and optimize CT biomarkers in COPD patients across scanners, imaging parameters, and patient attributes. We develop the first library of realistic COPD patient models with diverse attributes and severities. Coupled with accurate models of different scanners, the phantoms will be used to generate sets of ground-truth-known virtual CT cases, to be disseminated to the research community and to be used to systematically evaluate the effects of current and emerging scanners, various patient attributes, and the effects of image processing algorithms (through a national challenge), on the accuracy and precision of COPD biomarkers. Further, we develop and optimize a truth-based artificial intelligence-based algorithm for COPD quantifications. We optimize the algorithm for accuracy and reproducibility, taking advantage of the ground-truth known simulated images . We then harmonize CT settings across different scanners to accurately and precisely assess COPD imaging biomarkers for both single time-point and longitudinal studies. The studies will be done for the top two image processing algorithms, identified in the challenge, as well as our developed algorithm. Through these efforts, the project will position CT as a more reliable method for improved characterization and monitoring of COPD. Narrative The project aims to systematically evaluate and optimize quantitative CT imaging biomarkers in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients, across scanner makes and models, imaging parameters, and patient attributes. This will be performed by developing and using in silico models of COPD patients and CT scanners. The project will position CT alongside other diagnostic methods to accurately and precisely characterize COPD.",Accuracy and Precision in CT Quantification of COPD Through Virtual Imaging Trials,10298963,R01HL155293,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Communities', 'Comparative Study', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Computer Models', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Densitometry', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Effectiveness', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Libraries', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Smoking', 'Spirometry', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tube', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cohort', 'disease diagnosis', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'intelligent algorithm', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiation absorbed dose', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual imaging', 'virtual patient', 'voltage']",NHLBI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,447232
"COPD SUBTYPES AND EARLY PREDICTION USING INTEGRATIVE PROBABILISTIC GRAPHICAL MODELS COPD SUBTYPING AND EARLY PREDICTION USING INTEGRATIVE PROBABILISTIC GRAPHICAL MODELS ABSTRACT One of the main obstacles in developing efficient personalized therapeutic and disease management strategies is that most common diseases are typically defined based on symptoms and clinical measurements, although they are believed to be syndromes, consisting of multiple subtypes with variable etiology. Identifying disease subtypes has thus become very important, but so far it has been met with limited success for most diseases. In asthma, a notable exception, it was the clinical characterization that led to successful subtyping; and this is now incorporated in treatment guidelines. Unsupervised machine learning approaches of single data modalities (e.g., omics, radiographic images) have not produced actionable subtypes due to instability across cohorts. Developing data integrative approaches for multi-scale data, which are becoming available for a number of diseases, is expected to lead to robust subtyping and provide mechanistic insights of disease onset and progression. This proposal focuses on developing new computational methods, based on probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), to address this unmet need; and apply them to investigate three problems of clinical importance in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which is the fourth leading cause of mortality in USA. Our underlying hypothesis is that PGMs can integrate and analyze under the same probabilistic framework heterogeneous biomedical data (omics, chest CT scan, clinical) and identify disease subtypes and their main determinants. The objectives of our proposal is to build a comprehensive computational framework for disease subclassification, identify stable COPD subtypes at the baseline and longitudinally, and build interpretable models of the disease The deliverables of this project are: (1) new integrative computational approaches for clinical subtyping from multi-scale data; (2) new predictors of COPD progression and severity; (3) new discoveries of longitudinally stable COPD subtypes; (4) new predictors of future development of COPD; (5) new omics datasets that will be invaluable to future research in the area (baseline and longitudinal). To ensure the success of the project we follow a team science approach. This multi-PI proposal builds on the ongoing efforts of our group in the area of graphical models and their applications in biomedicine; and the ongoing collaboration of the three PIs that have complementary strengths: Prof. Benos (systems medicine and machine learning), Dr. Hersh (COPD genetics and genomics) and Dr. Sciurba (clinical aspects of COPD). It is powered by the access of the investigators to three major COPD cohorts (COPDGene®, SCCOR, ECLIPSE) that contain multiple parallel deep phenotyping and omics data from thousands of patients and controls. Although in this project we focus on COPD, our methods are generally applicable to any disease, therefore our project will have a positive impact beyond the above deliverables. We believe that due to their robust nature and interpretability, PGMs will soon become the norm for multi-scale biomedical data integration and modeling, when genetic and genomic data collection will become routine prognostic and diagnostic tools in clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Understanding the etiology of complex diseases and categorizing patients from samples taken from easily accessible tissues (like blood) are two very important aspects that will lead to development of new precision medicine strategies. In this proposal, we plan to develop new computational methods and tools that will allow researchers to identify subphenotypes in any disease. We will apply these methods on three cohorts with thousands of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and our results are expected to help us understand the complexities of this disease and build predictors of future development.",COPD SUBTYPES AND EARLY PREDICTION USING INTEGRATIVE PROBABILISTIC GRAPHICAL MODELS,10206417,R01HL157879,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Asthma', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Health Care Costs', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Multiomic Data', 'Nature', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pulmonary function tests', 'Pulmonology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Stable Disease', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cellular targeting', 'chest computed tomography', 'clinical practice', 'clinical subtypes', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder subtype', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiscale data', 'peripheral blood', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized therapeutic', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'pulmonary function', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines', 'unsupervised learning', 'vector']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,739755
