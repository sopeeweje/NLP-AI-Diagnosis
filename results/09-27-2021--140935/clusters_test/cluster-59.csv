"Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment Tobacco use plays a causal role in almost 20 different types of cancer, and although smoking cessation is a cornerstone of cancer risk reduction, the vast majority of smoking quit attempts fail. Numerous conceptual models, as well as a large body of empirical evidence, underscore that affect is a potent determinant of smoking lapse. Unfortunately, very little is known about how the constellation and temporal dynamics of distinct emotions and other factors play out in real time in the real world to influence lapse risk. This lack of knowledge severely hampers both our conceptual models and our ability to optimally intervene. Thus, the overarching objectives of this research are to create a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. The proposed research directly addresses several objectives from the PAR including the influence of distinct emotions and their time course on cancer risk behaviors, whether the role of distinct emotions is altered by the presence of other emotions (e.g., “blended” emotional states), and how the influence of affective experience is modified by context. The proposed longitudinal cohort study among 300 smokers attempting to quit is guided by a conceptual framework grounded in affective science and conceptual models of self-regulation and addiction. Participants will be followed from 1 week prior to their quit date through 6 months post-quit date. They will be assessed from 1 week pre-quit date through 2 weeks post-quit date using AutoSense, geographic positioning system (GPS), and ecological momentary assessment (EMA). AutoSense, GPS, and EMA collect real time data in natural environments, communicate wirelessly with each other, and data are processed in real time on a smartphone. AutoSense detects specific behavioral and physiologic “signatures” of smoking (the primary outcome) and self regulatory capacity (an intermediate outcome; assessed using high frequency heart rate variability) in real time. GPS real time spatial tracking will be linked with spatially and temporally relevant characteristics of the environment using geographic information system (GIS) data. EMAs assess self-reported emotions, cognition, and context. Analyses utilize advanced dynamic risk prediction models and machine learning approaches to model the dynamics of real time, real world associations among distinct emotions, SRC, and lapse. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the U.S. The proposed study will yield a more detailed and comprehensive conceptual model of the role of distinct emotions in self-regulation, as well as the technical, empirical, and analytic foundation necessary to develop more effective interventions for smoking cessation and other cancer risk behaviors that can target real time, real world mechanisms. This knowledge can be utilized to reduce the public health burden of tobacco use.",Affective science and smoking cessation: Real time real world assessment,10074543,R01CA224537,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Algorithms', 'Anger', 'Behavioral', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Cognition', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Geography', 'Home environment', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Stress', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Volition', 'Wireless Technology', 'adaptive intervention', 'addiction', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer risk', 'cancer type', 'disability', 'effective intervention', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'knowledge base', 'mobile computing', 'negative affect', 'primary outcome', 'risk prediction model', 'role model', 'smoking cessation', 'success']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2021,1
"Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control 7. Project Summary/Abstract Lung cancer is the leading major cause of preventable death in the United States, and cigarette smoking is a contributor to lung cancer in 80%–90% of cases. Though adult cigarette smoking rates have declined substantially during the past 50 years, they remain as high as 30% in certain groups, such as individuals living in poverty. Quitting is difficult: a given quit attempt results in cessation in fewer than 10% of cases, and most adult cigarette smokers have attempted and failed to quit, and often many times. What is urgently needed are novel interventions for cigarette smoking cessation that operate through different mechanisms from those targeted by existing interventions, which are likely to have been unsuccessful for persistent smokers. A barrier to progress is that the mechanisms of action of most treatments are not known, which makes it difficult to know which treatment will work best for whom. We turn to affective science to identify a candidate technique that could serve as the basis for a novel intervention. Research on affect regulation typically focuses on down- regulation of affective states, such as craving for cigarettes, using effortful strategies such as cognitive reappraisal. However, a new insight in affect regulation is that people can construe, or subjectively understand, events with varying levels of abstraction, and that construing health-related behaviors in high- versus low-level terms promotes health behavior in several domains. For example, smokers who want to quit are more likely to resist a cigarette when they construe the same event (e.g., “abstinence”) in more abstract, high-level terms (e.g., “becoming a better me”) versus more concrete, low-level terms (e.g., “not smoking this cigarette”). There is some evidence that high-level construal might rely on distinct mechanisms from traditional affect regulation and smoking reduction interventions, but its mechanisms of action are unknown. Directly comparing its mechanisms to those of alternative affect regulation strategies and developing tools to induce high-level construal are the next steps on the path toward developing a novel intervention. Also, establishing individual differences in the effects of high-level construal will allow future interventions to be targeted to the individuals for whom they will be maximally effective. We identified two candidate mechanisms through which high-level construal might operate: down-regulation of craving and up-regulation of goal energization (i.e., motivation to quit). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed the neural systems engaged by those processes to be distinct. So, we will use multivariate analyses of fMRI data to quantify the similarity of high-level construal to each candidate (Aim 1). This will be done in a longitudinal translational experiment with 4 conditions—high- level construal, down-regulation of craving, up-regulation of goal energization, and treatment-as-usual—in a sample of persistent smokers in poverty, who are the most likely to benefit from a novel, theory-based treatment. The sample size (N = 240) affords an examination of individual differences in the effect of high-level construal on neural activity and craving, and the degree to which they predict smoking reduction (Aim 2). 8. Project Narrative Cigarette smoking is among the leading causes of preventable death in the United States because smoking increases risk for lung cancer and various diseases. Though U.S. smoking rates have declined, a substantial percentage of adults, particularly those living in poverty who have repeatedly tried and failed to quit, still smoke and therefore could benefit from novel interventions for cessation that operate through different mechanisms than those of traditional treatments. This study will use neuroimaging to uncover the mechanisms of action of a promising strategy for affect regulation and smoking cessation and also build profiles of individuals for whom this strategy does and does not work, thereby providing tangible and practical information that public health professionals and clinicians can use to inform personalized treatments for cigarette smoking cessation.",Construal level as a novel pathway for affect regulation and cancer control,10127602,R01CA240452,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Control', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Down-Regulation', 'Event', 'Fire - disasters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Health Promotion', 'Health behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Medial', 'Motivation', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Personality Traits', 'Persons', 'Poverty', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cigarette craving', 'cigarette smoking', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cost', 'craving', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'insight', 'lens', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'preventable death', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'smoking cessation', 'theories', 'tobacco control', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R01,2021,595543
"Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers PROJECT SUMMARY  The purpose of this study is to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms that link acute alcohol intoxication with cigarette use in young nondaily smokers (ages 21-25). Nondaily smokers experience fewer symptoms of cigarette withdrawal than daily smokers; however, they still experience difficulty quitting. Since smoking cessation before the age of 30 substantially attenuates the long-term health consequences associated with smoking, understanding the factors that motivate cigarette use in young nondaily smokers and developing tailored interventions will be critical for curbing cigarette use and improving public health. The proposed project will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine how acute alcohol intoxication impacts brain function and will assess the extent to which alcohol-induced changes in brain function correlate with impulsive choice, cigarette craving, and craving regulation in young adults. Furthermore, we will assess how alcohol-induced changes in brain function, impulsivity, craving, and capacity for craving regulation predict cigarette use over the course of 1 year.  This K01 application advances the PI's long-term research goal of establishing an independent line of research examining neurobiological markers that confer risk for future substance use disorder using multimodal neuroimaging techniques. The proposed training plan will enable the PI to develop skills and expertise in five primary areas: 1) design and implementation of longitudinal studies, 2) task-based and resting- state fMRI, 3) advanced statistical methods, 4) the assessment of acute neurobiological responses to drugs and 5) the neurobiological underpinnings of impulsive choice. The training program combines formal coursework with mentorship from experienced consultants who are experts in the proposed areas of training. This project will leverage the intellectual and institutional support at OHSU and in Dr. Nagel's Developmental Brain Imaging Laboratory in order to develop a new line of research that will form the foundation for a career as an independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although rates of cigarette use are declining, the proportion of nondaily smokers is rising, particularly among young adults. Among young adults, nondaily smoking is associated with negative health consequences and, for some, may lead to the establishment of life-long smoking patterns. The goal of this project is to understand the behavioral, psychological and neurobiological factors that contribute to cigarette use in nondaily smokers to aid the development of tailored evidence-based interventions.",Neurobiological Mechanisms Linking Acute Alcohol Intoxication to Impulsivity and Cigarette Craving in Nondaily Smokers,10125984,K01DA046649,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholic Intoxication', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Behavioral', 'Beverages', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cigarette', 'Cognitive', 'Consumption', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impulsive Behavior', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tobacco use', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Ventral Striatum', 'Withdrawal', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'alcohol effect', 'alcohol response', 'base', 'career', 'cigarette craving', 'cigarette smoking', 'craving', 'design', 'discounting', 'drinking', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow up assessment', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'problem drinker', 'psychologic', 'reduce symptoms', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'skills', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking intervention', 'statistical and machine learning', 'therapeutic target', 'young adult']",NIDA,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K01,2021,183179
"Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY Mobile technology has enormous potential for delivering highly innovative, dynamic smoking cessation interventions. Phone sensors, wearable technology, and real time data collection methods such as ecological momentary assessment (EMA) have made it possible to collect a wealth of environmental and physiological data such as location, heart rate, and mood. Environmental and situational cues such as craving and proximity to others smoking are highly predictive of lapse among those trying to quit, suggesting that lapse risk is characterized by immediate, dynamic influences. Emerging strategies such as just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI), aim to prevent smoking lapse using tailored support delivered via mobile technology in the moments when it is most needed. Although research has identified antecedents of smoking lapse based on observations from EMA data, studies have been unable to utilize the full spectrum of contextual and environmental data available with current technology. Given the importance of dynamic influences on lapse risk, there is a critical need for strategies that accurately identify moments of highest lapse risk to improve cessation interventions. Recent research has demonstrated the utility of machine learning to predict individual behavior. Machine learning is a robust data analytic strategy that can produce highly accurate predictive models from large datasets and can automatically adapt to new data in real time. The overall objective of this application is to use supervised machine learning methods to develop an automated algorithm to quantify smoking lapse risk at the individual level. Specifically, we aim: 1) to apply supervised machine learning methods to quantify personalized risk of smoking lapse, and 2) to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of delivering a personalized, just-in-time adaptive intervention driven by machine learning prediction of smoking lapse risk in real time. The proposed research and training plan will take place at The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC) and the Stephenson Cancer Center (SCC). Training will focus on increasing knowledge of machine learning methodology, and the conduct and analysis of JITAIs, which will facilitate completion of the proposed project. Results of the proposed research have the potential to reduce the amount and frequency of data needed from participants and sensors, enabling the development of less burdensome interventions. It is expected that completion of these aims will yield preliminary data to inform an automated, dynamic intervention that fully utilizes the strengths of mobile technology for measuring individual behavior and environmental context in real time. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will be among the first to use machine learning methods to predict risk of individual smoking lapse in real time. The resulting algorithm will provide a personalized model for each participant that adapts to new data and triggers the delivery of a tailored, precision intervention when it is most needed. If successful, this project and its methodology could be adapted to target other health behaviors such as diet, physical activity, or other substance use disorders.",Using Machine Learning to Develop Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions for Smoking Cessation,10294298,R00DA046564,"['Accelerometer', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Cancer Center', 'Car Phone', 'Classification', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Demographic Factors', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diet', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Effectiveness', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Health Sciences', 'Health behavior', 'Heart Rate', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Oklahoma', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social Environment', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Wrist', 'adaptive intervention', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'craving', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'secondary analysis', 'sensor', 'standard care', 'supervised learning', 'trend', 'wearable device']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R00,2021,248999
"Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers” 7. Project Summary We will test Adapt2Quit, an innovative Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational Messaging System. Adapt2Quit uses complex, machine-learning algorithms to adaptively select the best messages for a smoker, based upon multiple attributes, including: 1) the smoker’s profile; 2) the smoker’s explicit feedback over time to the system; and 3) data from thousands of prior smokers’ profiles and their feedback patterns. Adapt2Quit’s type of machine- learning is called a recommender system. Outside healthcare, companies (like Amazon) use recommender systems to continuously learn from user feedback (e.g.: liked product, products purchased) to improve, thus enhancing personal relevance and customer engagement. Engagement is a huge challenge for digital health. In the field of computer-tailored health messaging, Adapt2Quit is the first to use machine-learning to continuously adapt to feedback and select new personalized messages to send to smokers. To evaluate the impact of the recommender system, Adapt2Quit will be compared with a robust, active control, a simple but effective messaging system. In our pilot experiment, Adapt2Quit outperformed the control, especially among socio- economically disadvantaged (SED) smokers. SED smokers are harder to engage in interventions. Thus, Adapt2Quit’s increased engagement will be of particular importance for targeting SED smokers. In addition to the potential impact of the Adapt2Quit messages in inducing and engaging smokers in cessation, our goal is to increase use of the state Quitline. We will recruit 700 SED smokers at two sites. All smokers will complete a baseline interview and receive a paper brochure with information about the state’s Quitline. Smokers will then be randomized to: Adapt2Quit or the standard messaging. As the system is designed to enhance engagement, and through engagement lead to positive actions, Aim 1 will focus on engagement [Hypothesis (H1a) Among Adapt2Quit smokers, those with higher engagement levels (completed more ratings) will have greater scores on the perceived competence scale (PCS)]. Aim 2 compares (Adapt2Quit and control) behavior change processes including perceived competence for smoking cessation and cessation supporting actions (calling a Quitline) [H2a: Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater scores on the PCS than control smokers; H2b: Adapt2Quit smokers will adopt more cessation supporting actions (Quitline, NRT) than control smokers]. Aim 3 will assess effectiveness of the system [H3a: (primary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have greater smoking cessation rates (6-month point prevalence biochemically verified) than control smokers; H3b: (secondary outcome) Adapt2Quit smokers will have lower time to first quit attempt than control smokers; H3c: (mediation analysis) Measured internal and external processes will mediate the effect of Adapt2Quit on smoking cessation]. To accomplish the above aims, we have brought together a multidisciplinary team with relevant expertise, and a strong track record of collaboration. 8. Narrative We propose testing Adapt2Quit — an innovative motivational texting “recommender system.” Adapt2Quit enhances tailored motivational messaging systems using machine-learning algorithms to learn from, and adapt to, user feedback (prior and daily message ratings), thereby increasing message personal relevance. Our study will test Adapt2Quit motivational messaging texting with socioeconomically disadvantaged (SED) smokers.","Adapt2Quit – A Machine-Learning, Adaptive Motivational System: RCT for Socio-Economically Disadvantaged smokers”",10146309,R01CA240551,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Award', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Biochemical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Motivation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Pattern', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Self Determination', 'Self Efficacy', 'Site', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking and Health Research', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Time', 'active control', 'base', 'behavior change', 'design', 'digital health', 'disadvantaged population', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'evidence base', 'experimental study', 'health care settings', 'health disparity', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning progression', 'machine learning algorithm', 'multidisciplinary', 'nicotine replacement', 'primary outcome', 'quitline', 'recruit', 'rural healthcare', 'secondary outcome', 'smoking cessation', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'theories']",NCI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,644137
"Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (DESCRIPTION) Cigarette smoking accounts for 480,000 premature deaths and one third of all cancer deaths annually in the US. There is enormous need for high-impact, cost-effective population-level interventions for smoking cessation. For the past 15 years, mobile phone-delivered text messaging interventions such as the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT have been a prominent technology addressing this need. However, very much like all widely available technologies for smoking cessation (e.g., websites), text messaging interventions have modest quit rates, driven largely by low engagement. Fortunately, a new technology provides a therapeutic conversation to address the problem of engagement that impacts text messaging and other current digital technologies for smoking cessation. Advances in machine learning, natural language processing, and cloud computing are now making it possible to create and widely disseminate conversational agents (CAs), which are computer-powered digital coaches designed to form long-term social-emotional connections with users through conversations. CAs are supportive, empathic, reflectively listen, provide personalized responses, and offer goal setting and advice appropriately timed to the needs of the user. Regarding CAs for smoking cessation, the major knowledge gaps are: (1) their efficacy, (2) theoretical mechanisms, and (3) the cost-effectiveness. Also unexplored are the potential baseline moderators of CAs for smoking cessation. We recently developed a CA for smoking cessation, called “QuitBot,” evaluated it in a diary study, and then tested it in a pilot randomized controlled trial (N = 306), comparing it with the NCI’s SmokefreeTXT. The pilot RCT design was very feasible with 93% three-month follow-up. QuitBot had: (a) high participant engagement and (b) high quit rates at the three-month follow-up—very promising in comparison with SmokefreeTXT. Addressing these knowledge gaps and building on the promising results of our QuitBot research, the project will conduct a randomized controlled trial of QuitBot (n = 760) versus SmokefreeTXT (n = 760) with 12-month follow-up in order to determine whether QuitBot: (1) provides higher quit rates than SmokefreeTXT, (2) has smoking cessation outcomes significantly mediated by therapeutic alliance processes and engagement, and (3) is cost-effective vs. SmokefreeTXT. In addition, this study will explore whether these baseline factors moderate the effectiveness of QuitBot: trust, social support, and demographics (e.g., sex). This innovative project will advance the fields of research on CAs both for smoking cessation in particular and for health behavior change in general— regardless of whether the results are positive or null. Positive results could have high population-level impact and stimulate new lines of research into CA dissemination and implementation, and the adaptation of CAs for multiple subpopulations of smokers, languages, and community and medical settings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT The overall aim of this project is to determine the effectiveness of a conversational agent for smoking cessation. If successful, this intervention can be cost-effectively scaled on a population level, thereby making a high public health impact.",Full Scale Randomized Trial of an Innovative Conversational Agent for Smoking Cessation,10120658,R01CA247156,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'American', 'Antismoking', 'Car Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Cost Measures', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Empathy', 'Feeling', 'Goals', 'Health behavior change', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking Cessation Intervention', 'Social support', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Therapeutic', 'Trust', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior change', 'cigarette smoking', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'cost effectiveness', 'demographics', 'design', 'diaries', 'digital', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'new technology', 'patient engagement', 'premature', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'randomized effectiveness trial', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'sex', 'smartphone Application', 'smoking cessation', 'social', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'text messaging intervention', 'web site']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2021,730398
"Racial disparities in biomarkers, tobacco cessation, and smoking relapse in association with electronic cigarette use Project Summary Although enormous progress has been made in reducing cigarette smoking in the United States, large disparities remain across subpopulations such as racial minorities. Quitting smoking can greatly reduce the risk of disease and early death. However, African Americans (AA) are less likely to quit smoking successfully than are non-Hispanic Whites, and they are also three times more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than Whites. There is a remarkable variation in the incidence of lung cancer due to cigarette smoking among racial/ethnic groups in the United States, and African Americans have significantly greater risks than Whites at lower levels of smoking. Tobacco use landscape is changing among U.S. adults with an estimated 4.5% of adults aged 18 years and older reporting current use of electronic cigarettes (EC). Evidence suggests that e-cigarette aerosol is substantially less toxic than combustible cigarette smoking, but e-cigarette use may also post elevated risk for former smokers to relapse back to combustible cigarette smoking. Biomarker can play an important role in assessing the potential health effects of tobacco products and studies have found that AA have higher levels of serum cotinine per cigarette smoked, higher urinary amount of TNE and NNAL than Whites. However, evidence on the racial disparities of biomarker outcomes of EC use is scarce, especially whether and to what extent they are different from use of various EC devices, flavors, and transitions in EC ↔ cigarettes. The overarching goal of this study is to examine the racial disparities in biomarkers of exposure and toxicants in association with EC use by analyzing the restricted Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Wave 1-4 biomarker data. We will link the biomarker data with the PATH adult surveys to identify the between- person and within-person differences in biomarkers by use of different vaping products, flavors, and transition in EC and combustible cigarettes across different waves (Aim 1). We will further leverage machine learning algorithms to develop a composite bio (biomarker)-socio (socio-demographics) -psycho (psychosocial factors) risk index score for each racial/ethnic group to predict subsequent abstinence from cigarette smoking and relapse to cigarette smoking since these 2 outcomes represent the most meaningful transitions from a public health perspective. This study is innovative in its focus on racial disparities of biomarkers by leveraging the nationally longitudinal data, and on using machine learning algorithms to predict future smoking cessation and relapse behaviors in EC ↔ cigarette transition. Fulfillment of these aims will build a scientific base for maximizing the value of existing biospecimen collections. Findings from this R21 study are expected to inform regulatory strategies to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and set the stage for a future R01 application that will develop personalized intervention strategies that incorporate biomarker measures to reduce racial disparities in tobacco use and improve health outcomes. 1 Project Narrative The proposed study seeks to examine racial disparities in biomarkers of e-cigarette use by linking the PATH Waves 1-4 restricted biomarker data and adult survey data. The study will extend our knowledge on the heterogeneity in biomarkers of exposure and toxicants across racial and ethnic groups, including use of different vaping products, flavors, and transition between e-cigarettes and cigarettes. We will further develop a bio-socio-psycho risk index score to predict abstinence from cigarette smoking, relapse to cigarette use, and tobacco-related health outcomes using machine learning algorithms across racial and ethnic groups.","Racial disparities in biomarkers, tobacco cessation, and smoking relapse in association with electronic cigarette use",10232728,R21DA054818,"['18 year old', '4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol', 'Abstinence', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Cigarette', 'Cigarette Smoker', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Cotinine', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Ethnic group', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hispanics', 'Incidence', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of lung', 'Measures', 'Menthol', 'Metals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nicotine', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Respiratory Signs and Symptoms', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Smoke', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco Use Cessation', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'cigarette smoke', 'cigarette smoking', 'cigarette user', 'combustible cigarette', 'disorder risk', 'e-cigarette aerosols', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'former smoker', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'personalized intervention', 'psychosocial', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial disparity', 'racial minority', 'reduce tobacco use', 'smoking cessation', 'smoking relapse', 'sociodemographics', 'tobacco exposure', 'tobacco products', 'tobacco toxicant', 'toxicant', 'urinary', 'vaping']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2021,204739
