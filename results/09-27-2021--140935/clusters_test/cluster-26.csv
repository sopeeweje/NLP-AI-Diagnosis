"Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach Project Summary/Abstract Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a national and global public health emergency. Because the causative virus is novel, the present options for treatment are extremely limited, and an effective vaccine could be 1-2 years away. Thus, there is an urgent need for efficacious therapeutics against the disease. While development of new drugs is under way, that process is slow and resource-intensive. In the short- to-medium term, a superior strategy is to repurpose already existing drugs to treat the disease. Over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical effect against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, or the hyperinflammatory immune response it provokes. What is unclear is how many of these have a significant, protective effect on actual patients, as only a tiny fraction of these drugs is in clinical trials. Most of these agents are chronic medications, and thus there are millions of Americans who are already using them. The first aim of this study is to assess the degree of protection any of these drugs confers against the serious complications of COVID-19 while adjusting for known risk factors and confounders. The second aim is to search for additional interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and specific demographic and/or clinical subgroups that could be protective or harmful. The Change Healthcare Database, a part of the COVID-19 Research Database, contains up-to-date health insurance claims data for about one- third of all Americans. Using this database, this study will evaluate the impact of these drugs on the risk of four important outcomes in patients who are COVID-19-positive: need for hospitalization, use of mechanical ventilation, shock, and death. Results will be risk-adjusted for the risk factors already well established to predict poor outcomes in COVID-19. This study will further mine the data for second- and third-order interactions between drugs or combinations of drugs and different subpopulations of patients using a novel machine learning method called the Feasible Solution Algorithm (FSA). The FSA enables the researcher to uncover higher-order statistical interactions in regression models, which leads to the identification of subgroups and complexities that are not always apparent with traditional regression models. If the results show candidate drugs with highly protective effects, these can be prioritized for prospective clinical studies. Drugs that show harmful effects can be considered for discontinuation in infected or high-risk patients. Project Narrative Repurposing existing drugs to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) is a much faster and more resource-effective approach than developing new drugs de novo. This holds promise because over 100 drugs already approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have shown in vitro, in silico, or theoretical activity against SARS- CoV-2 or the immune response it provokes. Using a large health insurance claims database, we will assess the potentially protective effects of each of these drugs on patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and search for interactions between multiple drugs and specific demographic and clinical subpopulations via a novel statistical algorithm.","Identifying existing, FDA-approved drugs with clinically protective effects against coronavirus disease 2019 using a big data approach",10195454,R21LM013683,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Anticoagulants', 'Antiplatelet Drugs', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Blood Coagulation Disorders', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 treatment', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Combinations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Immune response', 'In Vitro', 'Inpatients', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Judgment', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Methods', 'Mineralocorticoid Receptor', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protective Agents', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Shock', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Vaccines', 'Virus', 'Vision', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'cyclooxygenase 1', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'demographics', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'global health emergency', 'high risk', 'human data', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insurance claims', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'off-label use', 'pandemic disease', 'patient subsets', 'preclinical study', 'prophylactic', 'prospective', 'protective effect', 'public health emergency', 'sex']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE,R21,2021,1
"Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We have recently developed novel framework for next-generation quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) designed to meet the challenges of biomolecular simulations and drug discovery applications. QMFFs have tremendous computational advantages relative to their fully QM counterparts, being inherently parallelizable and linearly scaling, offering tremendous computational speedup, and promising quantitative accuracy potentially superior to full QM methods. QMFFs accurately model multipolar electrostatics, charge penetration effects, and non-linear polarization response. QMFFs thus offer a transformative technology for drug discovery applications, in particular, for advancing the predictive capability of free energy simulations in lead reﬁnement. These are critically important for the diverse chemical space of drug molecules, including halogen bonding, cation-  and metal-ligand interactions. Further, QMFFs offer a mechanism for modeling covalent inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, we propose to: I. Develop new QMFFs for drug discovery. QMFFs will be developed based on both semiempirical and ab initio density-functional methods in the following stages: 1) determination of multipolar mapping parameters enhancing the DFTB electrostatic potential to reach greater accuracy, 2) augmentation of electronic response terms using chemical potential equalization (CPE) corrections using an orthogonal perturbation-response approach to solve the under-polarization problem of DFTB methods, 3) parameterization of non-electrostatic non-bonded interac- tion parameters using realistic potentials that capture many-body exchange and dispersion interactions, and 4) exploration of statistical potentials, using machine learning approaches applied to quantum data sets, to correct internal conformational energies and short-range interactions. II. Develop new free energy methods to enable protein-ligand binding predictions using QMFFs. We will develop a novel integrated free energy pipeline to pre- dict alchemical binding free energies for ligands and inhibitors. This will include new GPU-accelerated methods for  -space self-adaptive mixture sampling ( -SAMS) and 2D-vFEP analysis, coupled with conformational space enhanced sampling methods for alchemical steps of the thermodynamic cycle, and advancements in free en- ergy “book-ending” methods (BBQm) to efﬁciently connect molecular mechanical force ﬁeld and QMFF model representations. III. Test and validate QMFFs and free energy methods, and apply to MIF inhibitor binding. The methods will be broadly tested against established data sets for solvation free energies, and a drug discovery data set. More in-depth validation studies will be conducted by examining the relative binding free energies of inhibitors of the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF). Finally, exploratory applications will examine mechanisms, characterize transition states and predict rates for covalent inhibition for a series of MIF inhibitors. Next-generation integrated quantum force ﬁelds for biomedical applications PI: Darrin M. York, Laboratory for Biomolecular Simulation Research, Rutgers University, Piscat- away, NJ 08854-8087 USA.  We propose a novel strategy to develop a class of integrated quantum mechanical force ﬁelds (QMFFs) that create highly accurate physical models for complex biomolecular simulations. Com- bined with recently developed high-precision free energy simulation and analysis tools, the pro- posed QMFFs will overcome current critical barriers to progress for drug discovery and deliver accurate and precise predictions for drug binding afﬁnity to enhance lead optimization. The pro- posed work will be applied to understand ligand-protein binding in the macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF), and provide insight that may guide the design of new non-covalent and targeted covalent inhibitors to MIF and other systems.",Next-generation integrated quantum force fields for biomedical applications,10202634,R01GM107485,"['Affinity', 'Attention', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Books', 'Cations', 'Charge', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electrostatics', 'Free Energy', 'Halogens', 'Inflammatory', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Penetration', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem Solving', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lead optimization', 'macrophage', 'mechanical force', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'physical model', 'programs', 'quantum', 'response', 'simulation', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIGMS,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,322545
"Sex differences in the neural correlates underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution in cocaine addiction National studies show that drug use rates have increased in the last decade among women, comprising a major public health concern in the US. However, women are greatly underrepresented in neuroimaging studies, and the paucity of studies that explicitly target sex comparisons in addicted populations contributes to a gap in the study of the sex specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying drug addiction. Over the last decade, in a series of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies (conducted with previous support including R01DA023579, R01DA020949), we have thoroughly mapped the clinical symptoms of cocaine addiction to the neural networks underlying impairments in Response Inhibition and Salience Attribution (iRISA). This model proposes that the drug assumes heightened salience at the expense of non-drug related reinforcement as associated with abnormalities in reward processing and concomitant decreases in inhibitory control, together increasing addiction severity (including craving, a proxy of relapse) in susceptible individuals. The iRISA model highlights the role of the dopaminergically innervated prefrontal cortex (PFC) and its connections to mesolimbic and striatal subcortical regions as assessed functionally and structurally. However, the majority of this neuroimaging research has been accomplished in male individuals with cocaine use disorders (iCUD). In the current project we aim to expand the reach of iRISA by comparing equal numbers of male to female iCUD; to test this model’s generalizability (vs. drug specificity effects), we will also include individuals with opioid use disorder (iOUD). We will conduct functional MRI during reward processing, inhibitory control and cue-reactivity tasks, and, to inspect generalizability of results beyond task-related activations, during resting-state. Beyond functional activations and connectivity, anatomical scans will assess the underlying gray matter integrity. Across all aims, healthy controls will be included to establish norms. We hypothesize female iCUD to differ from male iCUD, or female controls, in a pattern indicative of enhanced vulnerability to iRISA inclusive of compensatory PFC activations and abnormalities in structural measures; iCUD vs. iOUD comparisons will be exploratory. The novelty of this proposal is further enhanced by an exploratory aim to compare, in a within- subjects design, menstrual cycle (and hormonal) effects and by developing sophisticated machine-learning algorithms to incorporate data from all imaging modalities to yield an automated group classification and addiction severity (including craving) prediction tool. Considering that the majority of research in addiction occurs in males, clarification of the sex differences in the neural underpinnings of iRISA could reinforce the importance of studying both genders and suggest that different treatment strategies may be effective in women (potentially of most impact when timed vis-à-vis menstrual cycle), contributing to the development of tailored (gender-based) treatment options. Including equal numbers of women and men would advance basic studies of drug addiction and ultimately save resources by minimizing cost and adverse effects in future clinical trials. National studies show that there is more rapid increase in the use of all drugs of abuse by women compared with men, comprising a unique public health concern in the US. However, an overrepresentation of males in neuroimaging studies, and a paucity of studies that explicitly target sex comparisons in addicted populations, contributes to an absence of a clear understanding of sex specific neurobiological mechanisms underlying drug addiction. The study of sex differences (and menstrual cycle/hormonal effects) in the neural underpinnings of reward processing, inhibitory control and cue-reactivity could advance basic neuroscience studies of drug addiction and save resources by minimizing cost and adverse effects during future clinical (medication) trials. Ultimately, results could contribute to the development of individually tailored (gender-based) precision medicine interventions (e.g., to reduce craving).",Sex differences in the neural correlates underlying impairments in response inhibition and salience attribution in cocaine addiction,10131173,R01DA048301,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Anatomy', 'Behavioral', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dopamine', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug usage', 'Early treatment', 'Emotional', 'Epidemic', 'Female', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Hormonal', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Intoxication', 'Luteal Phase', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Menstrual cycle', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Proxy', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recurrent disease', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Withdrawal', 'Woman', 'addiction', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'craving', 'cue reactivity', 'design', 'drug of abuse', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'men', 'neural correlate', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neurotransmission', 'non-drug', 'opioid use disorder', 'precision medicine', 'psychostimulant', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'stress reactivity', 'symptomatology', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIDA,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,689316

"Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM Project Summary/Abstract My laboratory's research is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms key to the regulation of membrane protein function and to the modulation of their output signaling. We use cryo-EM and advanced classification methods, such as manifold embedding, combined with modeling and molecular dynamics to study how ligands produce shifts in conformation equilibria and bias signaling output. We are currently studying two systems that allow us to study how different types of ligands influence the gating of ion channels. We are studying the role of lipids in triggering gating of mechanosensitive channels of the MscS family, a model system of membrane tension-sensing which can yield important information about the fundamental principles governing ion channel gating and the role that lipid-protein interactions play in this process. We have a longstanding interest in the mechanism and modulation of the ryanodine receptor (RyR), a calcium release channel fundamental to heart and skeletal function. We are using manifold embedding, a machine learning-based method to analyze cryo-EM images, to better understand how small molecules and ions such as calcium and ATP affect the conformational energy landscape of the channel. We aim to shed light on the gating mechanism of this very large ion channel, a prerequisite to understanding of its modulation by protein ligands, post-translational modifications and drugs. Our approach to these fundamental problems is to use a commbination of cryo-electron microscopy, advanced image classification techniques, modelling and molecular dynamics simulations to delineate allosteric pathways mechanistically and then test proposed models with biophysical methods such as single-channel measurements, HDX-MS and mutagenesis. Our ultimate aim is to greatly increase our molecular understanding of the gating and allosteric modulation of ion channels. Progress towards such knowledge has the potential to open the way for the design of small molecule allosteric modulators with very well controlled effects on their targets, aiding the development of drugs with limited side effects. A longer-term aim is to further develp and use our tools towards gaining a better understanding of allosteric modulation in other classes of membrane proteins of therapeutic importance. In particular, G protein-coupled receptor ligands can induce the selective binding of different transducers in a process called biased signaling. The molecular mechanisms at play in this process are still poorly understood despite their fundamental importance for the development of safer drugs. Project Narrative Ion channels are involved in a large number of vital processes, such as heart and muscle function for the ryanodine receptor and function of kidneys and regulation of blood pressure for mechanosensitive channels. This work focuses on understanding the function and regulation of ion channels. Better understanding of small ligand and lipid-protein interactions in these channels can lead more generally to a better understanding of ion channels function and to the design of drugs treating the numerous diseases associated with their malfunction.",Understanding membrane proteins’ allosteric modulation with cryo-EM,10178048,R35GM133598,"['Affect', 'Binding', 'Biological Models', 'Calcium', 'Classification', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Design', 'Family', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Ion Channel', 'Ion Channel Gating', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Membrane', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Muscle function', 'Mutagenesis', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Renal function', 'Role', 'Ryanodine Receptor Calcium Release Channel', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Transducers', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical techniques', 'blood pressure regulation', 'design', 'drug development', 'heart function', 'interest', 'molecular dynamics', 'protein function', 'side effect', 'skeletal', 'small molecule', 'therapeutic protein', 'tool']",NIGMS,ADVANCED SCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER,R35,2021,392500

"Transcriptome-driven inference of adverse drug interactions ABSTRACT Ototoxicity is a debilitating side effect of over 150 medications, many of which are prescribed as part of multi- drug regimens to treat a broad range of conditions including cancer and recalcitrant infections. Adverse drug- drug interactions (DDIs) that potentiate ototoxicity complicate the implementation of multi-drug regimens, particularly to treat multiple concurrent conditions. In most cases, DDIs are currently detected only after the drugs are on the market, so effective preclinical methods to identify potential adverse interactions would facilitate safer co-prescriptions. The astronomical number of combinations renders measuring all possible drug interactions infeasible, so predicting how ototoxic drugs interact from data of individual compounds is necessary. While the current understanding of mechanisms underlying ototoxicity of specific drug classes has helped to explain clinical observations of specific adverse ototoxicity DDIs, and aided rational design of candidate otoprotective adjuvants, this strategy cannot anticipate adverse ototoxicity DDIs or develop otoprotectants for other lesser studied drug classes and first-in-class drugs under clinical development. To survey more broadly for potential ototoxicity DDIs, we will adapt INDIGO (Inferring Drug Interactions using chemo-Genomics and Orthology), a machine learning tool that currently can predict synergy/antagonism of antimicrobial drug activity in multiple bacterial species without requiring specific drug target information. We hypothesize that we can harness the underlying approach to predict potentially adverse (synergistic) or protective (antagonistic) ototoxic DDIs in humans, by building an “INDIGO-Tox” model based on data generated from an appropriate animal system. We will measure transcriptional profiles elicited by 15 drugs known to convey ototoxicity or otoprotection, as well as corresponding pairwise ototoxicity DDI phenotypes in zebrafish, a well-established in vivo model system for studying ototoxicity. We will use these data to train INDIGO-Tox model. We will then use INDIGO-Tox to predict DDIs between 10 additional drugs, using their zebrafish transcriptome response profiles as input data. We will validate predictions in zebrafish, and will test translation of top validated predictions in a well-established mouse ex vivo model of ototoxicity. We will also use the model to generate predictions for novel genes that influence ototoxicity, which we will then test in zebrafish. Successful completion will generate hypotheses for translation into humans, facilitate model expansion to assessing possible ototoxic interactions for a broader library of drugs, and will establish a path to predict interactions between ototoxicity and other organ toxicities. N AR R AT IVE Drug-induced hearing injury is a debilitating, often irreversible side-effect of certain lifesaving medicines that are often prescribed as part of multi-drug regimens. As adverse drug-drug interactions can exacerbate ototoxicity, novel effective preclinical methods to identify potential interactions would facilitate safer co- prescriptions. Here we propose to develop and validate a computational tool, INDIGO-Tox, to predict ototoxic drug-drug interactions and identify genes that influence these interactions.",Transcriptome-driven inference of adverse drug interactions,9880239,R21DC018341,"['Adjuvant', 'Affect', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Models', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cell physiology', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Hair Cells', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injury', 'Labyrinth', 'Larva', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Regimen', 'Sampling', 'Stains', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Zebrafish', 'antimicrobial drug', 'base', 'clinical development', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'design', 'human model', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'knock-down', 'lateral line', 'loss of function', 'model building', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'otoprotectant', 'ototoxicity', 'pre-clinical', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'side effect', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIDCD,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,186000
"Development of a metabolomics and machine learning based high-throughput screening platform for data-driven drug discovery Project Summary High-throughput omics technologies allow for measuring various biomolecules comprehensively and over the past decade have become exponentially less expensive. Coupling these emerging technologies with automation approaches and the phenotypic-based drug discovery paradigm allows for data-driven drug discovery (D4). D4 focuses on a complete cellular readout, quantitatively measuring 100s to 100,000s of biomolecules or cellular features, rather than focusing on a single protein, pathway, or physiological trait. The complexity of this data requires computational tools for proper analysis and interpretation. In Phase I of this proposal, we combined the dual strengths of experts in LC-MS/MS based metabolomics (Omix Technologies) with leaders in metabolomics data analysis (Sinopia Biosciences) to develop a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform. We screened ~250 FDA approved small molecules from a broad range of drug classes on two cell lines. This dataset was compared to a matching dataset from the pioneering project for D4, the Connectivity Map, which is a transcriptomics screening and query platform for drug characterization, discovery, and repositioning. In Phase I, we observed that from both a technical and biological utility standpoint, the metabolomics data provided an orthogonal dataset with signal fidelity, sensitivity, and relevance to compound properties comparable to or exceeding the Connectivity Map. Further, we saw high concordance of plasma metabolite changes in type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis patients with in vitro metabolite changes of related drugs used for those indications. Thus, these results suggest that a metabolomics based high-throughput screening platform is not only viable as a complementary dataset to the Connectivity Map, but that metabolomics data can even play a primary role in drug discovery. In this Phase II proposal, we will focus on profiling chemical and genetic perturbations in vitro to further demonstrate the power of the platform and identify commercial opportunities for treating genetically defined rare diseases. We will expand data generation to ~3300 bioactive compounds across three cell lines. Further, we will profile 50 genetic knockouts on those three cell lines to model in vitro the associated rare diseases. Using Sinopia’s platform, we will select compounds for follow-up evaluation to identify candidates that correct for metabolic dysregulations seen in those rare diseases. Successful in vitro programs will aid in seeding of an early stage discovery pipeline that will be advanced through funding by private investment, patient advocacy groups, and additional federal grants. Project Narrative Data-driven drug discovery provides the potential to accelerate drug development timelines, decrease costs, and ultimately provide better care to patients. Combining Sinopia Bioscience’s and Omix Technologies strengths in high-throughput data generation and analysis, we have built a unique platform focused on understanding the use of metabolomics in drug discovery.

"Imaging the healing of ocular injury caused by vesicants to identify new therapies Chemical warfare and the use of mustard gas on civilian population poses a major risk. Vesicating agents, such as mustard gas, cause severe damage to the corneas that can result in blindness and severe loss of sight. There are currently limited therapeutic options for treatment of damage caused by vesicating agents. To enable the rapid development of much needed medical countermeasures, the proposed work will test the possibility of drug repurposing. Drug repurposing strategies are based on the identification of new uses for existing drugs. Drug repurposing is a demonstrated successful strategy that can lower the cost of drug development and reduce development time. The key challenge in drug repurposing is the need to identify novel drug-disease relationships. To address this challenge we will deploy a set of innovative microscopy approaches that will provide rich data on the subtle aspects of the impact existing drugs have on corneal healing from chemical injury. Specifically, in Aim #1 we will perform a chemical screen of 770 existing drugs using live, organ culture, image-based assay. Mice corneas will be imaged for 48 hours after wound and sophisticated computer vision algorithm will be used to extract data on stem cell proliferation, cell death, cell migration, and wound closure. In Aim #2 we will construct spatiotemporal cornea-specific cell atlas of migration, proliferation, inflammatory signaling and gene expression response to chemical injury for controls, and drug-treated corneas. The cell atlases will provide a key resource on the process of chemical injury, the mechanism of action of existing therapies, and the mechanism of action of the most promising new drugs identified in Aim #1. Collectively, the results of this work will exploit the possibility of drug repurposing for the treatment of ocular injury caused by vesicants. The resource we will generate, i.e .the information on existing drugs and the detailed cell atlases of the process of healing will build the foundation for the rapid future development of much needed medical countermeasures. Chemical weapons such as mustard gas can cause severe damage to the eye and lead to blindness. Here we will use sophisticated microscopy tools to test how does the eye heal when treating by existing FDA approved drugs and generate an atlas of the cellular response to chemical injury. Our results will support efforts to repurpose existing drugs to provide much needed medical countermeasures to combat chemical warfare.",Imaging the healing of ocular injury caused by vesicants to identify new therapies,10137251,R21EY031283,"['Accidents', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blindness', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chemical Agents', 'Chemical Injury', 'Chemical Warfare', 'Chemical Weapons', 'Chemicals', 'Chronic', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Cornea', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dexamethasone', 'Disease', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug usage', 'End Point Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Injuries', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Industrialization', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Maps', 'Mechlorethamine', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Mustard Gas', 'Organ', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Poison', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporter', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Type I Epithelial Receptor Cell', 'Vesicants', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'cell motility', 'cell type', 'combat', 'corneal epithelial wound healing', 'corneal regeneration', 'drug development', 'drug repurposing', 'first responder', 'healing', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'medical countermeasure', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'response', 'response to injury', 'screening', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cell proliferation', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment effect', 'wound', 'wound closure', 'wound healing']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2021,218032
"Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs SUMMARY- OVERALL COMPONENT We will establish a Center for Cancer Systems Pharmacology (CSP Center) that constructs and applies network-level computational models to understand mechanisms of drug response, resistance and toxicity for targeted small molecule drugs and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). We hypothesize that improved understanding of fundamental cell signaling pathways and interactions between cancer and immune cells will result in greater efficacy while minimizing toxicity. Intrinsic and acquired drug resistance pose the primary challenges to broader application of all cancer therapies. By systematically dissecting how resistance to targeted therapies and ICIs arises, we aim to understand and overcome resistance mechanisms using new drugs or drug combinations, while simultaneously predicting and balancing potential toxicities. These goals will be accomplished by translating findings from the bedside to the bench and then back to the bedside focusing on melanoma, a type of cancer in which both ICIs and targeted drugs are effective, and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and brain cancers (GBM) for which ICIs are not approved but where sporadic responses have been observed. We will develop, validate and apply innovative pharmacological concepts and instantiate these in practical form using computational models. Such models will explicitly consider the impact of mutations, phenotypic variability, cell-to-cell interaction and the composition of the tumor microenvironment in mechanisms of action of sequential or simultaneous combinations of targeted drugs and ICIs. Hypothesis generation will focus on deep phenotyping of patient-derived specimens followed by hypothesis testing in pre- clinical settings using complementary multi-omic and computational methods. We will also create and distribute new measurement and software methods to promote systems pharmacology in other areas of cancer biology. Aim 1 will establish an Administrative Core to oversee and coordinate all center activities. Aim 2 will establish a Systems Pharmacology Core to coordinate experimental and computational resources for proteomic, transcriptomic, metabolomic and imaging assays across all three Projects. Aim 3 will establish an Outreach core that promotes training via a website and seminars and ensures curation and distribution of Center data according to FAIR standards. Aim 4 (Project 1) will develop multi-scale computational models of adaptive drug resistance in melanoma that capture and ultimately explain the wide diversity of changes in cell states associated with resistance to RAF/MEK inhibitors. Aim 5 (Project 2) will measure and model the tumor microenvironment before and during treatment, and at the time of drug resistance using a range of innovative, highly-multiplexed assays for malignant and non-malignant cells. Aim 6 (Project 3) will measure and model cell type-specific metabolic, signaling, and transcriptional mechanisms that contribute to the efficacy of ICI combinations, in order to develop improved therapeutic strategies for patients unresponsive to monotherapy. NARRATIVE Targeted drugs and, more recently, therapeutic antibodies that inhibit immune checkpoint regulators to augment the body’s own defenses against cancer, are among the most promising approaches to treating cancer. However, the majority of cancer patients derive no long-term benefit from such drugs and even those who do may suffer from serious adverse effects. Systematic study of therapeutic and adverse drug responses using diverse experimental technologies and the latest data science and machine learning methods is essential for bringing about the next wave of precision cancer medicine.",Systems Pharmacology of Therapeutic and Adverse Responses to ImmuneCheckpoint and Small Molecule Drugs,10114985,U54CA225088,"['Achievement', 'Adverse effects', 'Animal Model', 'Archives', 'Area', 'BRAF gene', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Ecosystem', 'Education and Outreach', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Study', 'Lead', 'Logic', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of brain', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Newsletter', 'Non-Malignant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Proteomics', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Software Tools', 'Specimen', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Therapeutic antibodies', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Translating', 'acquired drug resistance', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical research site', 'computing resources', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'effector T cell', 'imaging modality', 'immune checkpoint', 'improved', 'inhibiting antibody', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'melanoma', 'metabolomics', 'mouse model', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'mutant', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'outreach', 'pre-clinical', 'precision oncology', 'resistance mechanism', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'small molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy resistant', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response', 'triple-negative invasive breast carcinoma', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor-immune system interactions', 'web site']",NCI,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,U54,2021,2032638
"Clinical trial emulation to assess drug safety in pregnant patients ABSTRACT Pregnant people are a vulnerable population: healthcare professionals must exercise caution in prescribing many common pharmaceuticals to expectant patients, given potential risk of injury to a developing fetus. Arguably, teratogenicity is the most serious manifestation of fetal toxicity, as teratogens lead to fetal malformation and are implicated in physical and mental disabilities throughout the life course of an affected child. Consideration of teratogenicity, however, is a largely nonsystematic process. While regulatory agencies like the United States Food and Drug Administration have established discrete teratogenicity scores for evaluating drug safety, these classification criteria provide little concrete distinction among score classes, making it difficult for pharmaceutical scientists to systematically determine the teratogenic potential of a drug. This effect ripples to the bedside, as providers lack robust data on most drugs to inform their judgements of safety, efficacy, and risk in recommending therapies to expectant patients. Consequently, treatment of many diseases during pregnancy remains understudied and uncertain, for fear of causing harm. To address these shortcomings and improve quality of care for pregnant patients and their unborn children, we propose the development of a holistic, generalizable framework for the identification of teratogenic drug exposures via a new paradigm of clinical pharmacovigilance. Therefore, given our inability to evaluate drug safety in pregnant patients in real time, the objective of our investigation is to develop an observational platform to uncover new drug safety information through strategic, associative analysis of medication history within the electronic health record (EHR) of a pregnant patient and developmental diseases within the EHRs of their neonates. This approach will harness 48,434 linked maternal and neonatal EHRs within the Research Derivative, a databank of identified EHRs at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, across which we plan to apply and appropriately validate a medication-wide association study to uncover new, data-driven associations between maternal medication exposures and teratogenic health outcomes. To date, we have employed this technique to discover 129 associations between maternal drug exposure and neurodevelopmental diseases from existing primary care data, which recapitulate teratogens well-known to clinical practice that also serve as positive controls for our model. Now, we hope to expand our platform to encompass more advanced techniques of clinical trial emulation; if successful, we anticipate that discovering new toxicants through retrospective data modeling will greatly enhance our goal of systematically clarifying cases of suspect drug safety in pregnancy. In the long run, we hope this approach will allow clinicians to embrace a more accurate knowledge base in their evaluation of the risks and benefits in prescribing drugs with unclear teratogenic risks to their pregnant patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE From the perspective of regulatory agencies for public health and safety, it is unethical to perform clinical trials on pregnant people to assess drug safety and efficacy for the treatment of diseases of pregnancy; paradoxically, while this policy recognizes the vulnerability of an expectant mother and her unborn child, it has created a public health emergency for millions of pregnant patients, as clinicians lack robust data on treatments for these conditions and still do not know whether many common drugs are safe to prescribe to their pregnant patients. To address these problems, this project aims to harness the burgeoning science of machine learning to create a surrogate for randomized, controlled drug trials in pregnant populations, via the development of a “target trial” platform to discover new drug safety and efficacy insights from medication and disease data in linked maternal and neonatal electronic health records that were originally collected during routine medical care. Upon completion of this project, pharmaceutical scientists may employ the resulting target trial framework to clarify drug safety concerns for pregnant patients, and clinicians may benefit more definitive data in their choice of safe and effective medications for expectant mothers.",Clinical trial emulation to assess drug safety in pregnant patients,10232840,R21HD105304,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Birth', 'Breathing', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disasters', 'Disease', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Ethics', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based practice', 'Exercise', 'Fetal Development', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Health system', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Infant Care', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neonatal', 'Newborn Infant', 'Orphan', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Primary Health Care', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teratogens', 'Testing', 'Thalidomide', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Upper Extremity', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data modeling', 'data repository', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental study', 'fetal', 'human data', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vitro Model', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'loss of function', 'malformation', 'medication safety', 'neonate', 'novel therapeutics', 'pharmacovigilance', 'phenome', 'point of care', 'preclinical study', 'pregnant', 'prevent', 'public health emergency', 'response', 'simulation', 'toxicant', 'unborn child', 'unethical']",NICHD,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2021,259500
"Computational prediction of gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism Project Summary / Abstract Notwithstanding pre-clinical experiments and clinical trials performed to identify efficacy, side effects, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs), only 25-60% of patients respond favorably to prescribed drugs, leading to a cost of $30-$130 billion in the US annually. ADRs are partially attributed to the gut microbiome, i.e. the complex and dynamic community of microorganisms residing in gastrointestinal tract. The gut microbiome interacts with different types of xenobiotics including drugs, resulting in biotransformation of therapeutics into metabolites with altered disposition, efficacy, and toxicity. Gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism leads to non-effective treatments as well as teratogenic, toxic, and lethal effects that in some cases were not recognized until the drug was on the market. As a result, leading pharmaceutical researchers have begun to recognize that the role of gut microbiome in drug metabolism should be accounted for in attempts to improve treatment effectiveness. However, despite extensive progress in gut microbiome research, there is currently no reliable, cost-effective approach to integrate gut-mediated drug metabolism in drug development pipelines. This Phase I proposal aims to address this challenge by developing a new computational platform with the ability to predict microbial metabolism of therapeutic drugs and to leverage that information to enhance drug design and development. We will employ a range of state-of-the-art computational biology techniques to reliably screen for microorganisms that may metabolize the target drugs. The novelty of this project lies in the ability to screen drug-metabolizing enzymes/microorganisms using multiple metrics and methods to increase the reliability of predictions to achieve the accuracy necessary for clinical and commercial use. This multi- method platform will be built, integrated, and validated in an iterative fashion using targeted in vitro experiments on two candidate drugs, i.e. the anti-arrhythmic drug amiodarone and the anti-viral drug famciclovir. This project is designed to both advance our current understanding of microbiome function in the context of drug-gut interactions as well as inform strategies to help enhance public health and economic growth. The value proposition of this project includes leveraging publicly available bioinformatics databases as well as advances in computational biology techniques to develop a more precise, reliable, and inexpensive tool for gut microbiome-mediated metabolism of therapeutic drugs. This in-silico platform could be employed for both current drugs as well as drugs under development. For current drugs, this platform can help increase the safety of drugs by predicting the mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity as they may differ from individual-to- individual. For new drugs, the platform would reduce the cost and timeframe of drug development, while increasing the effectiveness of the therapeutics themselves.

"Enabling the Accelerated Discovery of Novel Chemical Probes by Integration of Crystallographic, Computational, and Synthetic Chemistry Approaches ABSTRACT Identification of high-quality chemical probes, molecules with high specificity and selectivity against macromolecules, is of critical interest to drug discovery. Although millions of compounds have been screened against thousands of protein targets, small-molecule probes are currently available for only 4% of the human proteome. Thus, more efficient approaches are required to accelerate the development of novel, target-specific probes. In 2019, a new bold initiative called “Target 2035” was launched with the goal of “creating […] chemical probes, and/or functional antibodies for the entire proteome” by 2035. In support of this ambitious initiative, we propose to develop and test a novel integrative AI-driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against any target protein. Here, we will build an integrative workflow where the unique XChem database of experimental crystallographic information describing the pose and nature of chemical fragments binding to the target protein will be used in several innovative computational approaches to predict the structure of organic molecules with high affinity towards specific targets. The candidate molecules will be experimentally validated and then optimized, using computational algorithms, into lead molecules to seed chemical probe development. The proposed project is structured around three following interrelated keystones: (i) Develop a novel method for ligand-binding hot-spot identification and discovery of novel chemical probe candidates; (ii) Develop novel fragment-based integrative computational approach for accelerated de novo design of chemical probes; (iii) Consensus prediction of target-specific ligands, synthesis, and experimental validation of computational hits.  More specifically, we will develop a hybrid method to predict structures of high-affinity ligands for proteins for which XChem fragment screens have been completed. These approaches will be used for screening of ultra- large (>10 billion) chemical libraries to identify putative high affinity ligands within crystallographically determined pockets. Then, we will develop and employ an approach using graph convolutional neural networks for de novo design of a library of strong binders that will be evaluated to select the best candidates for chemical optimization. Finally, we will combine traditional structure-based and novel approaches, developed in this project to select consensus hit compounds against three target proteins: transcription factor brachyury, hydrolase NUDT5, and bromodomain BAZ2B. Iterative design guided by the computational algorithms, synthesis, and testing will progressively optimize molecules to micromolar leads to chemical probes for the target proteins.  Completion of the proposed aims will deliver a robust integrative workflow to identify leads for chemical probes against diverse target proteins. We expect that our AI-based computational approach to convert crystallographically-determined chemical fragments into lead compounds coupled with the experimental validation of computational algorithms will accelerate the discovery of new chemical probes, expand the druggable proteome, and support future drug discovery studies PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is devoted to the development of a novel integrative, structure-based, artificial intelligence driven methodology for rapid chemical probe discovery against any target protein.

"Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, having eclipsed motor vehicle-related deaths in 2008. A number of interventions have emerged in the last decade in response to this epidemic, including prescription drug monitoring programs; improving linkages to drug treatment; training drug users and those around them to recognize and respond appropriately to overdose; and, most recently, training and equipping law enforcement officers to use naloxone (an opioid antagonist) at the scene of an overdose. Equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone is intended to capitalize on the fact that officers often arrive at an overdose scene before other emergency services, particularly in rural areas, and until now have not been well equipped to deal with overdose events. In the last 5 years, with the active encouragement of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Department of Justice, law enforcement agencies in at least 28 states are planning to or have begun carrying naloxone to use when they attend overdoses. Despite the proliferation of such programs, this intervention is completely unstudied. In 2014 the San Diego Sheriff's Department began training patrol officers to use naloxone to respond to overdose prior to arrival of other emergency services, and to actively refer overdose victims to a collaborating drug treatment agency after revival. Uptake of drug treatment has been higher than expected (3 of 9 revivals in the 6 month pilot phase of the project entered treatment). We hypothesize that the moments after an overdose represent a ""teachable moment"" in which drug users may be more motivated to enter treatment. In addition, we hypothesize that having law enforcement officers respond to overdose as a medical emergency rather than as a crime scene may make drug users more willing to call 911 when someone overdoses. The overarching goal of this study is to determine the impact of law enforcement use of naloxone to respond to drug overdoses on two primary outcomes: (1) uptake of drug treatment referrals by overdose victims referred by law enforcement officers, and (2) rates of calling 911 to summon emergency medical services by drug users who witness overdoses. We will achieve these aims through a mixed methods study that includes secondary analysis of data available through our partnership with SDSD, their drug treatment partners the McAlister Institute, and the County of San Diego, including 911 dispatch data, SDSD case records, and treatment data. To complement these data we will conduct qualitative interviews with a community-recruited sample of drug users, to assess their perspectives around treatment referrals provided by SDSD Deputies, and their willingness to call 911 in the event of witnessed overdoses. Interviews and analysis will utilize methods drawn from grounded theory and ethnographic decision tree modeling (a rigorous qualitative method used to describe how individuals and organizations make decisions in given situations). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-related overdose deaths are now the largest cause of injury death in the United States, with more people dying of overdose than in motor vehicles. One recent response to such deaths is equipping law enforcement officers with naloxone (an overdose antidote which can be sprayed into an overdose victim's nose), and training them to refer overdose victims to drug treatment once they are revived. This study will look at the use of naloxone by the San Diego Sheriff's Department, and will be the first research project in the world to investigate whether or not having law enforcement officers refer drug users to treatment immediately after an overdose is effective, and whether or not having law enforcement officers respond to an overdose as a medical emergency rather than a law enforcement issue makes drug users more likely to call 911 when someone overdoses.",Impacts of a Novel law-enforcement delivered intervention on drug user health,10092137,R01DA040648,"['911 call', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Antidotes', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Drug Controls', 'Drug user', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency medical service', 'Epidemic', 'Ethnography', 'Evaluation Research', 'Event', 'Fatality rate', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Justice', 'Law Enforcement', 'Law Enforcement Officers', 'Lawyers', 'Life', 'Medical', 'Medical emergency', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor Vehicles', 'Naloxone', 'Natural experiment', 'Nose', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Antagonist', 'Organizational Decision Making', 'Overdose', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Police', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Statutes and Laws', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'base', 'design', 'empowered', 'first responder', 'health goals', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid overdose', 'overdose death', 'peer', 'prescription monitoring program', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'rural area', 'secondary analysis', 'side effect', 'theories', 'uptake', 'willingness']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,460884
"Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to develop a suite of software modules to enable scientists to unambiguously represent chemical mixtures in standard machine-readable formats, filling an urgent and widely-recognized need. Chemicals are typically formulated as mixtures. Recording and communicating infor- mation about chemical mixtures is essential for scientists and support staff in the pharmaceutical industry, in academia, in non-profit research organizations, in government, at specialty chemical vendors, and at commer- cial manufacturers to: • discover, develop, formulate, manufacture and regulate drugs; • manage reagent inventories; comply with laboratory safety requirements; inform first responders; • describe and reproduce biomedical experiments; and • assess and disseminate information about toxicity risks of chemical reagents and consumer products.  A working committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) is close to for- malizing “Mixtures InChI” (or MInChI), which will extend the International Chemical Identifier (InChI) to be- come the first standard to encompass mixtures. MInChI will effectively index mixtures in the same way that InChI indexes individual compounds.  In Phase 1 CDD developed the data structures and software necessary to enable adoption and utilization of MInChI and create the first general-purpose system for recording information about chemical mixtures that is computable and interoperable. In Phase 2 CDD will continue to develop a sophisticated automated transla- tion tool that will accurately convert legacy catalogs of chemical mixtures from plaintext descriptions or ad hoc formats so that they are properly represented in a machine readable format that can in turn be easily rendered into MInChI identifiers. The broad vision is to help industry to overcome the barriers to adoption so that ma- chine readable mixture descriptions can quickly deliver benefits for drug discovery, chemical safety, and toxi- cology. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to efficiently and accu- rately document the composition of chemical mixtures in a format that computers can easily interpret, process, and exchange. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. It will also help to advance our understanding of the toxicol- ogy of mixtures (which often differs from the toxicology of individual components) and improve laboratory safety both in industry and in educational settings. !",Digital representation of chemical mixtures to aid drug discovery and formulation,10074602,R44TR002528,"['Academia', 'Adoption', 'Ally', 'Books', 'Catalogs', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Commercial Catalogs', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Industry', 'Elements', 'English Language', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Readability', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Shorthand', 'Solvents', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Toxicology', 'Traction', 'Translations', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'cofactor', 'computerized tools', 'consumer product', 'cost', 'data structure', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'first responder', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'male', 'medical specialties', 'member', 'natural language', 'novel', 'open source', 'quality assurance', 'tool']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2021,750747
"Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a major disease multiplier in patients aged 65+. CKD is characterized by progressive renal fibrosis mediated through supraphysiologic type IV collagen deposition by renal myofibroblasts. As the US population continues to age, it becomes increasingly critical to identify new therapeutic strategies for CKD. Mouse models of kidney injury suggest reducing the activity of the receptor tyrosine kinase discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) is protective against fibrotic renal disease. Inhibition of DDR1 kinase reduces mesangial cell deposition of type IV collagen. To develop targeted therapeutics for CKD, the laboratory of Jens Meiler (sponsor of this application) partners with the laboratories of Ambra Pozzi (co- sponsor of this application) and Craig Lindsley to create a comprehensive DDR1 kinase inhibitor discovery pipeline. The Meiler laboratory utilizes a combination of ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling for virtual high-throughput screening (vHTS) and subsequent protein-ligand docking to identify lead compounds for synthesis/derivatization (Lindsley) and biochemical/functional evaluation (Pozzi). Selective targeting of individual kinases remains a significant challenge, and current methods in vHTS fail to account for protein binding pocket features contributing to binding selectivity. The central objectives of this proposal are to identify novel DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD and to develop new technologies to address current limitations in vHTS. In Specific Aim I, I will generate and use QSAR models to perform vHTS for potential DDR1 inhibitors. I will subsequently define a structural model of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity using molecular dynamics (MD)-generated conformational ensembles of DDR kinases in conjunction with ROSETTA flexible docking. I will also perform in silico and in vitro site-directed mutagenesis to further characterize the determinants of DDR1 kinase inhibitor selectivity. In Specific Aim II, I will develop a multitasking machine algorithm within the Meiler lab BIOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY LIBRARY (BCL) which will leverage protein structural information in addition to conventional ligand-based descriptors to improve vHTS for selective DDR1 kinase inhibitors. The methods developed will address long-standing shortcomings in the field of computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) – namely, that protein structure-based methods are computationally prohibitive for vHTS while ligand-based methods do not include direct information on binding mode. As the methods developed in Aim II become available, they will be integrated in the discovery cycle described in Aim I to ultimately define a structural model of DDR1 kinase selectivity and identify novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of CKD through the use of new and established methods. Furthermore, novel computational methods established in these studies will be broadly applicable to other challenging targets in drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is an irreversible condition associated with significantly elevated re- hospitalization and mortality rates in patients aged 65+ in the United States. Selective DDR1 kinase inhibition is a potential therapeutic target for CKD, but the current lack of structural models for DDR1-selective inhibition and limitations in computer-aided drug discovery (CADD) tools make screening for selective lead compounds challenging. We will develop new CADD methodologies to address these deficiencies, and through collaboration apply state-of-the-art ligand- and structure-based CADD methods to design DDR1-selective inhibitors for the treatment of CKD.",Targeting receptor tyrosine kinases with novel methods in computer-aided drug discovery for the treatment of fibrotic renal disease,10197115,F30DK118774,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Cell model', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collagen', 'Collagen Type IV', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DDR2 gene', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Docking', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Fibrosis', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Learning Module', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Myofibroblast', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Proteins', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'United States', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'discoidin domain receptor 1', 'discoidin domain receptor 2', 'discoidin receptor', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'global health', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo Model', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'kidney fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mesangial cell', 'molecular dynamics', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'multi-task learning', 'multitask', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'protein structure', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual model']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F30,2021,51036
"Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines Project Abstract  The protection of human health depends on the continued discovery of biologically active compounds and their development into useful pharmaceuticals. Historically, synthetic chemistry has enabled medicinal chemists to create and optimize novel lead compounds and has empowered process chemists to produce compounds at the scale necessary for the treatment of a population. The processes of drug discovery and drug production are undergoing a dramatic change with the development of efficient enzyme catalysts as practical tools for synthesis. Medicinal chemists are now harnessing the promiscuous activities of enzymes to access in a single step medicinally relevant compounds that otherwise require multiple-step chemical syntheses. Further, process chemists are starting to leverage the unrivalled efficiency and inherent sustain- ability of enzymes to replace the expensive catalysts and the toxic reagents and solvents that characterize many current production routes. As a result, enzymes are rapidly becoming important tools for pharmaceu- tical synthesis.  These transformative developments are unfortunately limited by the relative dearth of useful synthetic reactions in the ‘biocatalytic toolbox’. Our group has made fundamental advances to expanding this toolbox by using directed evolution to obtain new, useful biocatalysts starting from enzymes whose activities may have been low or even undetectable for the desired substrate or reaction.  This proposal seeks to expand and generalize a powerful biocatalytic platform for the synthesis of chiral amines. Such compounds are prevalent as building blocks for pharmaceuticals that encompass all realms of human health such as antibacterial, antifungal, and anticancer drugs. The ability to improve upon these compounds is dependent on access to suitable building blocks. We have identified the enzyme TrpB as a unique biocatalyst for the synthesis of chiral amines. This enzyme mediates a bond-forming reaction be- tween two substrates, one nucleophilic and one electrophilic. Previous work has almost exclusively focused on the activity of this enzyme with diverse nucleophilic substrates, for which TrpB has modest promiscuity. The research proposed here, by contrast, aims to expand the electrophilic substrate scope of the enzyme to make highly functionalized α-amino acids, as well as other classes of chiral amine such as amino alcohols and β-amino acids. The result of this research will be a new suite of biocatalysts that can be used to syn- thesize a wide range of chiral amine building blocks for the novel medicinal compounds essential for ad- vancing the diagnosis and treatment of human diseases. Project Narrative  The naturally occurring enzyme TrpB will be engineered to synthesize amino acids and chiral amines, which are ubiquitous precursors for bioactive compounds, both natural and synthetic. The results of this pro- ject will allow chemists and biologists direct access to these useful medicinal building blocks using a simple, efficient, and sustainable biocatalytic platform.",Development of a Biocatalytic Platform for Convergent Synthesis of Chiral Amines,10141255,R01GM125887,"['Acrylates', 'Active Sites', 'Address', 'Aldehyde-Lyases', 'Amines', 'Amino Acids', 'Amino Alcohols', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Carbon', 'Complex', 'Dehydration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Health', 'Homoserine', 'Human', 'Indoles', 'Industry', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Nature', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physical condensation', 'Population', 'Process', 'Production', 'Propanolamines', 'Property', 'Protein Engineering', 'Pyridoxal Phosphate', 'Reaction', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Route', 'Solvents', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Threonine', 'Transaminases', 'Tryptophan Synthase', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'carboxylate', 'catalyst', 'chemical synthesis', 'cofactor', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'drug production', 'empowered', 'enzyme activity', 'human disease', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel lead compound', 'serine containing aminolipid', 'serinol', 'success', 'thermostability', 'tool']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,291940
"Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID) PROJECT SUMMARY Small molecules are one of the most important classes of therapeutics alleviating suffering and in many cases death for hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Small molecules also serve as invaluable tools to study biology, often with the goal to validate novel targets for the development of future therapeutic drugs. Reproducibility of experimental results and the interoperability and reusability of resulting datasets depend on accurate descriptions of associated research objects, and most critically on correct representations of small molecules that are tested in biological assays. For example, it is not possible to develop predictive models of protein target - small molecule interactions if their chemical structure representations are not correct. Many factors contribute to errors in reported chemical structures in small molecule screening and omics reference databases, scientific publications, and many other web-based resources and documents. Because of the complexity of representing small molecules chemical structure graphs and the lack of thorough curation, errors are frequently introduced by non-experts and error propagation across different digital research assets is a pervasive problem. To address this challenging problem via a scalable approach, we propose the Automated Molecular Identity Disambiguator (AutoMID). AutoMID will be usable in batch mode at scale via an API, for example to assist chemical structure standardization and registration by maintainers of digital research assets, and also via interactive (UI) mode for everyday researchers to quickly and easily validate or correct their small molecule representations. AutoMID will leverage extensive highly standardized linked databases of chemical structures and associated information including names, synonyms, biological activity and physical properties and their sources / provenance and leverage expert rules and AI to enable reliable disambiguation of chemical structure identities at scale. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small molecules are one of the most important types of drugs. They also serve as invaluable tools to study biology.

"Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types  This proposal outlines the protocols and techniques I will be using to optimize drug discovery of ASCT2, a promising target for anti-cancer therapeutics. ASCT2 plays a key role in increasing the glutamine influx for tumor cells to maintain such high metabolic rates required for rapid proliferation. The first structures of ASCT2 were recently determined experimentally, making this a newly viable target for structure-based studies ASCT2 was only recently discovered to play a critical role in cancer cell metabolism and little medicinal chemistry efforts have been focused on ASCT2 antagonist development allowing immense potential for breaking into new compound scaffolds for further testing. Currently, there have not been any ASCT2 drug campaigns that incorporate computational drug discovery methods and this proposal outlines the first studies dedicated to this.  Many institutions and pharmaceutical companies have implemented computational strategies into drug discovery pipelines as a means to produce viable drug candidates in a more cost-efficient and timely manner. Depending on the target of interest, researchers focus more intently on either ligand-based (LB) or structure-based (SB) methods, but rarely are these two methods hybridized in a sophisticated fashion. By utilizing strategies of both LB- and SB- computational drug discovery, I intend to merge the advantages of both methodologies as a means to sample and filter large chemical space more efficiently. Our lab has active development in two computational chemistry software suites: Rosetta primarily focuses on SB methods whereas the Biology and Chemistry Library (BCL) contains advanced cheminformatics toolsets for LB methods. The focus of my project will be to integrate the RosettaDrugDesign code to allow a more extensive, yet efficient sampling of chemical space using ligand-based techniques. We intend to incorporate these more advanced LB techniques available in the BCL, including multi-tasking artificial neural networks for Quantitative Structure- Activity Relationship predictions, to filter compounds during docking simulations within the RosettaDrugDesign. By bringing together the structure prediction abilities of Rosetta and small- molecule tools of BCL, we anticipate exceptional advances in our abilities to efficiently design drugs for ASCT2. Project Narrative The upregulated influx of amino acids is critical to maintain an altered metabolic state for rapidly proliferating cells such as those found in tumors, making transporters such as ASCT2 a promising target for cancer therapeutics. Computational-based drug discovery methods have not been heavily utilized for ASCT2 due to lack of an experimentally determined structure; however with the recently solved structure, these methods are now possible and highly favorable for guiding medicinal chemistry efforts. This proposal outlines the plans for hybridized structure- and ligand-based approaches for computational drug discovery of ASCT2 antagonists and the experimental validation obtained utilizing in silico methods.","Hybridized structure- and ligand- based drug discovery approaches targeting ASCT2, an amino acid transporter critical for upregulated cell proliferation in numerous cancer types",10003012,F31CA243353,"['Alanine', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Transporter', 'Amino Acids', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Cysteine', 'Data', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Education', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Facility Accesses', 'Formulation', 'Glutamine', 'Homologous Protein', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Paper', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Play', 'Proliferating', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Pythons', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Serine', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Two-Hybrid System Techniques', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cancer type', 'cheminformatics', 'computational chemistry', 'computing resources', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'in silico', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'interest', 'member', 'metabolic rate', 'method development', 'multitask', 'neoplastic cell', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein structure', 'protein structure prediction', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic development', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor metabolism']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,F31,2021,38247
"A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition A novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition Abstract Drug metabolism and disposition are essential xenobiotic responses. The long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding RNAs larger than 200 nucleotides (nt) in length and do not have protein-coding potentials. Although many of the biological functions of lncRNAs have been recognized, it is unclear whether and how lncRNAs can regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters and if so, whether the regulations are implicated in cancer chemo-resistance. Through integrative analysis of cancer non-coding genomic and high-through drug screening data of 505 cancer cell lines, our preliminary study have discovered and functionally characterized a group of ADME(drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, whose up-regulation is associated with resistance to more than 100 chemotherapy compounds and may regulate drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters through interacting with xenobiotic nuclear receptor. We hypothesize that dysregulation of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs is an important contributor for the development of cancer chemo-resistance. Mechanistically, ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs. We propose three specific aims to test our hypotheses: In Aim 1, we will perform bioinformatic analysis and molecularly clone of lncRNAs associated with cancer chemo-resistance and clinical prognosis. In Aim 2: we will functional characterize of ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, using in vivo and in vitro cancer chemotherapy models. In Aim 3: we will determine the mechanism by which ADME chemo-resistance lncRNAs, including LINC00992, regulate the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Chemotherapy remains a mainstay in the clinical management of cancer patients, but chemo-resistance is a major challenge to overcome. Understanding the novel lncRNA responsive and xenobiotic nuclear receptor- mediated chemo-resistance will help provide novel strategies to enhance therapeutic efficacy and avoid the development of chemo-resistance. Narrative The goal of this study is to reveal a novel lncRNA-responsive and xenobiotic receptor-mediated regulation of drug metabolism and disposition. Specifically, we propose to test the hypothesis that a group of novel lncRNAs, identified by our computational analysis and experimental validation, can affect chemo-resistance through their regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters that are responsible for the metabolism and disposition of chemotherapy drugs.

"Long Acting Injectable Depots for TB Therapy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Patient dosing adherence is often compromised by the complex pill regimes and long duration of current TB drug therapies. These challenges are exacerbated in settings for patients in many social and global settings where TB co-therapy with HIV positive patients is stigmatized. Long-acting drug delivery products should therefore play an important role to increase patient adherence and increase drug efficacy. This project will develop a new injectable depot technology that address a general target product profile that includes multiple-month delivery from a single injection, low volume and low viscosity formulations to reduce patient pain, combination drug formulation where required, sustained drug release with designable PK profiles, minimal initial and run-out burst release to increase safety and prevent drug resistance, and for global settings has low cost of goods and lowered cold-chain requirements. This depot technology also has the important translational product attributes of streamlined CMC and cGMP manufacturing that could lead to more rapid clinical development achievement. A new injectable depot product for TB therapy will be developed that is differentiated from current dispersal based formulation approaches by being a fully synthetic depot. The proposal is structured around 2 specific aims in the R61 phase and two further aims in the R33 phase: (1) Prodrug monomers made by synthetic chemistry are directly polymerized in a second synthetic step to create “drugamer” depot therapeutics that have the drugs built into the depot itself. Compared to current dispersion formulation approaches, the drugamers exhibit higher drug loading efficiencies, the ability to co-formulate drugs of different lipophilicities, and linear, individually tailorable PK profiles that minimize first- and last-week burst release. These PK profiles are kinetically controlled by the linker properties that are tied to the individual drugs, along with polymer architectural design. This aim will exploit a unique high throughput polymer library and screening platform at CSIRO Melbourne to identify lead injectable depot designs using bedaquiline and moxifloxicin as initial drug examples. Sophisticated LC-MS/MS PK characterization will assess the sustained PK profile together with PK/PK modeling. (2) Evolve and optimize depot lead candidates through efficacy in an initial TB model that allows higher throughput imaging characterization of activity. This will be followed by an Mtb model assessment and selection to a lead depot candidate; (3) Test and optimize the two lead drug depot candidates in an A/BSL3 Mtb model, by the criteria of PK/PD, efficacy and dose dependence, and dosing duration. The lead depot will also be characterized in accelerated stability studies to test whether they can avoid cold-chain storage. (4) Evaluate iterated up-selected depots in combination depots from mixing optimized bedaquiline and moxifloxacin depots, including dual PK profiling and PK/PD modeling. This same approach could also be expanded to develop future therapeutic products based on other combination drug depot designs. These favorable platform attributes motivate this this project as a potential new addition to the repertoire of anti-TB patient products. Project Narrative This project will provide TB therapy products that make patient adherence to monotherapy and combination drug therapy more effective. The new technology will provide drug dosing from a single injectable product that can be tailored to 2-3 month dosing from single injections. Patients will experience lower pain and the product will reduce the need for refrigeration to increase impact globally.",Long Acting Injectable Depots for TB Therapy,10236790,R61AI161820,"['Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Architecture', 'Attenuated', 'Automation', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cold Chains', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Complex', 'Cyclic GMP', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Dose', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Formulations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug resistance', 'Exhibits', 'Formulation', 'Freeze Drying', 'Future', 'HIV', 'HIV Seropositivity', 'HIV therapy', 'HIV/TB', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Injectable', 'Injections', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Moxifloxacin', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Polymer Chemistry', 'Polymers', 'Powder dose form', 'Prodrugs', 'Property', 'Refrigeration', 'Regimen', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Solubility', 'Stigmatization', 'Structure', 'Synthesis Chemistry', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Virulent', 'Viscosity', 'Water', 'Weight', 'base', 'biosafety level 3 facility', 'chronic infection', 'clinical development', 'co-infection', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'design', 'drug efficacy', 'drug release profile', 'experience', 'first-in-human', 'innovation', 'lead candidate', 'lipophilicity', 'monomer', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics', 'pill', 'prevent', 'product development', 'screening', 'social', 'solid state', 'therapy duration', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R61,2021,686389
"Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis OVERVIEW SUMMARY Our TMRC program “Optimizing surveillance and treatment for control of cutaneous leishmaniasis”constitutes a concerted transdisciplinary and intersectorialeffort to address fundamental constraints on the control of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Colombia and the Latin American Region. Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment. However, the dispersed distribution of the populations at risk, underreporting, unavailability of information on the effectiveness of treatments administered, and increasing rates of treatment failure and evidence of drug resistance to the few available antileishmanial drugs undermine and subvert control efforts. The Goal of the TMRC “Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis” will be developed at three inter-related levels of response to treatment: Host innate responses affecting outcome of treatment and corresponding biomarkers; Parasite-dependent factors in drug susceptibility and therapeutic outcome; Active detection of affected Communities, cases and treatment follow-up.  1. To address critical knowledge gaps in the targeting and evaluation of interventions for control of  cutaneous leishmaniasis.  2. To determine the relation of parasite susceptibility to anti-leishmanial drugs with the clinical and  parasitological response to standard-of-care treatment, and parasite factors defining this relationship.  3. Identify innate host functions that contribute to cure or failure during antileishmanial drug therapy and  their related biomarkers. This Center Program will be developed by a multidisciplinary team of national and international investigators that includes recognized experts, mid-career and new investigators in the relevant fields: Epidemiology, Vector Ecology, Molecular Biology and Genomics, Immunology and Cell Biology. The Principal Investigators and Core Leaders have already worked together successfully. Each brings high level specialized capacities to the corresponding projects and together, provide a broad scope of vision to the TMRC. Each Research Project will contribute to more effective control by addressing information and knowledge gaps and barriers to opportune, appropriate treatment to achieve cure, decrease the risk of relapse and by providing information and tools to reduce the prevalence and consequences of cutaneous leishmaniasis. CIDEIM is a WHO Collaborating Center for Leishmaniasis since 1992. The scope and focus of proposed TMRC program on the optimization of surveillance and treatment will be synergistic with our role as a WHOCC allowing the TMRC research and training program to channel and amplify capacity building within the Region and to translate findings to the competent national authorities OVERVIEW NARRATIVE Control of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis is centered on case identification and treatment.

The results will provide bases for community managed surveillance and follow-up of treatment, improve standard-of care treatment, enlighten the development of innovative therapeutics and inform policy for control.",Optimizing Surveillance and Treatment for Control of Cutaneous Leishmaniasis,10131105,U19AI129910,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colombia', 'Communities', 'Cryopreservation', 'Cutaneous', 'Cutaneous Leishmaniasis', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Exposure', 'Drug resistance', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Host Defense Mechanism', 'Immunology', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Latin American', 'Leishmania', 'Leishmaniasis', 'Lesion', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Parasites', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern recognition receptor', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Policies', 'Population Distributions', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Reaction Time', 'Receptor Signaling', 'Registries', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resistance', 'Respondent', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Therapeutic', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Variant', 'Vector Ecology', 'Vision', 'Work', 'Zoonoses', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'design', 'eosinophil', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'monocyte', 'multidisciplinary', 'national surveillance', 'neutrophil', 'novel', 'predictive marker', 'profiles in patients', 'programs', 'receptor expression', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'therapy outcome', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'vector']",NIAID,CENTRO INTERNACIONAL  (CIDEIM),U19,2021,539134
"Modeling to Design Treatments for Idiopathic Lung Fibrosis PROJECT SUMMARY Every year in this country 40,000 patients are diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and terminal disease caused by excessive extracellular matrix production by myofibroblasts in distributed lesions, or “fibrotic foci”, throughout the lung. Despite the availability of two FDA-approved drugs that are considered standard of care, the mortality rate for IPF patients exceeds 30% at four years, and there are no drugs that halt disease progression, making diagnosis with IPF a death sentence for over 500,000 Americans living with this disease. Identifying the cells of origin that give rise to myofibroblasts is necessary for finding treatments that can halt or cure IPF. Based on experimental data and computational simulations from our research team, we hypothesize that myofibroblasts arise from microvascular pericytes (cells that normally enwrap capillaries) when heterotypic pericyte-endothelial interactions become disrupted. We further posit that strategic modulation of kinase-mediated signaling in pericytes can prevent pericyte-to-myofibroblast transitions and halt the progression of IPF. We propose to combine computational modeling with experiments to study pericyte-to-myofibroblast differentiation and to investigate how microvessel adaptations in the lung contribute to IPF. Specifically, we will develop a new agent-based model (ABM) that incorporates logic-based intracellular signaling networks to simulate cell behaviors and leverages Bayesian inference for rule refinement (Aim 1), validate the ABM's ability to predict pericyte phenotype transitions and the emergence of fibrotic foci in response to drugs using the murine bleomycin model of IPF (Aim 2), and bridge murine experiments with clinical data in order to predict how druggable kinase-driven signaling pathways affect IPF progression via modulation of pericytes and microvessels (Aim 3). To our knowledge, our proposed studies will be the first to combine computational modeling with experiments to study microvascular contributors to IPF progression. In addition to producing a new computational model that is validated for bridging pre-clinical study results to clinical outcomes, we expect to identify new therapeutic approaches for IPF that target microvascular cells, previously underexplored but potentially critical contributors to this deadly disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a deadly disease caused by uncontrolled tissue fibrosis in the lungs. There are no FDA-approved drugs that cure or prevent disease progression. We propose to combine computational modeling with experiments study how fibroblasts and microvessel remodeling in the lung contribute to disease and to identify novel drugs and drug combinations that target these processes in order to effectively treat IPF.",Modeling to Design Treatments for Idiopathic Lung Fibrosis,10305193,R01HL155143,"['Affect', 'Alveolar', 'American', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Bleomycin', 'Blood capillaries', 'Cardiac', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computer Simulation', 'Country', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug usage', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Endothelium', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'FDA approved', 'Fibroblasts', 'Fibrosis', 'Harvest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Lesion', 'Logic', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Myofibroblast', 'Nature', 'New Agents', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pericytes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Pirfenidone', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'Research', 'Retina', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tamoxifen', 'Terminal Disease', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'To specify', 'Transforming Growth Factors', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-1', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'base', 'cell behavior', 'experimental study', 'human data', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'kinase inhibitor', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'pulmonary agents', 'pulmonary function', 'response', 'skeletal', 'standard of care', 'therapy design', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,548214
"Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency Project Abstract Haploinsufficiency plays a crucial role in Neurofibromatosis (NF1), an autosomal dominant genetic disorder impacting over 120,000 individuals in the United States. Current therapeutic approaches focus on specific components of NF1 signaling, for example inhibiting MEK signaling pathways in tumors, thus failing to address the broad range of signaling and symptoms associated with NF1. Given that NF1 is characterized by both autosomal dominance and haploinsufficiency (lack of normal protein), upregulating protein expression of the remaining wild-type NF1 allele has the ability to compensate for loss of function from the mutant allele, thus alleviating a broad range of NF1 symptoms and overall disease progression. Infixion proposes to build a luciferase reporting assay to evaluate NF1 expression against known drugs, including 50+ compounds, across six drug classes, already identified by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression. By confirming that these candidate drugs activate NF1 transcription, increase NF1 protein expression, and normalize Ras pathway signaling in NF1 +/- Schwann cells, and by further screening libraries of known drugs for increased NF1 expression, we propose a novel path of NF1 drug discovery that will impact a broad range of NF1 patients and symptoms, in a preventative manner, and without regard to the wide spectrum of NF1 genetic mutations. Research Background. Increasing NF1 expression via transfection reverses abnormal Ras activation resulting from NF1 loss (Wallis, et al. 2018). Transcriptional activation in other genetic conditions such as Willams-Beuren Syndrome, and Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis compensates for haploinsufficiency (Giordano, et al. 2012). Lastly, overcoming haploinsufficiency in another autosomal dominant condition (Sim1 induced obesity; mouse model) was recently shown using a Crispr/dCas9 transcriptional activator (Ahituv, et al. 2019). Specific Aims. 1) Construct a luciferase reporter assay engineered into the endogenous NF1 gene of a well characterized, publically available, immortalized NF1 +/- Schwann cell line (Wallace et al. 2016; data published at Synapse.org). Validate assay using a viral transcription factor developed by Infixion using Crispr/dCas9 to upregulate NF1. 2) Deploy this NF1 luciferase reporter assay to screen 50+ known drugs shown by Infixion to correlate with increased NF1 expression across various cell/tissue types. Next, use this validated luciferase reporter to screen a 13,000+ compound repurposing library of known drugs available from Scripps Research Institute (known as ReFrame). 3) The top hits from Aim 2 screens will be evaluated, utilizing both immortalized and iPSC derived NF1+/- Schwann cells, for the following: a) ability to induce NF1 mRNA and protein expression, using qPCR and Westerns, b) the impact on Ras signaling (pERK, ELK-1, AKT, etc.) utilizing a targeted quantitative mass spec proteomics assay, c) their broader impact on gene expression in Schwann cells utilizing RNAseq, d) impact on cell proliferation, and e) their safety profile based on published data from previous trials. The goal is to prioritize not more than 3-5 candidates to take forward into a Phase 2 evaluation. Project Narrative Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that impacts an estimated 1 in 3000 people worldwide, and one that is characterized by a complex set of symptoms shown to be dependent on haploinsufficiency (i.e., the lack of normal protein). By upregulating NF1 protein expression from the normal allele by two-fold, and thus restoring normal levels of functional NF1 protein in tissues important in NF1, we target a range of NF1 symptoms by eliminating the haploinsufficient environment. We propose to develop and utilize NF1-specific luciferase reporter and proteomic assays, along with standard small molecule evaluation tools, to characterize a small molecule library of repurposed drugs for their ability to upregulate NF1 transcription, and to further evaluate the resulting impact of “hits” on NF1 protein expression, cell proliferation, gene expression specificity, as well as downstream pathways (such as Ras, MEK, mTOR) known to be dysregulated by mutations in the NF1 gene.",Increasing NF1 Expression as a Treatment for NF1 Haploinsufficiency,10145101,R43NS117234,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease Progression', 'Dominant Genetic Conditions', 'Drug Screening', 'ELK1 gene', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'FRAP1 gene', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heterozygote', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Luciferases', 'MEKs', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modification', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'NF1 gene', 'Neurofibromatoses', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Obese Mice', 'Orphan Drugs', 'Other Genetics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Preventive treatment', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Publishing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reagent', 'Regimen', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Schwann Cells', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure of thyroid parafollicular cell', 'Supravalvular aortic stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcend', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Williams Syndrome', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain pathway', 'commercialization', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'drug repurposing', 'gene expression database', 'gene therapy', 'genomic variation', 'high throughput screening', 'in vivo Model', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Expression', 'mouse model', 'mutant', 'neurofibroma', 'novel', 'phase 2 testing', 'programs', 'protein expression', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'small molecule libraries', 'success', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NINDS,"INFIXION BIOSCIENCE, INC.",R43,2021,150794
"Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response. PROJECT SUMMARY Precision oncology relies on the hypothesis that further characterizing a patient's tumor will lead to better predictions of treatment response. While this approach effectively breaks diagnoses into smaller and smaller subtypes likely to respond to a given targeted inhibitor, the downside is it results in highly fragmented clinical data spread across multiple treatment arms. The more progress the field makes in assigning new therapies, the harder it will be to accrue adequate sample size to test another therapy. Direct screening of cancer cell lines and primary samples on panels of targeted inhibitors is a uniquely promising approach to this problem, turning every patient sample into a hundred mini experiments, but clinical validation of in vitro drug-response predictions have been hampered by limited numbers of patients who are screened and actually treated with any given drug. Such an evaluation is critical to determine the predictive value gained from drug screening of patient samples. Over the past seven years the Knight Cancer Institute has performed drug screening paired alongside genomic and/or RNA sequencing for over 600 primary leukemic samples. Within two years, we will have accumulated over 200 patients not only screened for in vitro drug response but then treated with matched targeted inhibitors. I will leverage this existing and growing dataset to interrogate the power of in vitro drug screening data to predict clinical response using retrospective data. I will establish a robust framework for primary drug screening and analysis, build interpretable models for clinical decision making, and explore mechanisms controlling drug response. This project will result in improvements to high-throughput drug screening, a thorough accounting of the predictive power of in vitro drug screening, and candidates for treatment combinations in resistant tumors. My goal is to become an independent investigator and cross-disciplinary leader in patient sample multi-omic profiling, targeted therapy selection, and translational oncology. During my mentored phase I will be receiving guidance from Dr. Emek Demir, an expert in computational modeling of systems biology, Dr. Jeffery Tyner, a leader in patient sample drug screening and validation, and Dr. Brian Druker, a pioneer of targeted cancer therapy and director of the Knight Cancer Institute. I will also improve my statistical understanding of complex systems by working with my advisory committee member Dr Tomi Mori, learn to integrate large datasets and predicting patient outcomes from Dr. Shannon McWeeney, and improve upon existing drug screening platforms and analysis methods with Dr. Laura Heiser. I am determined to attain an independent faculty position and my mentors have committed to assisting me in the application and transition process. PROJECT NARRATIVE A promising field of cancer treatment is targeted therapy, where each patient is prescribed different drugs precisely based on the features of their cancer. We have a large dataset of patients where we tested drugs on their cancer cells in the lab, and later the patient received the same drug as part of their therapy. I will investigate the best methods for testing drugs on each patient's cancer, how effective these tests are for predicting how well a treatment will work in each patient, and why some patients don't see the benefit from targeted therapy we normally expect.",Assessing the power of primary drug-screens to predict clinical response.,10092124,K99CA245896,"['ABL1 gene', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aftercare', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Committee Members', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Screening', 'ERBB2 gene', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'German population', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'In Vitro', 'Institutes', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Leukemic Cell', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Screening for cancer', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Source', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'cancer subtypes', 'cancer therapy', 'care outcomes', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'combinatorial', 'conventional therapy', 'design', 'drug response prediction', 'drug sensitivity', 'drug testing', 'exhaustion', 'experimental study', 'high-throughput drug screening', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'large datasets', 'leukemia', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'model design', 'multiple omics', 'multitask', 'new combination therapies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient screening', 'patient stratification', 'phosphoproteomics', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'response', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'survival prediction', 'targeted agent', 'targeted cancer therapy', 'targeted treatment', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment arm', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'validation studies']",NCI,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,137956
"Next generation drugs for bipolar depression and maintenance Blue Oak Pharmaceuticals is developing the next generation of drugs for the treatment of acute bipolar depression and long-term maintenance (BPD), a mental disorder that affects ~6 million adult Americans. Existing drug classes are relatively ineffective and very few new modes-of-action have been developed in the past 40+ years. This is due, in part, to the biopharma industry’s focus on drugging single molecular targets, and the lack of predictive animal models for bipolar disorder. To overcome these significant hurdles, Blue Oak’s drug discovery paradigm combines custom-designed privileged chemotypes with a proven deep behavioral profiling method. Successful Phase I studies using this novel, but previously validated, approach resulted in the discovery and optimization of a novel lead compound for the treatment of BPD. The therapeutic utility of drug candidates was confirmed using molecular target profiling, ex vivo imaging of the forebrain circuits implicated in BPD and predictive translational medicine biomarkers. Phase II studies are focused on advancing the lead compound through Investigational New Drug (IND)-enabling studies, the necessary next step for FDA review and approval of human studies. Aims include: (1) quantification of the preclinical therapeutic (safety) margin for the lead, or superior back-up molecule, including analyses of antidepressant activity; (2) confirmation of an enhanced EEG gamma band as a reliable translational biomarker of BPD drug activity and efficacy in non-human primates; (3) manufacture and qualification of cGLP drug product suitable for IND-enabling studies; and (4) completion of preclinical studies necessary for an IND filing with the FDA, including standard absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADME/TOX) preclinical studies and preclinical dose escalation studies necessary prior to first-in-human clinical studies. The successful completion of these aims will result in a Type B meeting to obtain guidance from the FDA and the filing of an IND package. The Blue Oak Pharmaceuticals team includes experienced “drug hunters” with expertise in systems neurobiology, medicinal chemistry and informatics, and advisors with proven track records in drug development and commercialization. The internal team is supported by trusted partners in preclinical research, development and validation of translational medicine biomarkers, clinical site management, and clinical development. If successful, this program will deliver a new drug candidate for bipolar depression that will improve the quality of life of patients and their families. This proposal aims to discover the next generation of drugs for the treatment of acute bipolar depression and long-term maintenance (BPD), a mental disorder that affects ~6 million adult Americans and imposes a significant medical, social, and economic burden. Unfortunately, existing drug classes are relatively ineffective for most patients and very few new therapeutic mechanisms have been developed into medications in the past 40+ years.

"An Integrative Approach to Drug Repositioning Using Decision Tree Based Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite recent advances in life sciences and technology, the amount of money spent developing a single drug has stayed drastically expensive. Overall efficiencies have caused drug development to stay the same, with an average cost of $2.6 billion and 15 years to develop a single drug. Considering these challenges, there is an increased need for drug repositioning, in which new indications are found for existing or unapproved drugs. Here we introduce an approach that integrates only drug similarity metrics, such as side effect, structure, and target similarities, to identify novel indications for drugs. By focusing on drug similarity metrics, our proposed method allows for applications towards orphan molecules that presently have no primary indication. To improve upon the current methods of drug repurposing, we propose the developing of a computational approach that utilizes multiple data types within a machine-learning framework in order to predict indications a drug may treat. Based on the observations that similar drugs are used for similar indications, this method utilizes publicly available databases to identify associations between drugs, and integrates drug similarity data, as well as drug-target specific information, into a machine-learning framework in order to accurately predict indications for these drugs. Altogether, our method provides a novel, broadly applicable strategy that can identify novel indications, allowing for an accelerated and more efficient method for future drug development and repositioning efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Bringing a drug to market requires an enormous amount of time and money, so our proposed research is designed to address this unmet need to streamline the drug discovery process.

"Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens PROJECT SUMMARY We currently have an unprecedented ability to profile the genetic- and pathway-level changes that occur in cancer. Yet, clinicians lack the diverse arsenal of drugs needed to treat subpopulations of patients more effectively, reduce side effects and offer second-line treatment when drug resistance emerges. There is a pressing need to dramatically increase the repertoire of drugs available to fight cancer. Advances in automated microscopy and computer vision, allow the widespread use of phenotypic profiling in early drug discovery. In this grant, we address two challenges. First, the power of phenotypic profiling has led to a growing number of large, disparate image datasets. In aim 1, we will develop machine-learning approaches that combine disparate datasets to obtain accurate predictions of uncharacterized compound function. Second, phenotypic screens can identify candidate compounds across multiple, diverse pathways, but often only use a single cancer cell line. In aim 2, we will develop strategies to identify minimal collections of cell lines that maximize detection of small molecule activities. Successful execution will: increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing existing phenotypic screening datasets and providing a rational approach for selecting cell lines that maximize the chance of discovering hits in desired pathways. In this proposal, we will develop computational and experimental methods to maximize the power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens. Our studies will increase the power of phenotypic profiling by harnessing screens performed across the world, providing a rational approach for maximizing the chance of discovering hits for diverse pathways in future screens, and identifying novel compounds that expand our ability to perturb cancer-relevant pathways. Our proposal is designed to accelerate the pace of early drug discovery.","Maximizing the predictive power of high-throughput, microscopy-based phenotypic screens",10090573,R01CA184984,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Cycle Regulation', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Drug resistance', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Grant', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'Time', 'base', 'cancer type', 'chemical genetics', 'deep learning', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'druggable target', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'proteostasis', 'response', 'screening', 'side effect', 'small molecule', 'transcriptomics']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,1
"Novel computational approaches to predict drug response and combination effects Summary Tailoring the most desired therapy to each individual patient is the primary goal of precision medicine. A reliable and robust predictive model of drug effectiveness based on patients' unique genomic background is the key. For decades, communities have been trying to establish the relationship between molecular characteristics and drug response in complex diseases. Over the last decade, a large amount of genomic and epigenomic data together with pharmacogenomics data and response to perturbations data has been generated for many human cell lines through collaborations in the research community. These projects have led to significant therapeutic discoveries and have provided unprecedented opportunities to predict drug response using molecular fingerprints. However, even with great interest and effort in developing computational methods for predicting drug response, the prediction accuracies are at best only moderate. A related but distinct question is to understand the mechanisms of action (MOA) of drugs. Understanding drug MOAs enables characterization of drug side effects and identification of old drugs for new uses (i.e. drug repositioning). The traditional experimental assays to identify MOAs of drugs are expensive and time- consuming. There are three key questions to be addressed in the study. 1. Can novel computational approaches largely improve prediction accuracy of response to single drugs using comprehensive genomic and chemical information? 2. Can computational approaches provide a systematic way to mine genomics and drug response data to generate biological insights into the mechanisms of actions of various drugs? 3. Is it possible to develop an interpretable and accurate computation model to predict drug combination effects using pharmacogenomics data? Inherent features make it very challenging to predict drug response accurately: High-dimensionality of input data, the complex relationship between input features and response data; and heterogeneous drug/compound response patterns across different genetic lineages. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been making remarkable strides in various applications owing to the rapid progress of “deep learning. In Aim 1 of this study, we will develop novel AI-based approaches to address the computational challenges of improving the prediction accuracy of drug response. In Aim 2 of the study, we will develop a novel computation framework to study of MOA of drugs. In Aim 3, we will develop an interpretable deep-learning based computational framework to predict drug combination effects. In addition, we will develop a user-friendly web portal as an integrated research platform to share the methodology, algorithms and data generated from this proposed study to the research community.

"Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries Our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and structure-based design of drugs for treatment, rely on experimentally determined 3D structures of proteins and other macromolecules complexed with small molecule ligands. Many of these structures have direct relevance to public health, especially complexes of drug targets with drugs, inhibitors, substrates, or allosteric effectors. Yet, structure-based drug discovery is severely complicated and hindered by experimental bias and the shortcomings of current methods of experimental ligand identification, which often result in misidentified, missing, or misplaced ligands. The propagation of erroneous structures combined with an increased accessibility to structural data not only thwarts reproducibility in biomedical research and drug discovery, but also diverts valuable resources down doomed research avenues. We will leverage our extensive experience validating and refining ligand binding sites to generate ligand reference libraries that will be made publically available on a new web resource dedicated to the interaction of small molecules and macromolecules. These libraries can be used in many downstream applications, such as drug design, computational chemistry, biology, and bioinformatics. We will utilize recent technological advances in machine learning in conjunction with existing tools to create a standardized protocol for density interpretation and unbiased, reproducible ligand identification. This pipeline will not only be able identify and model ligands in unassigned density fragments, but also be able to detect and correct suboptimally refined ligands in existing structures. As the proposed AI will be free from cognitive bias, it should alleviate the most severe problems in structure-based drug design. Because improperly interpreted structures can have a significant deleterious ripple effect, we will experimentally verify select biomedically important structures with dubious experimental support for critical small molecules using use X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy. This proposal addresses current shortcomings of ligand identification in experimentally determined structures through a combination of novel machine learning algorithms and existing validation mechanisms. The main deliverables are 1) curated libraries of validated ligand binding sites and the tools used to produce the libraries and 2) a machine learning assisted pipeline for the interpretation of density fragments corresponding to small molecules within macromolecular structures. Some biologically important ligand binding sites with ambiguous, incomplete, or no experimental data will be experimentally verified using X-ray crystallography or electron microscopy.","Reproducible, Unbiased Ligand Identification Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Development of Ligand Reference Libraries",10200091,R01GM132595,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Categories', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Effectiveness', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Ensure', 'FAIR principles', 'Generations', 'Human', 'Intuition', 'Ions', 'Libraries', 'Ligand Binding', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Nucleic Acid Binding', 'Ontology', 'Peptides', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recommendation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stratification', 'Structural Models', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teaching Materials', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computational chemistry', 'density', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macromolecule', 'novel', 'online resource', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'software development', 'stem', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,561173
"In silico safety pharmacology PROJECT SUMMARY: A major factor plaguing drug development is that there is no drug-screening tool that can distinguish between drugs that will induce cardiac arrhythmias from chemically similar safe drugs. The current approaches rely on substitute markers such as action potential duration or QT interval prolongation on the ECG. There is an urgent need to identify a new approach that can predict actual proarrhythmia from the drug chemistry rather than relying on surrogate indicators. We have brought together an expert team to innovate at the interfaces of experimental and computational modeling disciplines and develop an in silico simulation pipeline to predict cardiotoxicity over multiple temporal and spatial scales from the atom to the cardiac rhythm. An essential and unique aspect of our approach is that we propose to utilize atomistic scale simulation to predict the transition rates of ion channels and adrenergic receptors and how they are modified by drug interaction. We hypothesize that it is the subtleties of these interactions that are likely to be the critical determinants of drug associated safety or proarrhythmia. In the last award period, we successfully developed an unprecedented linkage: We connected the highly disparate space and time scales of ion channel structure and function. We utilized atomistic simulation to compute drug kinetic rates were directly used as parameters in a hERG function model. The model components were then integrated into predictive models at the cell and tissue scales to expose fundamental arrhythmia vulnerability mechanisms and complex interactions underlying emergent behaviors. Human clinical data were used for model validation and showed excellent agreement, demonstrating feasibility of this new approach for cardiotoxicity prediction. In this renewal application we propose to hugely extend this approach to include prediction of the interaction of cardiac channel gating and drug interaction as well as the inclusion of adrenergic receptor interactions with drugs. Another essential aspect of safety pharmacology is the development of new approaches to allow more efficient drug design, screening and prediction of cardiotoxicity. Therefore, we will seek to develop, extend and apply a variety of machine learning and deep learning approaches to improve drug discovery by predicting proarrhythmia from the drug chemistry with an efficient process that identify drug congeners via machine learning to maximize therapy and minimize side effects. Finally, we propose to classify drugs into categories based on proarrhythmia risk in normal and diseased virtual tissue settings. The multiscale model for prediction of cardiopharmacology that we will develop in this application will be applied to projects demonstrating its usefulness for efficacy or toxicity of drug treatments in the complex physiological system of the heart. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Cardiotoxicity in the form of deadly abnormal rhythms is one of the most common and dangerous risks for drugs in development. There is an urgent need for new approaches to accurately screen and predict the effects of drugs on cardiac rhythms.

"Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions Abstract The overall goal of my research program is to develop and apply computational tools to facilitate the rational design of modulators of important cellular pathways for therapeutic use. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) are central factors in cellular signaling and gene regulation networks. Their misregulation is associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, autoimmune disease, and diabetes. Inevitably, many PPIs are biologically compelling targets for drug discovery. But despite a few notable successes, most PPIs have not been successfully targeted and remain undruggable. The fundamental challenge derives from their intrinsic structural features: the binding surfaces of many PPIs are generally large in area, flat, and dynamic. PPIs are often transient and involve multivalent contacts. Currently, one most promising PPI inhibitor discovery strategy is to use miniature protein domain mimetics (PDMs) to reproduce the key interface contacts utilized by nature. PDMs are advantageous as medium-sized molecules with high surface complementarity and a broader set of contact points than typical small molecules, but are still limited because—by definition—only a portion of the total PPI binding energy is captured in the interaction. The binding affinity of the synthetic domains is often lower than the cognate full-length proteins. On the other hand, targeted covalent inhibition is an orthogonal therapeutic approach fit to overcome the fundamental binding limitations at PPIs, but has a well-known drawback: the high reactivity of typical covalent warheads leads to nonspecific inhibition, and toxicity. Here we aim to develop computational methods for a new design strategy that will leverage the strengths of these two methods—PDMs and covalent inhibition—while simultaneously mitigating their respective limitations. The focus of the effort is to rationally discover potent inhibitors that will non-covalently recognize and then covalently target protein-protein binding interfaces with exquisite specificity. Furthermore, our development of robust scoring functions by integrating multitask machine learning and molecular modeling would significantly accelerate the rational drug discovery process. The planned work builds on our recent advances in three state-of-the-art computational approaches: AlphaSpace for fragment- centric topographical mapping of PPI interfaces; ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics for modeling covalent inhibition; and a novel delta-machine learning strategy to simultaneously improve scoring, docking and screening performance of a protein-ligand scoring function. Our design efforts will result in highly specific and potent modulators of a variety of therapeutically important but previously undruggable PPI interfaces, providing new leads for drug development. Project Narrative Our computational methodology development work will lead to powerful computational tools for rational design of covalent and non-covalent inhibitors, which would significantly accelerate the drug discovery process. Our computational modulator design would result in highly specific and potent inhibitors of a variety of therapeutic targets, which can be used as tools for studying cell signaling and gene regulation, and as new leads for drug development.",Computational modulator design and machine learning to target protein-protein interactions,10152659,R35GM127040,"['Affinity', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Length', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Tertiary Protein Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Uses', 'Toxic effect', 'Work', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'learning strategy', 'mimetics', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular modeling', 'multitask', 'novel', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R35,2021,556806
"Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts PROJECT SUMMARY Collaborative Drug Discovery, Inc. (CDD) proposes to continue development of a novel approach based on deep learning neural networks to encode molecules into chemically rich vectors. In Phase 1 we demonstrated that this representation enables computational models that more accurately predict the chemical properties of molecules than state-of-the-art models, yet are also far simpler to build because they do not require any expert decisions or optimization to achieve high performance. In Phase 2 we will exploit this unprecedented simplicity to develop an intuitive software package that will for the first time enable any chemist or biologist working in drug discovery to create and run their own predictive models – without relying on specialized cheminformatics expertise – yet still achieve or exceed the accuracy of the best currently available techniques. Scientists engaged in drug discovery research from academic laboratories to large pharmaceutical companies rely on computational QSAR models to predict pharmacologically relevant properties and obviate the need to perform expensive, time-consuming assays (many of which require animal studies) for every molecule of interest. Improved models will enable researchers to select lead candidate series more effectively, explore chemical space around leads to generate novel IP more efficiently, reduce failure rates for compounds advancing through the drug discovery pipeline, and accelerate the entire drug discovery process. These benefits will be realized broadly across most therapeutic areas.  We also plan to take the technology one step further, leveraging our chemically rich vector representation to enable the software to creatively suggest novel compounds (which do not appear in the training libraries, screening libraries, or lead series) that outperform the lead candidates simultaneously on bioactivity, ADME/Tox and PK assays . Solving this inverse problem is the Holy Grail of computational medicinal chemistry and has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will create novel computational tools that will help researchers to understand whether potential new drugs are likely to be both safe and effective, and identify similar compounds that are likely to be safer and more effective against the same target. This innovative capability will help to accelerate the discovery and development of novel and improved drugs against a wide range of diseases. !",Novel deep learning strategy to better predict pharmacological properties of candidate drugs and focus discovery efforts,10133177,R44TR002527,"['Animals', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Failure', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Intuition', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Libraries', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Permeability', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Solubility', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'absorption', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'chemical property', 'cheminformatics', 'computational chemistry', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'lead candidate', 'lead series', 'learning strategy', 'melting', 'model building', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'vector', 'voice recognition']",NCATS,"COLLABORATIVE DRUG DISCOVERY, INC.",R44,2021,749928
"New Methods and Tools for Computational Drug Discovery Project Summary  My goal is to develop effective and efﬁcient computational methods for drug discovery, apply these methods to ﬁnd new and efﬁcacious drugs to treat diseases, and deploy these methods in easy-to-use open source tools. My research group pioneered the development and integration of deep neural networks in user-friendly molecular docking software for structure-based drug design to predict poses and potency of small molecules binding to their molecular targets. We will build on our foundational work by using deep learning to simultaneously solving the scoring and sampling problems, which will overcome scalability limitations inherent in current approaches.  We propose to develop the ﬁrst deep generative models for structure-based drug design. Unlike tra- ditional screening, generative modeling is not limited to a predeﬁned chemical space. In generative mod- eling, a deep neural network learns an underlying distribution of molecular structures and properties represented as a latent space. New structures can be extracted from this learned latent space to have desirable properties. Ideally, a generative model will produce novel, near-optimal molecular structures almost instantaneously. We hypothesize that training generative models using existing 3D protein and ligand structures will allow us to create general models that can be productively applied to new, struc- turally enabled targets due to the richness and universality of protein-ligand interactions. We will further develop these methods to support the generation of optimized lead candidates, where the generative process is updated to include results from experimental assays as the drug discovery process progresses.  We will continually apply our methods to identify small molecule modulators of molecular interac- tions relevant to normal physiology and disease. For example, using our current tools, we identiﬁed the ﬁrst inhibitors of the proﬁlin-actin interaction, an anti-angiogenesis target with relevance to cancer and diabetic retinopathy, and we plan to further improve these compounds with the goal of identifying candi- dates for clinical testing. We will apply our methods to address other under-explored molecular targets, such as NFATc2, which is implicated in cancer and autoimmune diseases. These prospective applications of our methods will provide unbiased and realistic evaluations that further inform their development.  Finally, all of our code and trained deep neural network models will be deployed either as new tools for generative modeling or as enhancements to our widely used open source tools for computational drug discovery: (1) PHARMIT, an interactive web application for structure-based drug discovery; (2) GNINA, a C/C++ deep learning framework for molecular docking; and (3) the newly released LIBMOLGRID, a Python library for accelerated molecular gridding that integrates with popular deep learning toolkits. These tools and methods will make the drug discovery process more accessible and efﬁcient. Project Narrative  The research supported by this award will develop new computational methods and tools for drug discovery so that novel therapeutics can be discovered more quickly and with less expense.

"National Drug Early Warning System Coordinating Center PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our team enthusiastically submits this proposal to be the next NDEWS Coordinating Center (CC) in response to RFA DA-20-016. The CC is spearheaded by the Cottler Lab (Epidemiology), with investigators from University of Florida's Center for Addiction Research & Education (Nixon, Goldberger, Striley), the Palamar Lab at New York University and the Machine Perception and Cognitive Robotics Lab-Barenholtz) at Florida Atlantic University. Our CC will maintain strong sentinel surveillance efforts while expanding our Early Warning Network sites, adding leading edge indicators that extend beyond lagged city-level data. We will extend the work of NIDA-funded researchers, while harmonizing and analyzing data, with timely and systematic notifications. The new NDEWS CC will work to seamlessly transition on-going efforts, advance methods and approaches, establish and engage a Scientific Advisory Group (SAG), and collaborate with all consortium components to accomplish these Specific Aims: 1) Provide an Early Warning Network of 12 NDEWS sites and 6 Community Epidemiology Workgroup sites for ongoing surveillance of urban, rural, and suburban areas; 2) Utilize established and new key community-level indicators for ongoing surveillance to assess trends in availability, use, and consequences of NPS and known substances, standardized across all sites to facilitate cross-site analyses; 3) Incorporate and leverage novel surveillance methods to ensure early detection of signals of NPS and emerging drug trends, including data from DanceSafe “drug checkers,” Rapid Street Reporting (RSR) with hair testing for NPS exposure, the implementation of a virtual HealthStreet substance user network, and development of an innovative machine learning approach to detect emergence of NPS in real-time through drug retailers (including the “darknet”) and social media platforms; 4) Harmonize standardized indicator definitions for all incoming surveillance data with the input of NIDA, the SAG, and Early Warning Network experts; facilitate cross-site comparability of data; manage quality control; organize, coordinate, and summarize data, and provide organizational and logistical support; 5) Disseminate findings quickly via dashboards modeled after Florida Drug-related Outcomes Surveillance and Tracking System (FROST); push notifications for regular updates and alerts; webinars; virtual Our Community Our Health Town Hall meetings; and traditionally through official reports, peer-reviewed publications, media, and annual reporting at CPDD, and elsewhere; 6) Conduct on-the-ground epidemiologic investigations on topics of immediate crisis or need; 7) Provide operational, administrative, and logistical support to the enterprise and NIDA; and 8) Train the next generation of scientists in NDEWS methodology.  NDEWS has unrealized potential, and with this funding, we will transform the culture so that NDEWS is NIDA's and the field's go-to source for drug trends in the US.

"Mechanism-Driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway Modeling for Hepatotoxicity PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Experimental animal and clinical testing to evaluate hepatotoxicity demands extensive resources and long turnaround times. Utilization of computational models to directly predict the toxicity of new compounds is a promising strategy to reduce the cost of drug development and to screen the multitude of industrial chemicals and environmental contaminants currently lacking safety assessments. However, the current computational models for complex toxicity endpoints, such as hepatotoxicity, are not reliable for screening new compounds and face numerous challenges. Our recent studies have shown that traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship modeling is applicable for relatively simple properties or toxicity endpoints with a clear mechanism, but fails to address complex bioactivities such as hepatotoxicity. The primary objective of this proposal is to develop novel mechanism-driven Virtual Adverse Outcome Pathway (vAOP) models for the fast and accurate assessment of hepatotoxicity in a high-throughput manner The resulting vAOP models will be experimentally validated using a complement of in vitro and ex vivo testing. We have generated a preliminary vAOP model based on the antioxidant response element (ARE) pathway that has undergone initial validation and refinement using in vitro testing. To this end, our project will generate novel predictive models for hepatotoxicity by applying 1) a virtual cellular stress pathway model to mechanism profiling and assessment of new compounds; 2) computational predictions to fill in the missing data for specific targets within the pathway; 3) in vitro experimental validation with three complementary bioassays; and 4) ex vivo experimental validation with pooled primary human hepatocytes capable of biochemical transformation. The scientific approach of this study is to develop a universal modeling workflow that can take advantage of all available short-term testing information, obtained from both computational predictions using novel machine learning approaches and in vitro experiments, for target compounds of interest. We will validate and use our modeling workflow to directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity of new compounds and prioritize candidates for validation in pooled primary human hepatocytes. The resulting workflow will be disseminated via a web portal for public users around the world with internet access. Importantly, this study will pave the way for the next generation of chemical toxicity assessment by reconstructing the modeling process through a combination of big data, computational modeling, and low cost in vitro experiments. To the best of our knowledge, the implementation of this project will lead to the first publicly available mechanisms-driven modeling and web- based prediction framework for complex chemical toxicity based on publicly-accessible big data. These deliverables will have a significant public health impact by not only prioritizing compounds for safety testing or new chemical development, but also revealing toxicity mechanisms. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hepatotoxicity is a leading safety concern in the development of new chemicals. We will create virtual “Adverse Outcome Pathway” models that will directly evaluate the hepatotoxicity potentials of chemicals using massive public toxicity data.

"Advancing Drug Repositioning for Alzheimer’s Disease using Real-world Data Project Summary: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and AD-related dementias (ADRD) is the 6th leading cause of death affecting about 5.7 million Americans. Generally, one in five women and one in ten men are expected to develop AD/ADRD; and the number of people living with AD/ADRD is expected to grow to 14 million in the next two decades. The quality of life of AD/ADRD patients is gradually diminished and caring for AD/ADRD patients imposes tremendous emotional and financial burden on family caregivers, communities, and healthcare systems. However, up until now, there is no cure and not even effective treatment for AD/ADRD patients, probably due to the complex mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of AD/ADRD. As drug development is becoming increasingly expensive and time-consuming (with estimated cost from $648 million8 to $2.5 billion9 and an average of 9-12 years for new drugs), drug repurposing, aiming to discover new uses of existing drugs, is one potential solution to speed up the drug development for AD/ADRD. However, previous attempts on drug repurposing for AD/ADRD based on omics data have not been successful so far, indicating that animal models may not translate to humans as readily as hoped. New methods that can speed up drug development for AD/ADRD are needed. In this study, we propose to detect drugs that can be potentially repurposed for AD/ADRD using 4 unique EHR data sets. This study will address the critical challenges of EHR-based drug repurposing including incomplete patient’s information and misclassification error associated bias. Aim 1 will focus on a drug repurposing knowledgebase for AD/ADRD, natural language processing methods to extract risk factors from clinical narratives, and phenotyping algorithms to accurately identify MCI and AD/ADRD patients to support the patient cohort construction. In Aim 2, we will develop drug repurposing methods that account for the high-dimensional of risk factors and misclassification error associated bias and apply them to detect drug repurposing signals using large collections of EHRs from (1) the OneFlorida network (2) the Cerner Health Facts database, (3) EHR from physician practice at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, and (4) EHR data from the University of Pennsylvania. In Aim 3, we propose to validate the top-ranked signals through a prospective cohort study. We will recruit patients and routinely collect detailed pragmatic information and genotypes to validate the efficacy of the identified drug signals. The success of our study will: (1) produce a knowledgebase with timely updated risk factors, biomarkers, genotypes, and drug signals for AD/ADRD, (2) develop an open- source drug repurposing package - RAIDER (Repurposing Alzheimer Impacting Drugs using Electronic health Records) for AD/ADRD, and (3) generate drug repurposing signals validated in a prospective cohort study, which will inform the design of future large-scale national trials for AD/ADRD.

"Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging our therapeutic strategies. Drug resistance occurs as a result of this evolution when drug pressure changes the balance of molecular recognition events, selectively weakening inhibitor binding while maintaining the biological function of the therapeutic target. Disrupting the therapeutic target’s activity is necessary but not sufficient to avoid resistance. We hypothesize that the multi-dimensional landscape of resistance evolution can be elucidated through integration of experimental and computational data to reveal the key pathways and coupled molecular mechanisms to resistance. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this strategy can be incorporated into structure-based drug design to evaluate novel inhibitors.  Resistance occurs under gradual and persistent drug pressure, and interestingly the mutations are not limited to the active site of a drug target, but can occur throughout the enzyme to confer high levels of resistance. The molecular mechanism by which this resistance occurs is not clear. Our aim is to exploit the rich and versatile experimental data, integrating inhibitor potency and crystallographic structures with ensemble dynamics in an internally consistent manner using machine learning to elucidate both the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance and generate predictive models of inhibitor potency. Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design Many of the most deadly diseases that plague our society evolve quickly, challenging our therapeutic strategies. Drug resistance occurs as a result of this evolution when drug pressure changes the balance of molecular recognition events, selectively weakening inhibitor binding while maintaining the biological function of the therapeutic target. We hypothesize that the multi- dimensional landscape of resistance evolution can be elucidated through integration of experimental and computational data to reveal the key pathways and coupled molecular mechanisms to resistance and thereby advance drug design.",Integration of Evolution to Avoid Resistance in Structure Based Drug Design,10256048,R01GM135919,"['Active Sites', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dihydrofolate Reductase', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug resistance', 'Enzyme Inhibitor Drugs', 'Enzymes', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'HIV', 'HIV-1 protease', 'Human', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Oncology', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phosphotransferases', 'Plague', 'Protease Inhibitor', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resistance profile', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Variant', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'base', 'bcr-abl Fusion Proteins', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular recognition', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'resistance mechanism', 'resistance mutation', 'supervised learning', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,599223
"Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis Project Summary Clinical trials are foundational to evidence-based medicine, but results reporting from trials is incomplete and frequently delayed. It is estimated that as many as half of clinical trials are not published and as many as half of published trials underreport or misreport outcomes. This type of results reporting distorts the evidence available to clinicians—particularly when it comes to assessing the safety of interventions like drugs and devices—and may place patients at unnecessary risk. There is a critical need for novel methods to identify and monitor drug safety data. Through the infrastructure provided by ClinicalTrials.gov, structured trial results (including safety findings) are now becoming available for an increasing number of trials in a comprehensive and timely fashion. However, access and use of these data in evidence synthesis tasks remain limited. ClinicalTrials.gov is the largest single registry for clinical studies worldwide and includes more than 260,000 registered studies. Of the 108,941 completed trials registered with the site, 20% have uploaded results data for a total of 7.85 million participants. Results data reported on ClinicalTrials.gov have the potential to fill gaps created by delays and biases in published articles and provide an earlier and more complete overview of available trial evidence. We propose to develop novel informatics approaches based on combinations of information retrieval and machine learning methods to facilitate access and analysis of trial results reported in this registry. Focusing on trials testing drug interventions in type 2 diabetes, obesity, and oncology, we perform this work in three specific aims: 1) Develop semi-automated trial screening for identifying and aggregating trials relevant to a clinical intervention; 2) Extract adverse event and safety outcomes data from results reported in the registry; and 3) Perform validation studies to assess detection of adverse events and performance of semi- automated meta-analyses of safety outcomes. Methods developed in this project will facilitate timely, broad- scale use of trial results reported on ClinicalTrials.gov in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data. All methods will be made publicly available in order to support adverse event monitoring and systematic reviews of drug interventions. Project Narrative The availability of results from clinical trials is frequently incomplete or delayed, limiting the evidence available to clinicians making treatment decisions. When results on the safety of interventions, such as drugs, are not properly disseminated, patients may be exposed to harm. National policies require comprehensive and timely reporting of trial results in trial registries (e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov), representing a novel data type that could be used for drug safety surveillance. However, the use of these data has remained limited to date. We propose innovative informatics methods to enable access and analysis of this emerging data source in order to augment the availability of comprehensive and timely drug safety data.",Coupling Results Data from ClinicalTrials.gov and Bibliographic Databases to Accelerate Evidence Synthesis,10136717,R01LM012976,"['Adverse drug event', 'Adverse event', 'Bibliographic Databases', 'Bibliography', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Consumption', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug usage', 'Equilibrium', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Retrieval', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Obesity', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Policies', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Rofecoxib', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'Validation', 'Work', 'adverse event monitoring', 'base', 'cluster trial', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'drug testing', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medication safety', 'novel', 'rosiglitazone', 'safety outcomes', 'screening', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'trial design', 'validation studies', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,328000
"A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis PROJECT SUMMARY This project will address the critical need for new and effective antitubercular drugs. Our primary objective is to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mycobacterium tuberculosis tolerates antitubercular drug treatment. Our motivating hypothesis is that M. tuberculosis tolerates drug induced stress by differentially regulating detoxification enzymes, efflux pumps, metabolic activity, pellicle-forming factors, and cell wall remodeling systems. Further, we postulate that a secondary drug targeting one or few regulators of these tolerance strategies will potentiate the primary drug-treatment, and potentially reduce the emergence of resistance. We propose a systems biology approach to generate a network perspective of drug-induced tolerance mechanisms and how they are coordinated by one or few regulators that could be targeted for overcoming drug-specific tolerance using combinatorial treatment regimens. Hence, the innovation of our proposed research emerges from integrating network characterization of drug- specific tolerance mechanisms into the rational discovery of novel drug combinations. In Aim 1, we will transcriptionally profile M. tuberculosis following treatment with ten selected drugs (primary drugs). Using techniques developed in our laboratory, differentially expressed genes will be mapped onto a systems-scale gene regulatory network model of M. tuberculosis to infer drug-specific tolerance sub-networks and elucidate key regulators. We will also identify tolerance sub-networks by generating genome-wide fitness profiles in the presence of the selected primary drugs. Drug-associated fitness defects will reveal genes that are important for dealing with drug-induced stress and are hypothesized to cluster together in drug-specific tolerance sub-networks. In Aim 2, we will transcriptionally profile ~250 secondary drugs and perform combination high-throughput screens of all primary and secondary drug combinations. Data from these studies will be used to iteratively refine the model and develop a machine learning algorithm to identify gene- and network-level features that are predictive of synergistic drug interactions. Finally, mechanism of synergistic drug combinations will be characterized by selectively perturbing the predicted regulators of the tolerance sub-networks. This project will propel the development of systems biology tools to accurately predict novel synergistic drug combinations, thereby guiding experimental assessment and accelerating the delivery of new treatments to patients with tuberculosis infection. PROJECT NARRATIVE Treatment of tuberculosis infection (responsible for 1.5 million deaths annually) is complicated by the impermeable cell wall structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its intrinsic ability to adapt and withstand drug treatment, a phenomenon called tolerance. Thus, an urgent goal of antitubercular drug discovery is to overcome drug tolerance. This project will deepen our understanding of how M. tuberculosis responds to and thereby tolerates drug treatment and will use this systems-scale understanding to develop a predictive framework for identifying new synergistically acting drug combinations for the treatment of tuberculosis.",A systems analysis of drug tolerance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis,10059161,R01AI128215,"['Address', 'Antitubercular Agents', 'Cell Wall', 'Cessation of life', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Metabolic Detoxication', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Targeting', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Enzymes', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Analysis', 'Systems Biology', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Tuberculosis', 'combinatorial', 'differential expression', 'drug discovery', 'efflux pump', 'fitness', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput screening', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'network models', 'novel', 'novel drug combination', 'response', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transposon sequencing', 'treatment response', 'tuberculosis drugs', 'tuberculosis treatment']",NIAID,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,R01,2021,913527
"Social Media Mining for Pharmacovigilance Project Summary Drugs undergo extensive testing in animals and clinical trials in humans before they are marketed for widespread use. Pre-market testing produces reasonably high quality information about the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the condition for which it was approved, but gives a very incomplete picture of the drug's safety. It is only after a drug is marketed and used on a more widespread basis over longer periods of time that it is possible to identify other effects, such as rare but serious adverse effects, or those that are more common in the special subgroups excluded from the trial (such as pregnant women), or effects of long-term use of the drug, among others. Despite the increase in research in the past years exploring social media data for pharmacovigilance, and the evidence that it indeed can bring forward the patient perspective, there is no systematic approach to collect and annotate such data for research purposes.

"Compound repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease using knowledge graphs, insurance claims data, and gene expression complementarity PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal focuses on the challenge of identifying drug repositioning candidates for Alzheimer’s Disease. The foundation of this work is the ReFRAME library, a set of ~13,000 compounds that includes nearly all small molecules that have been FDA-approved, reached clinical development, or undergone significant preclinical profiling. The ReFRAME library is being actively screened against a diverse cross-section of in vitro assays. This proposal pursues three distinct strategies for identifying repositioning candidates among the ReFRAME collection. First, we will create and mine a large and heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph. We will use machine learning methods to identify repositioning candidates based on properties of the knowledge graph surrounding and joining each drug and disease. Second, we will mine a massive data set of insurance claims data for associations between drug use and the incidence or severity of Alzheimer’s Disease. Containing almost 7 billion medical claims and over 2 billion pharmacy claims, this data set represents the largest source of claims data available. Third, we will use concept of gene expression complementarity to identify repositioning candidates. We will generate a gene expression signature for every ReFRAME compound in three cell lines relevant to Alzheimer’s Disease, and we will screen for compounds that produce a signature that appear to reverse gene expression changes seen in Alzheimer’s Disease. After assembling repositioning candidates identified through all three of these methods, we will prioritize up to 100 compounds (or compound combinations) for further characterization and validation. These follow-up experiments will initially investigate the activity of these compounds in five cell-based assays to establish a mechanistic hypothesis on their mechanism of action in Alzheimer’s Disease. Secondary follow-up experiments may include validation in some combination of in vitro (including hiPSC-derived cerebrocortical neurons and/or organoids) and in vivo systems. We believe that the multifaceted approach described in this proposal offers the best possible chance at successfully identifying AD repositioning candidates. Moreover, this work will create methods and resources that will be useful to the broader scientific community, both for Alzheimer’s Disease and for other disease areas. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project focuses on discovering new treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease. We specifically are looking for drugs that are already approved (or were previously tested) to treat other diseases to see if they can be beneficial for Alzheimer’s Disease patients. We will make and test predictions about which chemical compounds will have benefit, either alone or in combination.","Compound repositioning for Alzheimer's Disease using knowledge graphs, insurance claims data, and gene expression complementarity",10137167,R01AG066750,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease diagnosis', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Area', 'Biological Assay', 'Blue Cross', 'Blue Shield', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'FDA approved', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Neurons', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical development', 'cost', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'insurance claims', 'interest', 'knowledge graph', 'machine learning method', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical development', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'symposium', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'trend', 'validation studies']",NIA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,886543
"Platform for high-throughput biomechanical measurements using metallic islands on boron nitride nanosheets SUMMARY This proposal describes a new platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical phenomena in cells. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride. Mechanical deformation produces a change in both the electrical resistance and the optical scattering of these sensors. These processes allow the detection of deformations ≤1 ppm (≤0.0001% strain). This unprecedented level of sensitivity permits the measurement of minute forces produced by cells that cannot be measured using existing methods, and the electrical signals can be analyzed rapidly using machine-learning algorithms. While this sensor has a broad range of potential applications in cell biology, we apply it here to a ubiquitous challenge in cardiovascular medicine and drug discovery. In particular, contractile dysfunction in cardiomyocytes is associated with a range of difficult-to-treat cardiomyopathies. In drug discovery, cardiotoxicity (myopathy, arrhythmia, or both) is a leading reason for the failure of drugs during development and aftermarket launch. For some classes of drugs—especially those used in chemotherapy—up to 30% of patients experience heart disease related to their treatment. Indeed, heart failure is the second most common reason for death of cancer patients. There are currently no assays that are both predictive of cardiotoxicity and are of sufficient throughput to implement early in drug development (i.e., when safer drug leads can be selected among analogues). We propose the use of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) bearing various disease-associated mutations as a test case of our nano-enabled biomechanical sensor. In particular, we will construct an array based on a “96-well” plate format combined with high-throughput analysis using a purpose-designed machine learning algorithm in order to measure the forces and kinetics of contractility of the cells. Such a platform would enable large-scale evaluation of disease mechanisms and accelerate therapeutic target discovery by permitting high-throughput, unbiased testing. This application offers the exciting possibility of introducing aspects of the biology of the human heart early in the discovery pipeline. More broadly, the platform we describe offers the potential of answering deep questions about mechanical phenomena in cells—“the mechanome”—which play critical roles in human health. NARRATIVE This proposal describes a platform for high-throughput measurement of mechanical forces in cells, which play major roles in human health. The platform is based on a type of strain sensor comprising metallic nanoislands supported by hexagonal boron nitride.

"Combined Cardiomyopathy, e.g., of Cancer Chemotherapeutics, and Proarrhythmia for Cardiotoxicity Clinical Trials-in-a-Dish (CTiD) with iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes Cardiotoxicity is a leading cause of drug discovery attrition across all of preclinical and clinical drug discovery. While the FDA and the Comprehensive in vitro Proarrhythmia Assay initiative (CiPA) are focused primarily on predicting proarrhythmic effects, drug attrition due to cardiomyopathy, or primary cardiac cytotoxicity, may be even more prevalent, is typically currently only carried out via animal studies, and limits dosage for many cancer chemotherapeutics. Due to improving cancer survival, it is increasing common for more cancer survivors of some cancer types to die of cardiac diseases due to cancer treatment side effects than cancer recurrence. Cardiac contractions are initiated by electrical depolarizations (action potentials, APs) that propagate through the heart and initiate calcium (Ca2+) transients that activate the contractile apparatus. Importantly, dysregulation of Ca2+ can trigger inappropriate early-after- and delayed-after- depolarizations (EADs and DADs) that initiate arrhythmias, inhibit mitochondrial function, and pathologically alter expression of contractile proteins. Chemotherapy and other drugs can also directly impair mitochondrial function, which is primarily thought to cause cytotoxicity, but can also cause arrhythmias. Cardiomyocytes are also heterogeneous in their voltage, calcium, and contractile functions, and in their responses to therapeutic candidates. Thus, it is highly desirable to simultaneously measure AP, Ca2+ and contractile function on a cell- by-cell basis, in human cardiomyocytes, but this is not possible with current test methods. To address this unmet need we propose to develop a high throughput (robotic) Kinetic Image Cytometry that simultaneously quantifes voltage, calcium, and contractile motion in cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs). The hiPSC-CMs will be labeled with fluorescent indicators of calcium and voltage, and the cells imaged via high-speed automated microscopy during contractile activity. The use of hiPSC-CMs will enable “clinical trials” in a dish, in which test compounds are tested across cells representing several donors. Phase I of this Fast-Track STTR project will develop the basic protocol and perform a proof-of-concept screen of 30 test compounds on hiPSC-CMs representing 5 donors. In Phase II, a large validation study (~350 compounds, 7-concentration dose-response, 30 min and 72 hr exposures) will be performed. Artificial intelligence will be utilized to optimize the sensitivity and specificity of the assay by detecting complex arrhythmia waveforms. This assay represents a human-based preclinical model that will be less expensive and more predictive for cardiotoxicity testing than animal models and will be marketed to the pharmaceutical industry for contract research. FDA guidelines stipulate that all new drugs be tested for dangerous side-effects on the heart as part of preclinical research; however, the current tests are poorly predictive of both dangerous and safe drugs leading to unwarranted attrition and dangerous drugs reaching clinic. Human cardiomyocytes derived from donor tissue (iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes) are widely considered to hold great promise for clinical trial in a dish studies of drug cardiotoxicity. This STTR proposal is to commercialize a high throughput platform to accurately identify drug candidates that have cardiac side effects, in particular adding the ability to detect the type of primary heart cell damage common with anti-cancer drugs in a fully automated (high throughput) robotic assay for the first time, to improve the efficiency of preclinical research and the safety of human clinical trials, which will also likely have the added benefit of reducing animal research.","Combined Cardiomyopathy, e.g., of Cancer Chemotherapeutics, and Proarrhythmia for Cardiotoxicity Clinical Trials-in-a-Dish (CTiD) with iPSC-Derived Cardiomyocytes",10268102,R42HL158510,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Aging', 'American', 'Animal Experimentation', 'Animal Model', 'Animal Testing', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Assay', 'Calcium', 'Cancer Survivor', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Contract Services', 'Contractile Proteins', 'Dangerousness', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Drug Industry', 'Female', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Cytometry', 'Impairment', 'In Vitro', 'Kinetics', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Mitochondria', 'Motion', 'Myocardium', 'Myopathy', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality Control', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Contracts', 'Risk Assessment', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sales', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum', 'Science', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology Transfer', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Donors', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'anti-cancer therapeutic', 'base', 'calcium indicator', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer survival', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cell injury', 'cellular imaging', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical predictors', 'compound 30', 'cost', 'cytotoxicity', 'dosage', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'drug testing', 'heart cell', 'high throughput screening', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'insight', 'instrument', 'lead series', 'male', 'novel therapeutics', 'pre-clinical', 'pre-clinical research', 'response', 'scale up', 'screening', 'side effect', 'therapeutic candidate', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies', 'voltage']",NHLBI,"VALA SCIENCES, INC.",R42,2021,299871
