"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9983413,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mortality risk', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic patients', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",K01,2019,190216,0.23468128602228486
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Advances in acute care have decreased short-term mortality of sepsis, resulting in an increasing number of survivors who experience significant morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infections account for 60% of hospital readmissions after sepsis and are an important cause of long-term mortality. Identifying sepsis survivors at risk for infections and understanding predisposing factors are therefore important first steps to develop personalized interventions to improve long-term outcomes. The overall research goal is to develop innovative targeted interventions to improve long-term outcomes after sepsis. This proposal focuses on identifying subgroups of sepsis survivors (phenotypes) at high risk for infection-related hospital readmissions and deaths. It is hypothesized that the combination of host factors, disease characteristics, and interventions prior to and during sepsis will identify distinct phenotypes that are captured by clinical data. These clinical phenotypes likely have distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms (e.g., immunosuppression), predispose to different outcomes (e.g., recurrent infections), and patients with the same phenotype may respond similarly to targeted interventions such as immunomodulation. In Aim 1, three nationally representative datasets of sepsis survivors will be assembled and analyzed by machine learning techniques to identify valid clinical sepsis phenotypes. In Aim 2, phenotypes at high-risk for infection-related readmissions and deaths at 6 months will be identified, and underlying biomarker profiles for these phenotypes analyzed. In Aim 3, these high-risk phenotypes will be used to conceptualize and simulate an adaptive platform trial designed to test the efficacy of three different immunomodulatory drugs. An adaptive trial design was chosen, because it can test multiple interventions simultaneously and reduces the chances of exposing patients to ineffective or harmful interventions. The research plan is augmented by expert mentoring and rigorous didactic training. Together, this will provide the candidate with essential career development skills in the science of precision medicine, including machine learning methodologies, Bayesian statistics, and innovate clinical trial design. This proposal has potentially groundbreaking implications for the future treatment of sepsis survivors, because it deviates from the current âone-size fits allâ approach and attempts to create the framework for personalized interventions. This framework sets the stage for future independent investigator (RO1) applications evaluating personalized treatments in adaptive clinical trials, and will uniquely position the candidate as a future leader in the field of long-term outcomes after critical illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is important for public health because sepsis is a life-threatening infection that affects 30 million people worldwide each year. Long-term outcomes for patients who survive a hospital admission for sepsis are poor, and many patients develop new disabilities or worsening of preexisting health conditions. This proposal supports the NIHâs mission to enhance health and reduce illness and disability by trying to identify interventions for sepsis survivors at highest risk for poor outcomes.",A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors,9718511,K23GM132688,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Interleukin-7', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'PDCD1LG1 gene', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Recombinants', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Sepsis', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'response', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'trial design']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2019,189327,0.26096157345093796
"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design.Â The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.Â  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis.Â ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9626417,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'septic patients', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2019,616807,0.22492729893790253
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",9807677,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Comorbidity', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2019,79000,0.14155679122304135
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the âAutomated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsisâ study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9650623,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical predictors', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2019,535600,0.23847842030077754
"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidateâs career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response.

"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3â6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6â8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, ânote bloatâ, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9693333,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2019,646418,0.0540086376251248
"Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Sepsis Induced Multiple Organ Failure Renewal Carcillo R01 Project Abstract Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call âsepsisâ, and death in up to 1 of 3 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). National efforts emphasizing early recognition, intravenous fluids to help organs, and antibiotics to kill infection, have reduced mortality so that now 1 of 4 die. We and others have asked the question âwhy do patients continue to die despite these national efforts?â In the previous funding period we showed in 401 children with sepsis that those who developed organ shut down despite these efforts, did so because they were a) unable to fight germs causing unending infection, b) unable to stop clotting off their body causing kidney failure, and/or c) unable to kill viruses causing liver failure; all of which led to death from uncontrolled inflammation with clotting, bleeding and liver failure. Fortunately, each of these organ shutdown groups has hopeful treatments. With the new information we collected in the previous funding period we have already designed and started clinical trials testing these treatments including immune boosters for children unable to kill germs, plasma removal and replacement using plasma exchange for children unable to stop clotting, monoclonal antibodies to kill viruses and their homes to reverse liver failure in children unable to do so on their own, and anti-inflammatory proteins to reverse uncontrollable inflammation, in hopes of helping save many of the 1 of 4 children still dying from sepsis related organ shutdown. In this next funding period, we propose to use the clinical information and samples already obtained in our previous study to take advantage of the wonderful advances made this millenia in computer technology, big data, bioinformatics, and the study of human and virus genetics to perform Specific Aim 1) use a âWatsonâ like approach to ask the computer to help us figure out if the children with sepsis have any other causes of organ shutdown that we can help, Specific Aim 2) use an âAncestry.comâ-like or â23 and meâ-like approach to identify âprecision medicineâ therapies for causes of organ shutdown that we can treat on a patient by patient basis, and Specific Aim 3) use a bedside molecular biology test approach to identify individualized therapies to kill DNA viruses and reduce cytokine inflammation. We think that DNA viruses are the unappreciated co-infection which causes uncontrolled cytokine inflammation and leads to organ shutdown. Our long term objective is to plan âprecisionâ medicine and âindividualizedâ medicine clinical trials testing therapies on an individual patient basis in order to further reduce death from sepsis organ shutdown in children.

"Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record Project Summary/Abstract Sepsis is a critical illness syndrome characterized by infection leading to life-threatening organ failure. Affecting over 200,000 individuals in the United States each year, sepsis accounts for nearly half of all hospital deaths and over $20 billion in yearly US hospital costs. Despite the development and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines, most patients with sepsis do not consistently receive recommended care, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is increasing interest in implementing health policies designed to incentivize quality improvement at the hospital level. The largest and most prominent of these policies to date is the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) quality reporting initiative, known as SEP-1. SEP-1 requires hospitals to report their compliance with a variety of evidence-based care processes, including timely antibiotic administration, timely volume resuscitation, and routine monitoring of the clinical response to therapy. SEP-1 is unique among quality measures in the CMS Inpatient Quality Reporting Program, both because it is the only measure based on a critical illness syndrome and because it is of unparalleled complexity, requiring the coordinated efforts of multiple health care providers across the acute care spectrum. As a consequence, it is essential to understand how SEP-1 has affected patient care and clinical outcomes. To address this need, we propose to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the SEP-1 measure using the electronic health record (EHR) of a large multihospital health system. An EHR-based approach will allow us to understand the impact of the policy in exceptional detail, yielding actionable data not only for policy makers seeking to refine SEP-1 but also for health systems seeking to respond to SEP-1 in a way that maximizes the potential benefits. First, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis recognition and documentation using natural language processing of clinical notes. Second, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis care processes using structured data elements such as vital signs, laboratory values, and medication administration. Third, we will evaluate the impact of the program on patient mortality, length of stay, and requirement for organ support. In all aims we will examine both overall effects and hospital-specific effects, providing an understanding of how hospitals and health systems implement quality improvement in the context of a novel reporting mandate. Together, these aims will yield important new insights into how clinicians and hospitals implement new quality reporting programs. At the same time, through a program of structured mentorship, career development, and stakeholder involvement, this project will provide the principal investigator with new skills in the use of the EHR to evaluate health care quality and the impact of system-level health policies, uniquely positioning him to lead future efforts to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate EHR-based performance interventions for critically ill patients. NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection and accounts for significant morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs in the United States. In this proposal, we will use data from the electronic health record of a large health system to evaluate the effects of a novel sepsis quality reporting program on sepsis recognition, treatment, and outcomes. Our findings will yield important early information on the quality reporting programâs impact, helping to guide policy makers as they seek to refine the program and yielding novel insights into strategies to improve sepsis quality in US hospitals.",Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record,9731455,K08HS025455,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K08,2019,148308,0.2083055227051295
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial. This proposal responds to the AHRQ priorities of improving health care quality through use of information systems, improving safety and quality of care by synthesizing and communicating evidence to health care professionals, advances knowledge generation in a learning health system and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs.",Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED),9747879,K08HS025696,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K08,2019,148539,0.16880793272727707
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9538699,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic patients', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,190216,0.23468128602228486
"Using clinical treatment data in a machine learning approach for sepsis detection Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to develop novel software, âHindSightâ, that will improve InSight, a machine-learning based clinical decision support (CDS) system for sepsis prediction and detection. HindSight will identify cliniciansâ sepsis-related decisions in the records of former patients; it will then use these events to supply InSight with labeled examples of sepsis cases, incorporating cliniciansâ judgement to demonstrate appropriate and inappropriate alarms. Together with an online training module that accordingly refines InSightâs predictors, this capability will enable InSight to quickly adapt to the idiosyncrasies of a particular clinical deployment, reduce false or irrelevant alarms, and do both without explicit human supervision. Research Question: Can a machine-learning-based, retrospective labeler learn to autonomously label sepsis and sepsis treatments by integrating the total clinical record, thereby providing many high-quality examples and labels for training a sepsis CDS? In concert with an online learning algorithm, can this labeler facilitate online, supervised learning without explicit human intervention? Prior Work: We have developed InSight for application in a number of sepsis prediction settings. Existing InSight classifiers attain an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 for sepsis detection, and 0.74 for 4-hour early sepsis prediction. Specific Aims: To identify patients who were evaluated for sepsis, treated for sepsis, or who actually had sepsis using the retrospective clinical patient record and label them accordingly (Aim 1); to use these labels with an online learning algorithm to implement autonomous, supervised learning of alert behavior which reflects clinician judgement (Aim 2). Methods: We will identify evaluated, treated, and septic patients using a machine learning labeler trained on retrospective data from patientsâ electronic health records (EHR) at time of discharge. Using a set of 100 test cases (â¥ 20 septic) hand-annotated by our clinician investigators, we will assess the labelerâs performance. Labeling AUROC â¥ 0.95 will constitute success in Aim 1. We will develop an online learning algorithm which enables InSight to continuously retrain during deployment. With Aim 1âs labeler, we will simulate a deployment with online learning, producing a learning curve of predictive AUROC on a held-out test set versus number of observed patients. Aim 2 will be successful if the online training results in superior area under the learning curve versus the initial model and periodic retraining. All experiments will be executed using the MIMIC-III data set. Future Directions: Following the proposed work, the InSight system with an online, HindSight-based retraining module will be deployed at partner hospitals for prospective studies. Narrative Clinical decision support (CDS) systems present critical information to medical professionals by examining patient data and providing alerts. Machine learning is a powerful method for creating CDS tools, but it requires labels which reflect the desired alert behavior. We will develop software that examines discharged patientsâ electronic health records (EHR), identifies cliniciansâ sepsis treatment decisions and patient outcomes, and passes these labeled examples to an online algorithm for retraining InSight, our machine-learning-based CDS tool for real-time sepsis prediction.",Using clinical treatment data in a machine learning approach for sepsis detection,9557659,R43TR002309,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Drops', 'E-learning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Hand', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pythons', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Supervision', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Survival Rate', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'TensorFlow', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'research clinical testing', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'software development', 'success', 'support tools']",NCATS,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,324971,0.21185083520548575

"A computational approach to early sepsis detection Abstract Significance: In this SBIR project, we propose to improve the performance of InSight, a machine-learning- based sepsis screening system, in situations of limited training data from the target clinical site. The proposed work will make possible prospective clinical deployments to sites which are smaller or lack clinical data repositories, by significantly reducing the amount of training data necessary down to a few weeks of clinical observation. Classically, a machine-learning-based system like InSight requires complete retraining for each new clinical setting, in turn requiring a new and large collection of data from each target deployment site. We will circumvent this requirement via transfer learning techniques, which transfer knowledge acquired previously in a source clinical setting to a new, target setting. Research Questions: Which transfer learning methods and paired classification algorithms are most suitable for use with InSight, requiring minimal target-site training data while maintaining strong performance? Are these methods and algorithms robust across the several common sepsis-spectrum definitions? Prior Work: We have developed InSight using the MIMIC-III retrospective data set, on which it attains an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.88 for sepsis detection, and 0.74 for 4-hour early sepsis prediction. We have also conducted pilot transfer learning  â¥ experiments in a different clinical task, mortality forecasting, in which transfer learning yields a 10-fold reduction in the amount of target-site training data required to achieve AUROC 0.80. Specific Aims: Aim 1 - to implement and assess side-by-side four diverse transfer learning methods for a retrospective clinical sepsis prediction task, where the source data set is MIMIC-III and the simulated clinical target is a data set drawn from UCSF. Aim 2 - to determine which among the best methods from Aim 1 also provide robust performance when applied to two additional sepsis-spectrum gold standards. Methods: We will prepare implementations of transfer learning methods which use instance transfer, residual learning and/or feature augmentation, kernel length scale transfer, and feature transfer. We will test these methods with applicable classifiers on subsets of the UCSF set, using cross-validation and quantifying discrimination performance in terms of AUROC. The best method/classifier pairs will require no more than 30 examples of septic patients from the target set and attain AUROC superiorities of 0.05 in 0- and 4-hour pre-onset sepsis prediction/detection, relative to the best tested alternative screening systems (Aim 1). The top three pairs will then be tested for robustness to gold standard choice, using septic shock (0- and 4-hour) and SIRS-based sepsis (0-hour) gold standards; in these tests, at least one pair must again attain 0.05 margin of superiority in AUROC versus the alternative screening systems (Aim 2). Future Directions: The results of these experiments will enable InSight to be robustly deployed to diverse clinical sites, yielding high performance without the need for extensive target-site data acquisition. Narrative Clinical decision support (CDS) systems present critical information to medical professionals by examining patient data and providing relevant information. Machine learning is a powerful method for creating CDS tools, but accessing its full strength requires re-training with retrospective data from each target clinical site. We will use transfer learning techniques to dramatically reduce the amount of target-site training data required by InSight, our machine-learning-based CDS tool for sepsis prediction, and empirically evaluate several such methods on a patient data set, using three different sepsis-related gold standards.",A computational approach to early sepsis detection,9557664,R43TR002221,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Collection', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Discrimination', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune response', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Nature', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Side', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'performance site', 'portability', 'prospective', 'screening', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'success', 'support tools']",NCATS,"DASCENA, INC.",R43,2018,310782,0.17832144657797033
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design.Â The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.Â  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis.Â ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9419932,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'septic patients', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2018,623932,0.22492729893790253
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the âAutomated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsisâ study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9418100,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Comorbidity', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2018,551823,0.23847842030077754
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3â6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6â8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, ânote bloatâ, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9678555,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,658716,0.0540086376251248
"Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record Project Summary/Abstract Sepsis is a critical illness syndrome characterized by infection leading to life-threatening organ failure. Affecting over 200,000 individuals in the United States each year, sepsis accounts for nearly half of all hospital deaths and over $20 billion in yearly US hospital costs. Despite the development and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines, most patients with sepsis do not consistently receive recommended care, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is increasing interest in implementing health policies designed to incentivize quality improvement at the hospital level. The largest and most prominent of these policies to date is the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) quality reporting initiative, known as SEP-1. SEP-1 requires hospitals to report their compliance with a variety of evidence-based care processes, including timely antibiotic administration, timely volume resuscitation, and routine monitoring of the clinical response to therapy. SEP-1 is unique among quality measures in the CMS Inpatient Quality Reporting Program, both because it is the only measure based on a critical illness syndrome and because it is of unparalleled complexity, requiring the coordinated efforts of multiple health care providers across the acute care spectrum. As a consequence, it is essential to understand how SEP-1 has affected patient care and clinical outcomes. To address this need, we propose to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the SEP-1 measure using the electronic health record (EHR) of a large multihospital health system. An EHR-based approach will allow us to understand the impact of the policy in exceptional detail, yielding actionable data not only for policy makers seeking to refine SEP-1 but also for health systems seeking to respond to SEP-1 in a way that maximizes the potential benefits. First, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis recognition and documentation using natural language processing of clinical notes. Second, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis care processes using structured data elements such as vital signs, laboratory values, and medication administration. Third, we will evaluate the impact of the program on patient mortality, length of stay, and requirement for organ support. In all aims we will examine both overall effects and hospital-specific effects, providing an understanding of how hospitals and health systems implement quality improvement in the context of a novel reporting mandate. Together, these aims will yield important new insights into how clinicians and hospitals implement new quality reporting programs. At the same time, through a program of structured mentorship, career development, and stakeholder involvement, this project will provide the principal investigator with new skills in the use of the EHR to evaluate health care quality and the impact of system-level health policies, uniquely positioning him to lead future efforts to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate EHR-based performance interventions for critically ill patients. NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection and accounts for significant morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs in the United States. In this proposal, we will use data from the electronic health record of a large health system to evaluate the effects of a novel sepsis quality reporting program on sepsis recognition, treatment, and outcomes. Our findings will yield important early information on the quality reporting programâs impact, helping to guide policy makers as they seek to refine the program and yielding novel insights into strategies to improve sepsis quality in US hospitals.",Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record,9526083,K08HS025455,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K08,2018,148403,0.2083055227051295
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial. This proposal responds to the AHRQ priorities of improving health care quality through use of information systems, improving safety and quality of care by synthesizing and communicating evidence to health care professionals, advances knowledge generation in a learning health system and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs.",Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED),9595012,K08HS025696,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K08,2018,147838,0.16880793272727707

"Rule-based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Effective Clinical Decision Support (CDS): A Pediatric Severe Sepsis Case Study using ICU Data The recognition, diagnosis, and management of sepsis remain among the greatest challenges in pediatric critical care medicine. The diagnosis of pediatric severe sepsis is particularly challenging since it is time-critical and frequently must rely on clinician interpretation of an equivocal, non-specific, age-dependent constellation of clinical signs and symptoms that occur in association with an infection or other inciting events. Currently available EMR data screening tools designed to identify pediatric severe sepsis using consensus-based guidelines criteria have poor sensitivity/specificity and/or positive predictive value that can result in poor perceived usability. Recent studies show that, in general, sepsis CDS alert fatigue is common, either in the form of false positives or false negatives (e.g. alerting focused on the most severely ill with unequivocal signs of sepsis). As a result such tools are, at best, modestly clinically effective in improving early detection of unrecognized pediatric sepsis and, in infants, can result in antibiotic administration to large numbers of uninfected newborns. We believe significant improvement in CDS usability can only be achieved with a significant improvement in sensitivity/specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) operating at a clinician-specified level of risk. This will require alerting algorithms that leverage the combined analytic power of computerized semantic models (rules, natural language processing) embodied in consensus pediatric sepsis guidelines, pediatric critical care clinician expertise, and retrospective analytics over existing large repositories of clinical encounter data using machine learning algorithms. Late last year we were awarded a SBIR Phase 1 NIH research grant focused on the use of advanced ontological models combined with âbig dataâ predictive analytics/machine learning (ML) techniques over ICU data as a foundation for an adult sepsis CDS. We demonstrated an AUC of 98% and PPV in excess of 85% for our sepsis detection tool for a patient sample of 15,811. We will leverage these results to establish exceptionally sensitive and specific tool that monitors PICU data to accurately predict pediatric patients at risk for impending acute clinical deterioration due to severe sepsis/septic shock. Our goal is to commercially deploy highly useable technology that achieves high levels of clinician acceptance and demonstrably influences timely treatment and pediatric patient outcomes. Our product development concept will employ human factors engineering to achieve highly synchronicity with clinical workflows, combined with a clinician-centered design of the interfaces between our CDS and the institutional pediatric sepsis protocols and EMR data sources. Our product vision is an early sepsis detection CDS with actionable accuracy and usability, compatible with any modern EMR in use at a client hospital, that is effective in reducing pediatric sepsis mortality in both critical and non-critical care settings. Even with the advent of powerful computer system technologies and modern antibiotics/antivirals used in hospitals, one-third of children who die in U.S. tertiary care pediatric intensive care units have severe sepsis. The goal of this research is to develop and validate a real-time pediatric severe sepsis surveillance software system that can be routinely used in conjunction with electronic medical record systems in hospitals to detect early stages of this syndrome. Our approach uses modern artificial intelligence techniques including cognitive reasoning, machine learning and natural language processing to dramatically reduce preventable mortality in hospitalized neonates and children.",Rule-based Semantics and Big Data Based Methods for Effective Clinical Decision Support (CDS): A Pediatric Severe Sepsis Case Study using ICU Data,9254171,R43GM122154,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Case Study', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consensus', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease Progression', 'Dysuria', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Exanthema', 'Fatigue', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune response', 'Infant', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Records', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Newborn Infant', 'Onset of illness', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Parents', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Infant', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Shock', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'adverse outcome', 'age related', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'comparative', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computerized', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disorder risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'neonate', 'patient stratification', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'product development', 'prototype', 'repository', 'screening', 'software systems', 'symposium', 'tertiary care', 'tool', 'trend', 'usability']",NIGMS,"COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2017,147475,0.23062803857945807
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9322197,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intravenous', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk stratification', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'physiologic model', 'portability', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,190216,0.23468128602228486
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design.Â The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.Â  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis.Â ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9239711,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient registry', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2017,735263,0.22492729893790253
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the âAutomated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsisâ study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke.

"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3â6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6â8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, ânote bloatâ, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9284760,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'hospital readmission', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2017,516245,0.0540086376251248
"Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is defined as a severe infection with dangerous physiologic changes, organ dysfunction or death, which hospitalizes over 1.6 million people in the U.S. annually. Sepsis is a priority for the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services due to its healthcare impact, incidence and staggering annual cost, which exceed $20 billion and 5% of all U.S. hospital costs. All sepsis patients, even those with mild sepsis are at risk for in- hospital complications and death, but have improved outcomes if identified early. Sepsis recognition, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneity of patients who may manifest a wide array of clinical presentations. Electronic medical record (EMR) linked computer programs, known as clinical decision support (CDS) tools, have become ubiquitous to assist providers, including identifying sepsis patients. Unfortunately, all CDS tools in the literature miss 20-30% of sepsis patients and frequently misidentify non-sepsis patients as sepsis patients. Inaccurate CDS tools generate far too many false positive alerts, creating the dangerous condition of âalert fatigueâ in which providers become habituated to all alerts, threatening patient safety and even leading to fatal consequences.  The PI and Co-I of this proposal collaboratively developed a CDS software called Sepsis-Alert for adult emergency department (ED) patients. It was fully implemented into Detroit Medical Center's (DMC) EMR live environment and has now been continually operational to provide real-time ongoing monitoring of all ED patients at Sinai Grace Hospital of DMC since October 2014. Our analysis of 25,000 ED visits reveals that while Sepsis-Alert's performance exceeds any reported performance, it still remains unacceptably inaccurate. All the CDS tools, including ours, have two limitations: (1) they lack a mechanism to learn from their past erroneous decisions and consequently repeat the same mistakes again and again, and (2) their decision- making process is fixed and treats all patients in the same way even in face of high heterogeneity of patients,  The main thrust of this research project is to develop an innovative prototype CDS software that functions like Sepsis-Alert but without the two limitations for the same ED sepsis screening purpose. We will develop the software system by utilizing data extracted from the EMR and will test and fine tune the system in over 35,000 retrospective and prospective patients at Sinai Grace Hospital. The proposed prototype, Intelligent Sepsis Alert, will have the cutting edge capabilities of recognizing the subtleties of sepsis, categorizing patients and learning from its own mistakes to avoid repeat them. CDS tools of the future can and must be better. Machine learning is the solution to optimizing patient care without creating a harmful environment. The final deliverable of this project will be a highly accurate and advanced program readily adoptable by any health system or hospital to improve sepsis care and create a safer healthcare environment. 1 Project Narrative  Sepsis is a toxic response to a severe infection and represents a healthcare epidemic, which afflicts millions of people and accounts for 5% of all hospital costs and over $20 billion in the U.S. annually. This project's objective is to develop a cutting edge computer based tool, called Intelligent Sepsis Alert, with the power of machine intelligence (a form of artificial intelligence) and the ability to learn that will accurately identify sepsis patients for healthcare providers extremely early in their hospital course to ensure that patients receive all of the necessary life-saving interventions they need. Intelligent Sepsis Alert will be readily adoptable by other hospitals and health systems and by providing the critical real-time, bedside support for early sepsis identification will translate into multitudes of deaths prevented, abundant intensive care unit admissions avoided, hundreds of thousands of dollars saved and thousands of wasted nursing and physician man-hours eliminated.",Enhancing an EMR-Based Real-Time Sepsis Alert System Performance through Machine Learning,9280871,R21HS024750,[' '],AHRQ,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2017,149851,0.26637037466566515
"Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09) Abstract Background: Each year, poison control centers report approximately 75 bites by coral snakes (Micrurus and Micruroides species) in the United States. More than half of these occur in Florida, with the rest concentrated in the southeastern states, westward as far as Texas. Before the introduction of anti-coral antivenom by Wyeth in 1967, approximately 10% of Micrurus bites were potentially fatal, due to ventilatory failure caused by neurotoxins active at the neuromuscular junction. Wyeth Ayerst has recently ceased production of this antivenom. In October of 2009, the last vials will expire, leaving the U.S. without a licensed supplier of antivenom. Objectives: Licensure of a new antivenom product, Coralmyn. Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate the safety of Coralmyn in patients bitten by Micrurus coral snakes, by monitoring recipients for Type I and Type III immune reactions. (2) Demonstrate the value of plasma venom levels as a surrogate endpoint in coral snake bites by relating venom levels to severity of envenomation, before and after treatment. (3) Demonstrate that cost of treatment is different for patients presenting to hospitals with and without antivenom in stock, and use patient cost data to complete a pharmacoeconomic model comparing distribution methodologies applicable to Phase 3 or 4 study design. Research Design and Methods: This will be an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Coralmyn (anti-coral serum injectable solution, Instituto Bioclon, S.A. de C.V.) in male and female human patients of any age who present for emergency care following bites by coral snakes of genus Micrurus. Using grant funds, as many hospitals as economically feasible (at least 3 in Florida) will be provided with antivenom with which to enroll patients promptly in the study, using a central IRB. Patients presenting to other sites may enroll in the study either by interhospital transfer or by emergency delivery of antivenom to out-of-network hospitals. In all cases, clinical observations and plasma for venom levels will be collected at study enrollment and hourly until start of study drug. Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22. Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site. Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models. Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation. Project Narrative: Bites by coral snakes can be fatal if the bitten person does not receive antivenom promptly, but the only U.S. manufacturer of coral snake antivenom has stopped making it. This study will test the safety of a new antivenom in patients bitten by coral snakes, it will show whether testing for venom in the bloodstream is a useful way to determine how bad of a bite a person has, and it will show whether it is cost-effective to stock investigational antivenom in just a small number of places if there is no licensed antivenom for hospitals to buy.

"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9147610,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,190216,0.23468128602228486

"HYBRID ONTOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING BASED METHODS USING EMR DATA FOR EFFECTIVE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS); A SEPSIS CASE STUDY USING ICU DATA ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our research is focused on the use of advanced ontological models as a foundation for computerized Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems that link hospitalized patient data routinely captured in electronic medical records (EMRs) with medical knowledge to effectively influence timely awareness and treatment choices by clinicians. Our phase 1 goal is to demonstrate how our advanced CDS technology has the potential to improve preventable mortality outcomes associated with sepsis in ICU patients. We distinguish two types of CDS algorithms available today for detecting and/or predicting sepsis using EMR data: 1) evidence-based ""knowledge-driven"" detection algorithms; and 2) data-driven ""predictive"" algorithms based on machine learning (ML) techniques. Recent studies indicate currently available CDS tools do not reduce risk of death in hospitalized patients. We believe this may be because diseases such as sepsis are time-sensitive, complex syndromes and also due to the challenges of computerized reuse of unstructured EMR data. Our sepsis ontology models this complexity to: a) provide enhanced knowledge-driven sepsis risk- stratified cohort classifications that help guide interventions; b) support accurate natural language processing (NLP) of free text clinical notes to enhance real-time sepsis risk detection; and c) improve the accuracy of data- driven prediction models when used in conjunction with ML training algorithms. Our CDS is based on proprietary cluster computing technology we call ""VFusion"" designed to efficiently deal with the generation and practical use of large, application domain-specific ontologies. Our sepsis ontology employs a family of upper level ontologies, combined with granular evidence-based domain ontologies, configurable rule sets (e.g. first order logic-based), and required components of reference terminologies. Our research will use openly available ICU patient data to establish statistical detection/prediction performance metrics using this ontology in 2 modes of use: 1) as a knowledge-based screening tool to detect subtle signs of sepsis in individualized hospitalized patients; 2) used in conjunction with ML to improve data-driven predictive performance. We will measure specificity/sensitivity, and positive/negative predictive power of our hybrid ontology-based technology to demonstrate dramatically improved performance over existing CDS algorithms. In Phase II we plan a retrospective demonstration with a much larger sample of patients to include non-ICU patients in collaboration with a major healthcare system. Our product vision is an early inpatient sepsis detection algorithm with high accuracy embodied as a ""plug-in application"" compatible with any modern EMR platform in use at a client hospital effective in both ICU and non-ICU care settings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Even with the advent of powerful, new computer medical record technologies used in hospitals, the risk of death has not been reduced in hospitalized patients. The goal of this research effort is to combine medical record systems with advanced cognitive technologies that are commonly used today in products such as the iPhone ""Siri"" to improve clinician awareness and decisions that will dramatically reduce preventable mortality. Our initial use case will be the management of sepsis--=the leading cause of death in non-coronary intensive care units in hospitals                ",HYBRID ONTOLOGY AND MACHINE LEARNING BASED METHODS USING EMR DATA FOR EFFECTIVE CLINICAL DECISION SUPPORT (CDS); A SEPSIS CASE STUDY USING ICU DATA,9046860,R43LM012291,"['Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Awareness', 'Caring', 'Case Study', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Hybrids', 'Infection', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mortality Determinants', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Ontology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Plug-in', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Severities', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Vision', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effective therapy', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'mortality', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'tool']",NLM,"COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2015,149100,0.18959869762023915
"Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     Critical care medicine in the United States costs over 80 billion dollars annually. Over the past decade the rate of intensive care unit (ICU) use has been increasing, with a recent study reporting almost one in three Medicare beneficiaries experiencing an ICU visit during the last month of their lives. Every year, sepsis, a medical condition characterized by whole-body inflammation, strikes between 800,000 and 3.1 million Americans, killing approximately one in four patients affected. There is currently no definite treatment for sepsis in spite of many clinicl trials. However, early detection of sepsis and timely initiation of interventions are widely considered as important determinants of patient survival. However, basic care tasks (such as microbiological sampling and antibiotic delivery within 1 h, fluid resuscitation, and risk stratification using serum lactate or alternative), which are known to benefit most patients, are not performed in a timely manner. Previous literature suggests that high-resolution vital signs (such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), and other sequential measurements within the electronic medical records (EMRs), can be dynamically integrated using Machine Learning techniques to help with early detection of sepsis. With the ubiquity of inexpensive high- capacity storage and high-bandwidth streaming technology it is now possible to monitor patients' vital signs continuously (for instance, the research application developed by the Emory hospital ICU uses IBM's streaming analytics platform to transmit over 100,000 real-time data points per 100 beds, per second). Despite this continuous feed of data, commonly used acuity scores, such as APACHE and SAPS, are based on snapshot values of these vital signs (typically the worst values during a 24 hours period). This limitation is partially due to unavailability of computationally efficient and robust algorithms capable of finding predictive features in multivariate, nonlinear and nonstationary sequential data, which may reveal inter- organ communication and disintegration of causal couplings with critical illnesses such as sepsis.  We have recently developed a novel Machine Learning algorithm to discover automatically a collection of predictive multivariate dynamical patterns in a database of patient time-series, which can be used to classify patients or to monitor progression of disease in a given patient. The primary goal of this proposal is to apply our method to assess the predictive power of high- resolution multivariate time-series of vital signs and sequentially recorded EMR data in the ICU for early detection of sepsis and risk stratification of septic patient. To accomplish this, we aim to benchmark our technique on a large ICU cohort (the MIMIC II database with over 60,000 patients), as well as simulated data from a multiscale mathematical model of influence of inflammatory mediators on dynamical patterns of vital signs. Next, the technique will be externally validated on two separate ICU sepsis cohorts (the Emory Sepsis dataset and the Mayo Clinic Metric dataset). Finally, we will provide a real-time implementation of the proposed algorithm in an streaming environment (such as the IBM streaming analytics), in order to address the Big Data challenge of harnessing real-time, streaming sensor data from bedside monitors within the ICU, while enabling advanced pattern recognition and real-time forecasting. Ultimately we believe these methods can change the current standard of care through faster recognition and initiation of basic care, as well as guiding interventional strategis based on severity of illness and mechanisms underlying physiological deterioration.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). We want to develop methods to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for mortality and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the ICU.                ",Deep Learning and Streaming Analytics for Prediction of Adverse Events in the ICU,9044236,K01ES025445,"['Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Beds', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Trees', 'Deterioration', 'Differential Equation', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Employee Strikes', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Heart Rate', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicare', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'SCAP2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Severity of illness', 'Stratification', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telemedicine', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'beneficiary', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'feeding', 'improved', 'killings', 'mathematical model', 'mortality', 'multi-scale modeling', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'parallel computer', 'patient safety', 'portability', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory', 'safety practice', 'sensor', 'septic', 'simulation', 'standard of care', 'time use']",NIEHS,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,190216,0.23468128602228486
"Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Coralmyn for Coral Snake Bite (BB-IND 13926,01/02/09) Abstract Background: Each year, poison control centers report approximately 75 bites by coral snakes (Micrurus and Micruroides species) in the United States. More than half of these occur in Florida, with the rest concentrated in the southeastern states, westward as far as Texas. Before the introduction of anti-coral antivenom by Wyeth in 1967, approximately 10% of Micrurus bites were potentially fatal, due to ventilatory failure caused by neurotoxins active at the neuromuscular junction. Wyeth Ayerst has recently ceased production of this antivenom. In October of 2009, the last vials will expire, leaving the U.S. without a licensed supplier of antivenom. Objectives: Licensure of a new antivenom product, Coralmyn. Specific Aims: (1) Demonstrate the safety of Coralmyn in patients bitten by Micrurus coral snakes, by monitoring recipients for Type I and Type III immune reactions. (2) Demonstrate the value of plasma venom levels as a surrogate endpoint in coral snake bites by relating venom levels to severity of envenomation, before and after treatment. (3) Demonstrate that cost of treatment is different for patients presenting to hospitals with and without antivenom in stock, and use patient cost data to complete a pharmacoeconomic model comparing distribution methodologies applicable to Phase 3 or 4 study design. Research Design and Methods: This will be an open-label Phase 2 clinical trial of Coralmyn (anti-coral serum injectable solution, Instituto Bioclon, S.A. de C.V.) in male and female human patients of any age who present for emergency care following bites by coral snakes of genus Micrurus. Using grant funds, as many hospitals as economically feasible (at least 3 in Florida) will be provided with antivenom with which to enroll patients promptly in the study, using a central IRB. Patients presenting to other sites may enroll in the study either by interhospital transfer or by emergency delivery of antivenom to out-of-network hospitals. In all cases, clinical observations and plasma for venom levels will be collected at study enrollment and hourly until start of study drug. Following infusion of antivenom, clinical observations and plasma collection will be repeated at intervals until hospital discharge; and telephone follow-up will continue through day 22. Clinical and financial data will be extracted by examination of patient records including standardized data collection sheets completed prospectively by hospital staff and extracted into Case Report Forms secondarily by study staff at a central site. Plasma will be frozen and held for batch analysis every six months, using a Micrurus-specific ELISA assay. Statistical analysis of safety indicators will be conducted using Cox Proportional Hazard or survival models. Venom levels will be analyzed using a combination of logistic regression and ANOVA and compared with neurological assessments using a Generalized Linear Mixed Model. Cost data will be entered into a decision-tree model constructed in TreeAge HealthcarePro, and sensitivity analysis will be performed using MonteCarlo simulation. Project Narrative: Bites by coral snakes can be fatal if the bitten person does not receive antivenom promptly, but the only U.S. manufacturer of coral snake antivenom has stopped making it. This study will test the safety of a new antivenom in patients bitten by coral snakes, it will show whether testing for venom in the bloodstream is a useful way to determine how bad of a bite a person has, and it will show whether it is cost-effective to stock investigational antivenom in just a small number of places if there is no licensed antivenom for hospitals to buy.

"A web hospital comparison tool for patients considering kidney transplantation an    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses the need for objective hospital quality ranking tools that are relevant to patients' experiences and customizable to their individual conditions. This need is created by market changes where patients are increasingly being made aware of differences in quality between providers who will improve their odds at success. Medicare, state governments, insurers and several private companies offer information on hospital quality and cost across many conditions and incorporating a variety of data, process and outcomes quality indicators. However, according to investors, bankers, industry analysts and entrepreneurs, comparison tools are still at an embryonic stage.

"Using Big Data to Understand Sepsis in an Immunocompromised Population PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Through this proposal, I will develop and evaluate a sepsis prediction tool targeted to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Allogeneic HCT recipients are an immunocompromised population that is disproportionately affected by sepsis, a life-threatening dysregulated immunologic response to an infection. While it is well established that early detection and treatment of sepsis with fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics reduce the risk of mortality, recent data suggests early broad-spectrum antibiotic use in allogeneic HCT recipients may have microbiota-mediated detrimental effects on morbidity and mortality. Because of the risks associated with both missed and falsely identified sepsis events among allogeneic HCT recipients, early and accurate sepsis diagnosis is crucial. However, sepsis is generally challenging to diagnose and is made more complicated in allogeneic HCT recipients by the fact that sepsis presents differently following transplantation and common complications of the transplant procedure present like sepsis. In previous work, we demonstrated that current sepsis clinical criteria have low predictive value among allogeneic HCT recipients and concluded that population specific prediction tools are needed. Recently developed single algorithm, machine learning sepsis prediction tools have shown promising results in general, immuno-competent populations. However, few studies have tested the ability of machine learning workflows to predict sepsis in high-risk, immunocompromised patients, such as allogeneic HCT recipients. Additionally, current sepsis prediction tools rely on the assumption that the true relationship between the predictors and the outcome is contained within a single algorithm. This proposed work has two main objectives. The first is to develop an automated sepsis prediction tool for allogeneic HCT recipients using a state-of-the-art ensemble-based machine learning workflow (the super learner) that relaxes the single algorithm assumption of current sepsis prediction tools. The second is to estimate the utility of this tool in comparison to currently available tools in both traditional (accuracy methods) and novel ways (mathematical modeling of health outcomes). Both aims will be completed with the ultimate goal of improving sepsis prediction among allogeneic HCT recipients and in such, reducing sepsis related mortality and inappropriate antibiotic use among this hard to diagnose population. Further, this research will advance the methodological discussion around the usefulness of machine learning prediction tools in clinical practice and the use of ensemble modeling for prediction of rare, high-case fatality diseases. Such advances have the potential to improve the prediction of health outcomes beyond sepsis and reduce the burden of treatable diseases among immunocompromised populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening dysregulated host response to an infection that disproportionately affects allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Early detection and appropriate antibiotic therapy have been shown to reduce the risk of mortality in patients with sepsis, but clinical criteria currently recommended in sepsis detection have poor predictive value among HCT recipients. This project consists of the development of an automated, population-specific sepsis diagnostic tool and an estimate of the health implications of tool implementation.",Using Big Data to Understand Sepsis in an Immunocompromised Population,10064529,F31HL154509,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Allogenic', 'American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteremia', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompetent', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Speed', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Streptococcus', 'System', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'cancer care', 'clinical practice', 'data cleaning', 'hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'neural network', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'random forest', 'tool', 'treatment guidelines']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2020,45082,0.28407335362597386
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination  Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Enhanced Metadata Design, Architecture, and Learning (MeDAL) for Development of Generalizable Deep Learning-based Predictive Analytics from Electronic Health Records Sepsis, Septic Shock, and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) are among the top causes of hospital mortality, morbidity, and an increase in duration and cost of hospitalization. Successful prevention and management of these conditions rely on the ability of clinicians to estimate the risk, and ideally, to anticipate and prevent these events. Acute care settings and in particular intensive care units (ICUs) provide an environment where an immense amount of data is acquired, and it is expected that with the advent of wearables and biometric patches even more data will be available in such settings. But at present, very little of these data are used effectively to prognosticate, and the existing predictive analytics risk scores suffer from lack of generalizability across institutions and performance degradation within the same institution over time. The PIs on this proposal recently demonstrated that a Deep Learning-based algorithm can reliably predict new sepsis cases in the emergency departments, general hospital wards, and ICUs by as much as 4-6 hours in advance and an area under the curve (ROC) of 0.85-0.90. Furthermore, through a 2-year pilot study funded via Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), we recently joined forces in a multicenter academic consortium to retrospectively validate this algorithm at each site. Our collaboration has resulted in a multi-center longitudinal EHR dataset of critically ill patients and has generated several important questions and findings related to design of portable and generalizable predictive analytics algorithms that are robust to problems arising from gaps, errors, and biases in electronic health records (EHRs) due to workflow-related factors (e.g. staffing-level), and heterogeneity of patient populations and measurement devices. We propose to continue our prior work by designing new deep learning architectures that are more robust to data missingness and biases introduced through the variability in process of care, 2) development of new learning methodologies to improve generalizability of the proposed models under data/population drifts (aka distributional changes), 3) enhanced metadata design to assist in quantifying âconditions for useâ of such algorithms via algorithmic controls, and 4) HL7 and FHIR-based prospective implementation and testing of these methodologies to provide real-world evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Ultimately, these novel methodologies and tools will enhance our ability to use EHR and other types of continuously measured longitudinal data to predict adverse events, assess patientsâ response to therapy, and optimize and personalize care at the beside. The proposed project is making use of computers to analyze data from sickest patients in hospitals. We want to develop methods that work across different demographics groups and hospital settings to identify patterns in the patient data which predict who is at risk for life- threatening conditions such as Sepsis and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), and who might respond to various medications which could make them better. We have a very strong team of doctors and researchers who work closely together, covering all aspects of the proposed research, which we hope will help us improve the lives of the sickest patients in the hospitals.","Enhanced Metadata Design, Architecture, and Learning (MeDAL) for Development of Generalizable Deep Learning-based Predictive Analytics from Electronic Health Records",10265157,R56LM013517,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Architecture', 'Area Under Curve', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biometry', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Provenance', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Expenditure', 'Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Site', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'Work', 'acute care', 'aging population', 'authority', 'base', 'cloud based', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient response', 'personalized care', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'research and development', 'response', 'septic patients', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'ward']",NLM,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R56,2020,393958,0.08322789424585104
"Characterizing patients at risk for sepsis through Big Data Characterizing Patients at Risk for Sepsis Through Big Data SUMMARY The goal of this KL2 research proposal is create an extension of an existing data-driven sepsis algorithm, the artificial intelligence sepsis expert (AISE), by forecasting the type and sequence of sepsis-specific organ failure using clinical data from the electronic medical record, then identifying the incremental benefit received by adding high-resolution data derived from cardiovascular waveforms (arterial waveform and electrocardiographic waves), and small molecule metabolite data over time to provide some mechanistic context. The most important data (features) used in real-time from AISE will be used as inputs for a fuzzy k- means clustering algorithm (âSaving Organs from Sepsisâ, or SOS) using retrospectively-collected data, designed to better characterize patients at risk for sepsis by their organ failure. I have selected three organs in particular: shock, acute respiratory failure, and acute kidney injury (AKI). Principal component analyses (PCA) data from 2,375 ICU patients with sepsis will be projected onto a novel visual representation for patient phenotyping based on risk of (trajectory toward) different types of organ failure. I will identify if this SOS algorithm can accurately forecast new organ failure within 12 hours based on SOS. To better understand the impact of specific features on organ failure, I will test the ability of each high- resolution features, and metabolomics data to forecast septic shock. Among those who develop septic shock, I will measure all nine high-resolution features from the beginning of the ICU stay up to shock onset and compare those changes to those who develop sepsis but not septic shock, and those who do not develop sepsis. I will then see if the collective addition of high-resolution data improves performance of septic shock forecasting. Finally, I will conduct a prospective observational study to collect metabolomic information in a 60- patient study to identify the incremental improvement of adding metabolomics data to SOS for predicting septic shock, over SOS with just EMR and waveform data. The results of this work will provide preliminary data for further career development and NIH-funding. The long-term goal would be to build a model that optimizes the timing of appropriate therapy, thus decreasing the incidence of sepsis and associated organ failure. As a K23 candidate, I will use this award to acquire formal didactic training and more hands-on experience in machine learning, signal processing, metabolomics analysis. I will seek focused training that will complement my experience as a clinical trialist so that I can design high-quality studies to contribute to Big Data analytics in critical care research and practice. My overarching career goal is to become a leader in the application of Big Data analysis of critically ill patients to predict progression of disease, specifically sepsis. The Emory environment is an ideal place to develop these capabilities. Emory Healthcare houses over 200 medical, surgical, and subspecialty ICU beds, many of which are âwiredâ to store streaming data. In addition to the physical resources, my development will be enhanced by my superb mentorship team, led by Dr. Greg Martin. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis, the bodyâs response to a life-threatening infection that causes damage to itself, is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and around the world, and failure of vital organs is one of the biggest contributors. This project is designed to predict organ failure specific to sepsis using cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology using readily-available information, and experimental blood tests.

"A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning Project Summary  Sepsis is a serious condition induced by an infection, often by a bacterial pathogen, leading to organ damage or even death. Despite numerous advances in medicine over the years, the condition still affects millions of people in both developed and developing countries. In the US, sepsis affects 1.7M and kills over 265,000 people annually. Sepsis mortality rates in developing countries are substantially higher. In terms of demographics, sepsis affects humans of all age and race, but it is most pronounced at the age extremes (infants and the elderly) and patients whose immune system is already under strain due to other illnesses or immune system-weakening therapies, e.g., cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.  Blood cultures are currently the default technique used in detecting and diagnosing the root cause of sepsis. However, blood-cultures can take upwards of 24-48 hours in order to obtain results. In that time, the patient can experience irreversible harm due to the condition if not treated properly. Unfortunately, precise and effective antibiotic treatment requires knowledge of the pathogen causing sepsis. Beyond a long time to get an answer, blood cultures often exhibit alarmingly high false negatives (failure to detect a pathogen causing sepsis) and typically do not precisely identify the pathogen causing sepsis.  Hence there have been several efforts aimed at detecting and identifying the broad range of potential pathogens causing sepsis and circumventing the need for blood cultures. However, many of the recently proposed methods for detecting and diagnosing sepsis exhibit one or more of the following drawbacks: (i) they lack high sensitivity (ability to detect a pathogen); (ii) they cannot accurately identify a broad range of pathogens from a single sam- ple; (iii) take a (relatively) long time; (iv) require a large volume of blood; or (v) cannot be used in the real-time monitoring of sepsis (either detecting pathogens known to cause sepsis or quantifying the patient's response to antimicrobial treatment).  We are proposing a new sepsis detection method, combining ï¬ow imaging microscopy (a high-throughput technique for imaging millions of microscopic particles) and deep learning based image analysis (techniques leveraged in facial recognition and self-driving cars) to overcome the above mentioned limitations. The approach has proven capable of detecting a variety of bacterial species in low concentrations of mouse blood in less than 1 hour of processing time with as little as 50 L of blood. In this proposal, one of our aims is to optimize our approach and quantify the accuracy and limits of detection in human blood. Our patent pending approach has also been licensed to a major manufacturer of ï¬ow imaging microscopes. Another aim of this research is to begin integration of our technology with an existing commercial instrument with the intention of providing a compact self- contained device that can be deployed at numerous hospitals world-wide. The implementation of our platform should have a major impact on antimicrobial treatment in all areas of the hospital. Project Narrative  Sepsis affects 1.7M US citizens (causing roughly 270k deaths) each year; the condition is also the most expensive condition treated in US hospitals costing approximately 24B USD each year. Current methods for detecting and determining the source of the infection causing sepsis are inaccurate, too slow, and do not provide detailed pathogen speciï¬c information needed for effective treatment. Our proposal aims at developing a fast approach, combining ï¬ow imaging microscopy and deep learning, for detecting and determining the root cause of sepsis from blood samples (addressing many issues facing sepsis detection and diagnosis) which can deployed at a variety of hospitals worldwide.",A New Tool to Rapidly Diagnose Sepsis using Flow Imaging Microscopy and Machine Learning,10078833,R43EB029863,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bacteria', 'Bedside Testings', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Volume', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification Scheme', 'Colony-forming units', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Systems', 'Culture Techniques', 'DNA', 'Detection', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infection', 'Intention', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Length of Stay', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microfluidic Microchips', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Newborn Infant', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Organism', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Premature Birth', 'Preparation', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'age group', 'antimicrobial', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'clinically relevant', 'data exchange', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'detector', 'digital imaging', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'human DNA', 'human old age (65+)', 'image processing', 'improved', 'infant death', 'instrument', 'intrapartum', 'microscopic imaging', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'nano', 'nanoproducts', 'neonatal sepsis', 'older patient', 'optic flow', 'particle', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient response', 'point of care', 'preterm newborn', 'processing speed', 'prototype', 'rapid diagnosis', 'real time monitoring', 'side effect', 'tool']",NIBIB,"URSA ANALYTICS, INC.",R43,2020,112402,0.23195344213665753
"Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Summary: Sepsis is a poorly understood clinical syndrome characterized by a dysregulation of the immune systemâs response to infection. It is the leading cause of death and is the most expensive condition treated in U.S. hospitals, exerting a $20.3 billion burden in 2011, 5.2% of total costs to the healthcare system nationwide. One of the major challenges facing clinicians is to identify and recognize patients with sepsis and impending organ dysfunction. The clinical manifestations of sepsis are highly variable and the signs of infection and organ dysfunction can be subtle and may mimic other conditions. Sepsis is also highly time critical. Every 1-hour delay in antibiotics after emergency department (ED) triage or the onset of organ dysfunction or shock is associated with a 3â7% increase in the odds of a poor outcome. These conditions have created an environment where physicians have to diagnose a complex, heterogeneous condition in a short timeframe with limited information. There is currently a dire need for a tool that can quickly assess if a patient is at risk for sepsis. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the worldâs largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments. This dataset & biobank currently have >2,000 patients, >70,000 proprietary biomarker measurements, >1,200,000 Electronic Medical Record (EMR) parameters, and >25,000 samples banked (all with accompanying full time series EMR data). We currently have executed contracts for 6 total hospital partnerships, with the potential to expand the dataset by >65,000 patients per year if our pipeline were at full capacity. In this proposed project, Prenosis will finalize the first version of the NOSISTM platform by growing our current proprietary dataset & biobank from its current size of about 2,000 patients to over 10,000 total patients (Aim 1). Using the current 2,000 patient dataset, we have demonstrated initial promising endotypes of sepsis that could be useful for a variety of critical clinical problems. As we grow the dataset to 10,000 patients, we will use unsupervised machine learning algorithms trained on roughly half of the patients (5,000) to definitively prove the robustness and usefulness of these endotypes. The other half of the patients (other 5,000) will be used as a multi-site validation cohort for the endotypes determined by the ML algorithms (Aim 2). We will also finalize the actual software platform for the NOSISTM product (Aim 3), including data security, restricted access by collaborators to train and jointly develop products, and templates for business partnerships with potential collaborators (with an initial focus on HIT companies and pharma companies). Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, first, middle): Reddy, Jr., Bobby Project Narrative: At least 30 percent of antibiotics prescribed in the United States are unnecessary. This has obviously catastrophic implications for the future of humanity. Sepsis is the third leading cause of death in the United States with an annual toll of over 230,000 people. Survival rates have been reported to drop by 7.6% per hour appropriate treatment is delayed. This drastic drop in survival rate leads to vast over prescription of antibiotics in hospital settings. Prenosis is a company focused on elucidating the complexity of dysregulated host response to infection. In partnership with 4 hospitals, we have built the worldâs largest and most rapidly growing dataset & data-rich biobank that combine time series biomarker data with clinical data for patients suspected of infection in hospital environments.

In this project, we are proposing work to finalize our NOSISTM product. NOSISTM is a software platform that allows collaborators (hospital IT departments, researchers, health information technology (HIT) companies, drug companies, and government agencies) to utilize the constantly growing proprietary Prenosis dataset & accompanying data-rich biobank. Using NOSISTM, collaborators can develop new sepsis screening technologies and clinical decision support tools, dramatically increase success of clinical drug trials, and revolutionize our scientific understanding of the endotypes of dysregulation of host response.",Collaborative Platform for Developing Sepsis Products by Leveraging Sepsis Endotypes Developed Using a Unified Biomarker-Clinical Dataset,10082229,R44GM139529,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Award', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood specimen', 'Businesses', 'Cause of Death', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Security', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Fees', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Infection', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteins', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Security', 'Security Measures', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Survival Rate', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triage', 'United States', 'University Hospitals', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'data de-identification', 'data hosting', 'encryption', 'health information technology', 'machine learning algorithm', 'payment', 'prevent', 'programs', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'specific biomarkers', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,"PRENOSIS, INC.",R44,2020,989523,0.17175002011812418
"Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Annually, more than 200,000 patients die in U.S. hospitals from cardiac arrest1 and over 130,000 patients inpatients deaths are attributed to sepsis.2 These deaths are preventable if patients who are at risk are detected earlier. Our prior work found that nursing documentation within electronic health records (EHRs) contains information that could contribute to early detection and treatment, but these data are not being analyzed and exposed by EHRs to clinicians to initiate interventions quickly enough to save patients.3â6 We defined a new source of predictive data by analyzing the frequency and types of nursing documentation that indicated nurses' increased surveillance and level of concern for a patient. These data documented in the 48 hours preceding a cardiac arrest and hospital mortality were predictive of the event.3 While clinicians strive to provide the best care, there is a systematic problem within hospital settings of non-optimal communication between nurses and doctors leading to delays in care for patient at risk.6â8,9 Well-designed and tested EHRs are able to trend data and support communication and decision making, but too often fall short of these goals and actually increase clinician cognitive load through fragmented information displays, ânote bloatâ, and information overload.10 Substitutable Medical Applications & Reusable Technologies (SMARTapps) using Fast Health Interoperability Resource (FHIR) standard allow for open sharing and use of innovations across EHR systems. The aim of this project is to design and evaluate a SMARTapp on FHIR used across two large academic medical centers that exposes to physicians and nurses our new predictive data source from nursing documentation to increase care team situational awareness of at risk patients to decrease preventable adverse outcomes. The SMARTapp we will design and evaluate is the Communicating Narrative Concerns Entered by RNs (CONCERN) Clinical Decision Support (CDS) system. This will be integrated at four hospitals part of two health systems, Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Newton Wellesley Hospital (NWH), part of Partners Healthcare System (PHS) in Boston, and NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital-Columbia University Medical Center (NYP-CUMC) and The Allen Hospital, part of New York Presbyterian Health System (NYP) in New York. Specifically, we will: 1) validate desired thresholds for the CONCERN SMARTapp, 2) integrate the CONCERN SMARTapp for early warning of risky patient states within CDS tools, 3) evaluate the CONCERN SMARTapp on primary outcomes of in-hospital mortality and length of stay and secondary outcomes of cardiac arrest, unanticipated transfers to the intensive care unit, and 30-day hospital readmission rates. The methods we will use include: data-mining and natural language processing, factorial design surveys, simulation testing for evaluating team-based situational awareness, and outcomes evaluation in the Medical Intensive Care Units and Acute Care Units (non-ICU) at our study sites. Project narrative There are patients who die or have a bad outcome in the hospital and this could be prevented. Data in the nurses' notes could be used by computers and Apps to tell the care team that a patient is not doing well and that they should act more quickly. This project will build an App that makes it easier for the care team to see and understand that data and act quickly to save patients.",Communicating narrative Concerns entered by RNs (CONCERN),9869048,R01NR016941,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Big Data Methods', 'Boston', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Death', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chiroptera', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Communication', 'Computers', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Mail', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Inpatients', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Length of Stay', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Notification', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Process', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sepsis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Woman', 'Work', 'acute care', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive load', 'computerized', 'data mining', 'design', 'experience', 'falls', 'information display', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'meetings', 'member', 'mortality', 'patient safety', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'prevent', 'preventable death', 'primary outcome', 'readmission rates', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'software systems', 'support tools', 'tool', 'trend', 'user-friendly']",NINR,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,595773,0.0540086376251248
"A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Advances in acute care have decreased short-term mortality of sepsis, resulting in an increasing number of survivors who experience significant morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infections account for 60% of hospital readmissions after sepsis and are an important cause of long-term mortality. Identifying sepsis survivors at risk for infections and understanding predisposing factors are therefore important first steps to develop personalized interventions to improve long-term outcomes. The overall research goal is to develop innovative targeted interventions to improve long-term outcomes after sepsis. This proposal focuses on identifying subgroups of sepsis survivors (phenotypes) at high risk for infection-related hospital readmissions and deaths. It is hypothesized that the combination of host factors, disease characteristics, and interventions prior to and during sepsis will identify distinct phenotypes that are captured by clinical data. These clinical phenotypes likely have distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms (e.g., immunosuppression), predispose to different outcomes (e.g., recurrent infections), and patients with the same phenotype may respond similarly to targeted interventions such as immunomodulation. In Aim 1, three nationally representative datasets of sepsis survivors will be assembled and analyzed by machine learning techniques to identify valid clinical sepsis phenotypes. In Aim 2, phenotypes at high-risk for infection-related readmissions and deaths at 6 months will be identified, and underlying biomarker profiles for these phenotypes analyzed. In Aim 3, these high-risk phenotypes will be used to conceptualize and simulate an adaptive platform trial designed to test the efficacy of three different immunomodulatory drugs. An adaptive trial design was chosen, because it can test multiple interventions simultaneously and reduces the chances of exposing patients to ineffective or harmful interventions. The research plan is augmented by expert mentoring and rigorous didactic training. Together, this will provide the candidate with essential career development skills in the science of precision medicine, including machine learning methodologies, Bayesian statistics, and innovate clinical trial design. This proposal has potentially groundbreaking implications for the future treatment of sepsis survivors, because it deviates from the current âone-size fits allâ approach and attempts to create the framework for personalized interventions. This framework sets the stage for future independent investigator (RO1) applications evaluating personalized treatments in adaptive clinical trials, and will uniquely position the candidate as a future leader in the field of long-term outcomes after critical illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is important for public health because sepsis is a life-threatening infection that affects 30 million people worldwide each year. Long-term outcomes for patients who survive a hospital admission for sepsis are poor, and many patients develop new disabilities or worsening of preexisting health conditions. This proposal supports the NIHâs mission to enhance health and reduce illness and disability by trying to identify interventions for sepsis survivors at highest risk for poor outcomes.",A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors,9897562,K23GM132688,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Interleukin-7', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Sepsis', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'acute care', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'recurrent infection', 'response', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'trial design']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2020,187984,0.26096157345093796
"Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia As an ICU physician and an immunologist, I have devoted my research career to understanding sepsis,  a disease that affects nearly 2 million people annually in the USA. Sepsis is a life-threatening  condition that arises when the body's response to infection injures its own tissues. Great strides  have been made towards improving the clinical care of the septic patient, but the mortality rate  remains >20% for several reasons: First, each sepsis-causing pathogen, be it bacterial, viral, or  fungal, carries its own virulence factors that affect the host response, but unfortunately, much  research has focused on studying septic patients as a group, rather than distinguishing patients  based on microbiologic cause. Second, researchers often study patients once they manifest  sepsis-induced organ failure yet many people sustain infections due to common sepsis  pathogens, like Staphylococcus aureus, but never develop sepsis; understanding the ""appropriate""  response to a pathogen is critical to understanding the ""inappropriate"" response of  sepsis. Finally, much sepsis research occurs in silos; clinician researchers focus on the  electronic medical record, while basic scientists analyze biologic data. Too often, these  groups do not collaborate to share information, even though understanding the biologic  significance of clinical data may be of great value. To address these issues, I propose a unique  approach to understand the host response to infection that incorporates both biologic data and  clinical electronic medical record (EMR) data from patients with S. aureus bacteremia.  By limiting analysis of the host response to infections caused by a single pathogen at a single  site, we can control for the variability induced by pathogen-specific factors. In addition,  by studying all patients with S. aureus bacteremia, and not simply those patients with  sepsis, we can understand both the appropriate host response as well as the inappropriate host  response that characterizes the development of sepsis. With our bank of samples collected from S.  aureus bacteremia patients we will analyze both cellular mRNA transcripts and plasma  protein/cytokine levels, collected at different time points from each patient. We will  combine the results of these analyses with clinical data found in the EMR to provide a correlation  between the biology of the host response and its clinical manifestations. Our per-patient  data, then, will have unprecedented granularity which we can then use to apply machine learning  techniques to identify multi-faceted endotypes that predict outcomes (such as mortality). Once we  have built these endotype models, we will validate them using pilot data collected from newly  enrolled patients with either S. aureus or E. coli bacteremia. This approach will allow  us to identify factors common to the dysregulated host response across all infections, as well as  those that may be specific to the type of infection. Understanding both the  appropriate and the inappropriate host response to infection, and understanding which  aspects of the host response are pathogen-specific (and which are not) will allow development  of novel therapies for this devastating disease. The mortality rate due to severe sepsis exceeds 20%, yet in spite of 3 decades of research, we  still have a very limited understanding of the dysregulated host response that drives  this mortality. I will use my experience as a PhD-trained immunologist and ICU physician to  study the host response to the two most common causes of bacteremia in hospitalized patients, S.  aureus and E. coli. Understanding both appropriate and dysregulated host responses to infections as  manifested in both biological and clinical data will allow me to develop precision therapy to treat  this deadly disease.","Merging Temporal Changes in Clinical Informatics, Transcriptomics, and Cytokine Profiles to Understand the Host Response to Bacteremia",10022505,R03HL148295,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Allergic', 'Award', 'Bacteremia', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Consent', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Hour', 'Immune', 'Immune Targeting', 'Immune response', 'Immunologist', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Proteins', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Proteins', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Site', 'Staphylococcus aureus', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virulence Factors', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'personalized therapeutic', 'prospective', 'response', 'septic', 'septic patients', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2020,79000,0.14155679122304135
"Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance PROJECT ABSTRACT Sepsis is a devastating syndrome that represents a leading cause of death, morbidity, and healthcare costs. Its impact is amplified by rising rates of antimicrobial resistance. Improving sepsis outcomes primarily results from prescribing timely antibiotics based on the estimated risk of multidrug resistance (MDR). Previous models grossly overestimated the MDR risk and exacerbated the escalating rates of antimicrobial resistance and excess mortality. The overall goal of this proposed K08 research is to identify common sepsis phenotypes that will enable better prescribing practices and standardized comparisons across hospitals, which will help practicing clinicians, researchers, healthcare institutions, and policy makers. These themes correlate with NIGMS's interest in finding innovative methods and leveraging big data to improve sepsis outcomes. Our three specific aims reflect these goals: (1) establish resistance thresholds for MDR Gram- negative bacilli (GNB) that cause sepsis, (2) assess the impact of sepsis definition on the performance of risk prediction models for MDR GNB, and (3) identify sepsis phenotypes at high risk for MDR GNB in a well-balanced cohort and assess the impact of case mix on risk prediction model performance. We will mathematically derive resistance thresholds that link population resistance rates to individual patient risk of death in sepsis caused by MDR GNB, assess factors that impact prediction performance, and incorporate rich clinical data from 15 hospitals in our healthcare system to identify stable common sepsis phenotypes. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has training in Infectious Diseases and Critical Care Medicine and experience in antimicrobial resistance in critically ill patients. This proposal will build on her clinical work and previous research experience in finding innovative methods to solve challenging problems at the intersection of infectious diseases and critical care medicine. Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has six career objectives: (1) pursue advanced training in clinical epidemiology; (2) acquire skills in advanced linear regression and multilevel modeling; (3) learn supervised machine learning methods; (4) acquire skills in big data management in healthcare and methods to handle missing data; (5) improve scientific communication, grantsmanship, and leadership, and (6) participate in training in the responsible conduct of research. She will achieve these goals through didactic coursework, hands-on research experience, and active mentoring from experts in Infectious Diseases, Critical Care Medicine, and applied clinical informatics. She will continue to develop innovative methods to mitigate the antimicrobial resistance crisis, especially in critically ill patients, and become an analytics translator at the intersection of clinical medicine and clinical applied informatics. The fertile research environment at Washington University in St. Louis, the experienced mentorship team, and a well-crafted career development plan will enable Dr. Vazquez Guillamet to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independently funded clinician-investigator utilizing big data to develop applications for risk prediction, surveillance, and outcome comparisons in antimicrobial resistance and sepsis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The significant burden of sepsis augmented by the escalating rates of antimicrobial resistance has incited many national performance improvement initiatives. Research efforts have focused on predicting patients at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant pathogens but existing models have led to risk overestimation thus promoting indiscriminate antimicrobial use and further fueling the emergence of resistance. The candidate, Dr. Vazquez Guillamet has focused on innovative ways to assess the impact of antimicrobial resistance and to develop generalizable useful risk prediction models. The current proposed research expands her previous work with the overall goal to develop clinical decision support tools that will improve antibiotic prescribing practices and will allow valid, case-mix adjusted comparisons across hospitals in terms of resistance prevalence rates and antimicrobial use.",Sepsis phenotypes at risk for infections caused by multidrug resistant Gram-negative bacilli: elucidating the impact of sepsis definition and patient case mix on prediction performance,10106044,K08GM140310,"['American', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Bacillus', 'Big Data', 'Case Mixes', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Empiricism', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Excess Mortality', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Infection', 'Informatics', 'Institution', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multi-Drug Resistance', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Surveys', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'attributable mortality', 'base', 'big data management', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical epidemiology', 'cohort', 'combat', 'experience', 'hands on research', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'personalized risk prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'primary outcome', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'risk prediction model', 'septic patients', 'skills', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'tool', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,167942,0.17453425824484464
"Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence Abstract Development of augmented intelligence (AI) models for predicting clinical outcomes is growing exponentially. Automated clinical surveillance to assist in early detection of in-hospital deterioration such as sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) is a promising AI application. As many as 300,000 US hospital patients die each year from problems like sepsis and AKI and 5% or more of these deaths are preventable. Many more patients suffer harm or additional costs as a sequelae to delayed response. Compared to traditional rule-based risk predictions, advanced AI models using methods such as machine learning demonstrate improved reliability of predicting sepsis and AKI. The effectiveness of these systems in practice will likely depend on how AI risk information is integrated into clinical workflow and technologies, yet we are not aware of research to design or evaluate effective in-hospital AI risk information presentation and user interaction. It is widely known that explainable AI is desirable, but what needs to be explained and how to do it effectively and efficiently is not known. There is a need to understand end user perspectives on the value of AI for specific clinical contexts. We will draw on our team's recent research on effective clinical display design, theoretical models of human-AI performance, application of human-AI design principles, and application of human-centered design methods to design and evaluate effective approaches to support timely response to sepsis and AKI risk. Our primary objectives are to: identify factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of AI usefulness, generate design principles for effective health risk surveillance human-AI interaction, and design human-AI user interfaces that meaningfully improve human-AI performance when responding to sepsis and AKI. In Aim 1, we will develop a temporal reasoning AI model for predicting in-hospital development of sepsis and AKI. We will apply this model to retrospective patient data to serve as context for research activities. Using chart review, we will quantify realistic metrics of human-AI system performance that take into account whether the AI model would have predicted deterioration before the clinical team suspected or acted in response to the event. In Aim 2, we will interview clinicians while reviewing temporal progression of a patient's change in condition over their stay, including AI generated risk information. We will gather qualitative data on factors that influence clinicians' perceptions of usefulness of AI information toward the goal of early identification of patient problems. In Aim 3, we will conduct participatory design activities with clinicians to design effective human-centered AI display and interaction to support early response to in-hospital sepsis and AKI. Finally, in Aim 4, using simulated realistic patient care tasks and comparing to traditional patient information technologies, we will evaluate the impact of human-centered AI designs on human-AI performance. We will generate human-AI interaction design guidance for health risk surveillance. Our findings are expected to innovate design for human-AI interaction in electronic health records (EHRs) and health-care monitoring and communication technologies. Narrative As many as 15,000 preventable deaths and many more preventable invasive procedures occur each year in US hospitals due to late detection of unexpected deterioration and emergencies such as cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest, sepsis, and bleeding. Advanced approaches to augmented intelligence (AI) through methods such as machine learning may help clinicians to identify and respond to problems early, but little is known about how to effectively present risk information and support interaction between AI and clinicians. The goals of this project are to: identify factors that impact the usefulness of AI, design human-centered AI approaches to reduce harm from late response to sepsis and acute kidney injury, and generate design principles to ensure that AI solutions can be used effectively by clinicians to improve patient care.",Timely Response to In-Hospital Deterioration Through Design of Actionable Augmented Intelligence,9946956,R01GM137083,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adverse event', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Expert Systems', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Information Technology', 'Interview', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Reaction Time', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Risk', 'Saints', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Source', 'System', 'Technology', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'augmented intelligence', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'prototype', 'respiratory', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'simulation', 'skills']",NIGMS,IDAHO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,439224,0.11670550413494757
"PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model Project Summary/Abstract Each year over 75,000 children develop sepsis in the United States resulting in substantial morbidity, up to 20% mortality, and billions in US health care expenditures. There have been substantial advances that demonstrate improved patient outcomes with adherence to early aggressive emergency care. However, methods to accurately, reliably, and rapidly identify children who require these resource-intensive therapies are lacking. In addition, understanding the impact of these therapies on near-term outcomes, before significant morbidity occurs, is also lacking. Current algorithms do not reliably discriminate between patients who develop sepsis and those who are clinically similar upon initial presentation but do not progress to sepsis. As a result, children requiring life-saving treatments do not receive them, or do not receive them in a timely fashion, and others may be over-treated, wasting healthcare resources and potentially diverting emergency care from those in need. With the advent of electronic health records (EHR), there are now information-enabled solutions that offer unique opportunities to identify non-biased, heterogeneous samples of children and allow us to accurately and reliably measure risk factors and near-term outcomes for sepsis. This work addresses the critical need to improve pediatric sepsis outcomes by developing methods to accurately identify at-risk children presenting for emergency care. Utilizing the infrastructure of the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN), this proposal will innovatively capture EHR data to create a multi-center registry with the ultimate goal to improve the detection and treatment of pediatric sepsis in the ED setting. To accomplish this, we propose the following specific aims: We will develop an expanded multicenter sepsis registry for pediatric patients from merged electronic health record clinical data from different hospitals with different EHR data sources. We will automate the determination of organ dysfunction in children with sepsis directly from structured and narrative data within the multicenter EHR registry. From the registry and outcome data, we will derive and validate a prediction model of pediatric sepsis using emergency department EHR data from the first 4 hours of care that predicts subsequent organ dysfunction within 48 hours. Each of these aims works to the goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, an automated process of outcome determination, and a prediction model of risk of sepsis. We will also have a strong foundation for future projects to implement and evaluate decision support tools, improve diagnostic techniques, engage in comparative effectiveness studies, measure quality of care, establish linked bio-repositories, and guide clinical trial design.Â The proposed project, thus, has enormous potential to improve our ability to improve the quality of care provided to our most acutely ill children.Â  Project Narrative Sepsis is a leading cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality with life-saving treatment dependent on early and accurate identification. We will establish a multi-center data registry from electronic health records (EHR), identify a multi-center cohort of pediatric patients at risk for sepsis, automate sepsis-related pediatric organ dysfunction directly from the registry EHR data, and develop an emergency department based prediction model of sepsis related organ dysfunction. Each of these aims has the ultimate goal of improving the emergent care for pediatric sepsis with innovative deliverables from this project including the existence of a broad and rich EHR registry, the automated process of important proximal outcome determination, and an emergency department prediction model of risk of sepsis.Â ","PED Screen: Pediatric Sepsis EHR Registry, Clinical Outcomes, and Predictive Model",9864083,R01HD087363,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Achievement', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Applied Research', 'Blood Pressure', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergent care', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infrastructure', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cohort', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Quality of Care', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'data registry', 'design', 'effective intervention', 'electronic registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient health information', 'patient registry', 'pediatric emergency', 'pediatric patients', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'septic patients', 'support tools', 'wasting']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,611937,0.22492729893790253
"Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis 7. ABSTRACT / PROJECT SUMMARY We propose the âAutomated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsisâ study to develop automated technologies capable of accurate atrial fibrillation (AF) detection and prediction during sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated response to infection and the most common illness leading to hospitalization in the United States, affecting ~1 million Americans yearly, and is associated with 50% of all hospital deaths. With the exception early antibiotic and fluid use, few therapies improve outcomes among septic patients; new treatment strategies are greatly needed to improve survival. New-onset AF is a common dysrhythmia among critically ill patients with sepsis, affecting up to 1 in 3 septic patients and conferring increased short- and long-term risks stroke, heart failure, and death. Prevention of AF or its complications may improve sepsis outcomes by reducing AF-related morbidity and mortality. Although several evidence-based treatments have shown efficacy in treating and preventing AF in certain high-risk subgroups (e.g., AF prevention following cardiac surgery), studying application of these therapies among critically ill patients with sepsis has been hampered by two major factors: 1) we lack validated automated mechanisms to detect AF and facilitate real-world AF research in large clinical databases, and 2) we cannot presently predict which patients with sepsis will develop AF. Our project will leverage the unique resources of the recently released Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC III) database. MIMIC III links continuous ECG and pulse plethysmographic waveforms to a wealth of time-varying clinical and hemodynamic data. Our project will develop and validate state-of-the art automated AF detection algorithms using waveform data from critically ill patients. Automated AF detection would enable expedited clinical treatment of AF, identification of subclinical AF, and will catalyze the study of AF in emerging electronic health record waveform databases. We will develop innovative automated AF prediction capabilities using state-of-the-art waveform analysis algorithms and machine learning methods in critically ill patients. Automated algorithms that identify patients at high risk for developing AF in the near-term would enable targeting of preventative therapies and potentially usher in a new era of AF prevention for critically ill patients. AF prevention and treatment facilitated through our project will allow targeting of novel, AF-based mechanisms of poor outcomes during and following sepsis. 8. Project Narrative Sepsis is a dysregulated response to infection that causes life-threatening organ dysfunction that affects nearly 1 million Americans each year. Atrial fibrillation is a form of cardiac dysfunction that occurs during sepsis characterized by abnormal heart rhythm, loss of normal atrial contraction, rapid heart rates, heart failure, shock and increased risk for stroke. Our proposal seeks to develop automated methods for the detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis, methods that will enhance our future ability to prevent and treat atrial fibrillation to avoid its life-threatening consequences.",Automated detection and prediction of atrial fibrillation during sepsis,9910440,R01HL136660,"['Affect', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antibiotics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Big Data', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Electrolytes', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Infection', 'Intelligence', 'Intensive Care', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Liquid substance', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prevention', 'Preventive therapy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Stroke', 'Stroke Volume', 'Subgroup', 'Technology', 'Telemetry', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical predictors', 'comorbidity', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'heart rhythm', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'prevent', 'response', 'septic patients', 'stroke risk', 'therapeutic target', 'time use', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,535600,0.23847842030077754
"Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in over 50% of patients with sepsis and is associated with increased risk of mortality and other complications, including longer hospital length of stay and the development or progression of chronic kidney disease. To date, therapies for sepsis associated AKI (SA-AKI) remain largely supportive. One possible reason for the failure of targeted therapies may be the currently limited understanding of the pathophysiology of the condition. Traditionally, SA-AKI has been thought to be largely due to renal ischemia secondary to hypoperfusion. However, animal models show that SA-AKI is actually a state characterized by hyperdynamic circulation, and review of histological changes in septic patients shows a lack of acute tubular necrosis, a pathological finding often associated with renal ischemia. Rather, it appears that a combination of immunologic, toxic and inflammatory factors likely leads to SA-AKI, and intervening along these pathways may improve patient outcomes for SA-AKI. We hypothesize that within a population with SA-AKI, there are subgroups who have particular inflammatory and immunological profiles that are associated with differential outcomes and response to therapies. In the fields of asthma and the acute respiratory distress syndrome, the use of clinical data and biomarkers to identify such subpopulations, or sub-phenotypes, of disease, has led to new treatment paradigms, where individuals with a specific biological profile receive and benefit from a targeted therapy. We propose to use data from a large, established cohort of patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (the Early Assessment of Renal and Lung Injury [EARLI] cohort) to define sub-phenotypes of SA-AKI using latent class analysis. Latent class analysis is an established method that uses mixture models to identify sub- phenotypes within a heterogenous population in an unbiased manner. Prior work using this methodology has allowed for discovery of new disease entities that inform biological pathways of cellular injury leading to organ failure. Our specific aims are: Aim 1: To identify novel sub-phenotypes of patients with SA-AKI and discover molecular targets for therapy through the incorporation of clinical and biomarker data into our latent class analysis. Aim 2: To determine whether certain sub-phenotypes are associated with differential outcomes with regards to mortality, need for renal replacement therapy, or duration of AKI. Through the studies outlined in this F32 proposal, Dr. Kwong will learn how to rigorously conduct latent class analysis as well as other unbiased analytic techniques (e.g., machine learning) and to apply these techniques to AKI. This work will effectively position Dr. Kwong for her future research studies, where she wants to identify appropriate patients for clinical trials of AKI therapies and to better define the pathophysiology of human AKI. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sepsis has been shown to be a key contributing factor for the development of acute kidney injury (AKI). To date, there are no available targeted therapies for sepsis-associated AKI besides supportive care with antibiotics and fluids. The long-term goal of this project is to find new therapeutics for sepsis-associated AKI by first identifying sub-phenotypes based on clinical and biomarker profiles that may inform the molecular pathways of injury and then determining their association with adverse outcomes.",Identification of Sub-phenotypes in Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury,9833437,F32DK118870,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Acute Kidney Tubular Necrosis', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Allergic', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Apoptotic', 'Aspirin', 'Asthma', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Circulation', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Developed Countries', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Electrolyte Balance', 'Extrinsic asthma', 'Failure', 'Fibrinolysis', 'Fluid Balance', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunologics', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Oliguria', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Renal function', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk Factors', 'Secondary to', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Subgroup', 'Supportive care', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Urine', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'cell injury', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'hypoperfusion', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'lung injury', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'renal ischemia', 'research study', 'response', 'septic patients', 'targeted treatment', 'tubular necrosis']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2020,81571,0.10072489247071886
"Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood PROJECT SUMMARY Early-onset sepsis (EOS) due to invasive bacterial infection is a leading cause of morbidity in infants and disproportionately affects those born preterm. Accurate diagnosis of EOS remains inadequate. The low sensitivity and delayed time to culture results combined with the poor predictive values of available laboratory markers leads to our inability to rule-out EOS. Thus, infants are exposed to extended duration broad-spectrum empiric antibiotics, which have serious associated adverse consequences such as necrotizing enterocolitis, antibiotic resistant infections, and an altered microbiome. The proposed research will apply proteomics to identify gestational age-specific umbilical cord blood markers toward development of a proposed diagnostic tool with strong negative risk prediction for EOS. Cord blood is promising to identify EOS as it reflects the intrauterine environment where infection originates in preterm birth. In previous work, we found that inflammatory proteins serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein and haptoglobin are substantially elevated in cord blood of preterm infants with culture-confirmed EOS. These data inform our hypothesis that a combination of cord blood proteins provides a signature to differentiate impending EOS and uninfected states. Archived cord blood from infants in an existing longitudinal cohort will be used in a nested case-control design. Aim 1 will measure the cord blood proteome of uninfected infants (controls) across gestational ages using an untargeted proteomics approach to characterize the developmental spectrum. Aim 2(a) will then determine the cord blood proteome signatures of infants with confirmed EOS (cEOS) and culture-negative presumed sepsis (PS). cEOS will be compared to matched controls to identify differentially expressed proteins and candidate markers. PS proteomes will be analyzed to help delineate true infection versus inflammatory subtypes in this heterogeneous group. Bioinformatics pathway analysis may provide novel insights into fetal immune response. Aim 2(b) will determine the best combination of markers to exclude EOS through machine learning decision analysis of proteomics data. Paired placental proteomics in Aim 2(c) will explore origins of fetal inflammation. Aim 3(a) will quantify candidate proteins by an orthogonal immunoassay method. In a validation set of new subjects, Aim 3(b) will measure candidate markers by targeted proteomics and test application of the proposed diagnostic tool. With formal didactics and a mentorship team at Northwestern University with expertise in prematurity, sepsis, biomarker discovery, biostatistics, and decision modeling led by Patrick Seed MD Ph.D., the candidate will gain advanced translational research experience and skills in perinatal research study design, advanced immunology, proteomics, and bioinformatics to further her research agenda. The proposed research and career development will be fundamental towards achieving the candidateâs career goals to: 1) lead a clinical-translational research program on the pathophysiology and host responses of perinatal infection and 2) bring new, reliable sepsis diagnostics to clinical practice, to improve neonatal outcomes through targeted treatment of EOS and antibiotic stewardship. PROJECT NARRATIVE Invasive bacterial infections in newborns carry a high risk of complications and death, yet current diagnostic methods are inaccurate, resulting in the harmful overuse of antibiotics. The proposed work will develop a multi- factor diagnostic model for early-onset neonatal sepsis using umbilical cord blood proteins as biomarkers and enhance our understanding of fetal immune response. These are critical steps toward improving infant health outcomes through both targeted treatment of infection and reduced unnecessary early-life antibiotic exposures.",Molecular Signatures of Early-Onset Neonatal Sepsis in Umbilical Cord Blood,9861218,K23AI139337,"['Acute-Phase Proteins', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Bacterial Antibiotic Resistance', 'Bacterial Infections', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Blood Proteins', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Decision Analysis', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Modeling', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Factor', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early identification', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Exposure to', 'Expression Profiling', 'Fetal Development', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Haptoglobins', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Care', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Mycoses', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal Infection', 'Placenta', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Sepsis', 'Serum Proteins', 'Serum amyloid A protein', 'Set protein', 'Side', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Umbilical Cord Blood', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'adverse outcome', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'biomarker discovery', 'candidate marker', 'career', 'career development', 'case control', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'differential expression', 'early onset', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'fetal', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant morbidity', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbiome alteration', 'neonatal infection', 'neonatal outcome', 'neonatal sepsis', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein biomarkers', 'protein expression', 'research and development', 'research study', 'sex', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'translational research program']",NIAID,LURIE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO,K23,2020,189950,0.07335309679011709
"Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record Project Summary/Abstract Sepsis is a critical illness syndrome characterized by infection leading to life-threatening organ failure. Affecting over 200,000 individuals in the United States each year, sepsis accounts for nearly half of all hospital deaths and over $20 billion in yearly US hospital costs. Despite the development and dissemination of evidence-based guidelines, most patients with sepsis do not consistently receive recommended care, resulting in preventable morbidity and mortality. Consequently, there is increasing interest in implementing health policies designed to incentivize quality improvement at the hospital level. The largest and most prominent of these policies to date is the new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) quality reporting initiative, known as SEP-1. SEP-1 requires hospitals to report their compliance with a variety of evidence-based care processes, including timely antibiotic administration, timely volume resuscitation, and routine monitoring of the clinical response to therapy. SEP-1 is unique among quality measures in the CMS Inpatient Quality Reporting Program, both because it is the only measure based on a critical illness syndrome and because it is of unparalleled complexity, requiring the coordinated efforts of multiple health care providers across the acute care spectrum. As a consequence, it is essential to understand how SEP-1 has affected patient care and clinical outcomes. To address this need, we propose to comprehensively evaluate the impact of the SEP-1 measure using the electronic health record (EHR) of a large multihospital health system. An EHR-based approach will allow us to understand the impact of the policy in exceptional detail, yielding actionable data not only for policy makers seeking to refine SEP-1 but also for health systems seeking to respond to SEP-1 in a way that maximizes the potential benefits. First, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis recognition and documentation using natural language processing of clinical notes. Second, we will analyze the impact of the program on sepsis care processes using structured data elements such as vital signs, laboratory values, and medication administration. Third, we will evaluate the impact of the program on patient mortality, length of stay, and requirement for organ support. In all aims we will examine both overall effects and hospital-specific effects, providing an understanding of how hospitals and health systems implement quality improvement in the context of a novel reporting mandate. Together, these aims will yield important new insights into how clinicians and hospitals implement new quality reporting programs. At the same time, through a program of structured mentorship, career development, and stakeholder involvement, this project will provide the principal investigator with new skills in the use of the EHR to evaluate health care quality and the impact of system-level health policies, uniquely positioning him to lead future efforts to develop, implement, evaluate, and disseminate EHR-based performance interventions for critically ill patients. NARRATIVE Sepsis is a life-threatening response to infection and accounts for significant morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs in the United States. In this proposal, we will use data from the electronic health record of a large health system to evaluate the effects of a novel sepsis quality reporting program on sepsis recognition, treatment, and outcomes. Our findings will yield important early information on the quality reporting programâs impact, helping to guide policy makers as they seek to refine the program and yielding novel insights into strategies to improve sepsis quality in US hospitals.",Evaluating National Sepsis Policy Using the Electronic Health Record,9936306,K08HS025455,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K08,2020,146065,0.2083055227051295
"Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED) PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Pediatric septic shock is a leading cause of childhood death, in which morbidity-free survival depends on timely diagnosis and treatment. Although the medical community, general public and state legislatures have increasingly recognized that delays in diagnosing septic shock in children are an important cause of preventable morbidity, there are no validated predictive models to improve early sepsis diagnosis in children. The candidate, Dr. Halden Scott, is a pediatric emergency physician at Children's Hospital Colorado and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. She has critically evaluated early diagnostic strategies in an Electronic Health Record (EHR)-derived pediatric sepsis registry that she designed that will support the proposed research. She is seeking to develop into an independent health services researcher, through the proposed mentored research with the following goals: 1) Derive and test models to predict septic shock in an existing EHR-derived dataset, comparing models derived with two modern modeling techniques; 2) create an EHR decision support tool for the early recognition of septic shock; 3) conduct a pilot implementation trial of decision support in community and academic pediatric emergency care settings within the Children's Hospital Colorado network. This implementation and feasibility data will inform a future multicenter pragmatic trial of computerized decision support in diagnosis of pediatric septic shock, which Dr. Scott will propose in an R01 application before the end of the K award. Dr. Scott's research trajectory is facilitated and enriched by strong institutional clinical, informatics and administrative support, and her involvement in the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and international sepsis guidelines committees.  This award would support Dr. Scott's career development goals: acquire skills in predictive modeling, the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and pragmatic trials. Dr. Scott's nationally renowned mentors will support these goals: Dr. Kempe, expert in pragmatic trials, program evaluation and implementation research; Dr. Fairclough, expert in statistics and modeling; Dr. Kahn, expert in research and clinical informatics. Additional advisors contribute expertise in machine learning, clinical pediatric emergency research, critical care and sepsis. This proposal responds to AHRQ priorities: improving health care quality through information systems, improving safety and quality by synthesizing evidence, and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs. The research, mentorship and training plan proposed are ideally suited to provide Dr. Scott with the skills needed to develop into an independent health services researcher focused on improving the quality of care for pediatric emergency conditions, particularly sepsis, through the use of health information technology in learning health systems, and conduct of pragmatic trials to test implementation of evidence-based practice in emergency settings. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance  Pediatric septic shock, a leading cause of childhood death, is often recognized late, causing preventable morbidity, and improved early diagnostic approaches would improve the timeliness of sepsis diagnosis, accelerate treatment and improve outcomes. This proposal will provide mentored research training to use predictive modeling to improve early diagnosis of pediatric sepsis, and test the delivery of clinical decision support to clinicians through the electronic health record in an implementation trial. This proposal responds to the AHRQ priorities of improving health care quality through use of information systems, improving safety and quality of care by synthesizing and communicating evidence to health care professionals, advances knowledge generation in a learning health system and focuses on AHRQ priority populations including children and those with chronic care needs.",Enhancing Quality in Pediatrics Sepsis with Shock Prediction and Early Electronic Decision Support (EQUIP with SPEED),9985019,K08HS025696,[' '],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K08,2020,148539,0.16880793272727707
"Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Sepsis Induced Multiple Organ Failure Renewal Carcillo R01 Project Abstract Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call âsepsisâ, and death in up to 1 of 3 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). National efforts emphasizing early recognition, intravenous fluids to help organs, and antibiotics to kill infection, have reduced mortality so that now 1 of 4 die. We and others have asked the question âwhy do patients continue to die despite these national efforts?â In the previous funding period we showed in 401 children with sepsis that those who developed organ shut down despite these efforts, did so because they were a) unable to fight germs causing unending infection, b) unable to stop clotting off their body causing kidney failure, and/or c) unable to kill viruses causing liver failure; all of which led to death from uncontrolled inflammation with clotting, bleeding and liver failure. Fortunately, each of these organ shutdown groups has hopeful treatments. With the new information we collected in the previous funding period we have already designed and started clinical trials testing these treatments including immune boosters for children unable to kill germs, plasma removal and replacement using plasma exchange for children unable to stop clotting, monoclonal antibodies to kill viruses and their homes to reverse liver failure in children unable to do so on their own, and anti-inflammatory proteins to reverse uncontrollable inflammation, in hopes of helping save many of the 1 of 4 children still dying from sepsis related organ shutdown. In this next funding period, we propose to use the clinical information and samples already obtained in our previous study to take advantage of the wonderful advances made this millenia in computer technology, big data, bioinformatics, and the study of human and virus genetics to perform Specific Aim 1) use a âWatsonâ like approach to ask the computer to help us figure out if the children with sepsis have any other causes of organ shutdown that we can help, Specific Aim 2) use an âAncestry.comâ-like or â23 and meâ-like approach to identify âprecision medicineâ therapies for causes of organ shutdown that we can treat on a patient by patient basis, and Specific Aim 3) use a bedside molecular biology test approach to identify individualized therapies to kill DNA viruses and reduce cytokine inflammation. We think that DNA viruses are the unappreciated co-infection which causes uncontrolled cytokine inflammation and leads to organ shutdown. Our long term objective is to plan âprecisionâ medicine and âindividualizedâ medicine clinical trials testing therapies on an individual patient basis in order to further reduce death from sepsis organ shutdown in children. Carcillo R01 Narrative Statement Every year over 1 million American adults and children develop overwhelming infection leading to a rotting of their body we call âsepsisâ, and death in up to 1 of 4 afflicted (www.nigms.nih.gov>NIGMS Home>Science Education). In our previous funding period we showed that this occurs when groups of patients are unable to kill germs, stop clotting or bleeding, or stop viruses from reproducing, and we have therefore designed and begun clinical trials to help these children do so. In this new funding period we are using âWatsonâ-like, âTwenty three and meâ-like, and âAncestry.comâ-like approaches to figure out how to help each child with individually tailored treatments that are best at helping them live long and happy lives.",Inflammation Phenotypes in Pediatric Sepsis Induced Multiple Organ Failure Renewal,10017690,R01GM108618,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adenoviruses', 'Adult', 'American', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antibiotics', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complement', 'Computers', 'Cytomegalovirus', 'DNA', 'DNA Viruses', 'Data', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Excision', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Germ', 'Hemorrhage', 'Herpesvirus 1', 'Home environment', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Herpesvirus 4', 'Human Herpesvirus 6', 'IV Fluid', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Interleukin-1', 'Interleukin-18', 'Interleukin-6', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Liver Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Macrophage activation syndrome', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural Immunity', 'Organ', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Intensive Care Units', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Exchange', 'Precision medicine trial', 'Proteins', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Septic Shock', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Syndrome', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thrombocytopenia', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Viremia', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'adaptive immunity', 'base', 'clinical biomarkers', 'co-infection', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'design', 'exome', 'fighting', 'gene interaction', 'genetic analysis', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'science education', 'septic patients', 'targeted treatment', 'trial design', 'virus genetics']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,500320,0.1171818018501187
