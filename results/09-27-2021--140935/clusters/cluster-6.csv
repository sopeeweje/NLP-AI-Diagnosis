"Toward Precision Medicine for Substance Use Disorders with Co-Occurring PTSD - A Machine Learning Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 20 years of empirical data document the individual and societal costs of co-occurring substance use disorders (SUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although evidence-based treatments are available for SUD+PTSD, the lack of methods or guidelines for personalized treatment recommendations represents a critical barrier to progress in the field. Secondary analyses of existing treatment research datasets have the promise to identify cost-effective and noninvasive variables that represent predictors, moderators, mediators, mechanisms of action, and secondary effects in a way that can be easily replicated in research and expanded to the real world. Importantly, extant datasets provide an opportunity to develop and test innovative analytic approaches that leverage technological advances in computing power to: 1) develop precision medicine algorithms that can prognosticate and prescribe at the patient-level, 2) generate new hypotheses to guide future research on treatment development and dissemination, and 3) innovate existing methods that can be applied to solve related problems in the field. Accordingly, the proposed project will apply machine learning methodologies to the largest existing NIDA-funded multi-site clinical trial for SUD+PTSD in order to: Aim 1: Develop algorithms that can identify the probability of treatment response on both SUD and PTSD outcomes based on routinely collected intake data. Aim 2: Identify key variables associated with a significant increase or decrease in the treatment response probability. Aim 3: Assess the feasibility of providing data-driven, personalized prescriptions that fit patients to the treatment most likely to benefit them based on their individual profile. The proposed machine learning analyses will be developed by the applicant at the Anxiety and Health Behaviors Laboratory of The University of Texas at Austin, and evaluated at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC), which houses the fastest academic supercomputer in the United States of America, and one of the most powerful systems in the world. Importantly, the algorithms (once developed) can be easily disseminated and do not require powerful hardware to execute. Therefore, the combination of advanced machine learning analyses and high-performance computing has the promise to provide methods and findings that can be expanded across extant datasets and future research projects to facilitate scientific discovery in the field of personalized medicine for addiction that: 1) goes beyond comparing mean response across treatments, and 2) that is otherwise not possible with traditional statistical methods. If successful, the project will support a strategy that represents a paradigm shift from one-size-fits-all recommendations derived from treatment comparisons in clinical trials, to a data-driven, precision medicine approach that prognosticates and prescribes at the patient level. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project will apply machine learning methodologies to the largest existing NIDA-funded multi-site clinical trial for substance use disorders (SUD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). If the project is successful, it will be the first to: 1) develop algorithms that can identify the probability of treatment response on both SUD and PTSD outcomes based on routinely collected intake data, 2) identify key variables associated with a significant increase or decrease in the probability for treatment response, and 3) assess the feasibility of providing data-driven prescriptions that fit patients to the treatment most likely to benefit them based on their individual profile.",Toward Precision Medicine for Substance Use Disorders with Co-Occurring PTSD - A Machine Learning Approach,9809511,R36DA049122,"['Address', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Americas', 'Anxiety', 'Clinical Trials', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dropout', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'High Performance Computing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Predictive Value', 'Probability', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Trauma', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'addiction', 'analytical method', 'anxiety treatment', 'austin', 'base', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'outcome forecast', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predicting response', 'profiles in patients', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'societal costs', 'suicidal risk', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'therapy development', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R36,2019,49534,0.0547591026716503
"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9761396,R01AA018673,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Empathy', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Homicide', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical implementation', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'visual feedback', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2019,587565,0.005363038254433482
"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). This node will draw on an experienced set of investigators who have active collaborations and represent all of the major academic medical centers in the Greater Chicago and Wisconsin areas. The node will serve as a vital Midwestern hub for the CTN and will expand on the success of the CTN approach. In addition, the GLN will bring substantial experience in adolescent/young adult research, seniors/aging research, digital & mobile technologies, opioid misuse, collaborative care/population health, telehealth, and electronic health record and systems-driven interventions and research methodologies. The GLN will support engagement with CTN protocols and also add the following: Aim 1: GLN will identify and recommend substance misuse research and intervention protocols focused on systems-based practice using hospital-based screening, collaborative care, and population approaches. Aim 2: We will establish a digital and computation health core that will leverage our expertise in these domains and serve as a conduit for studies in mHealth, eHealth, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and telehealth interventions. Aim 3: Our node will bring substantial expertise with youth/adolescent health and seniors/aging that will enable us to recommend studies to the CTN that examine the genesis of substance misuse and the potential for prevention strategies to mitigate these life-course pathways. Aim 4: In alignment with our teamâs expertise, we plan to support work on substance and opioid misuse that focuses on health disparities including socioeconomic, geographic, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Aim 5: Leveraging our experience in professional education and practice-based learning, our node will rigorously test the impact of professional education on opioid and substance treatment. We have built on the ECHO model to develop methods to conduct high-quality distance education and supported training that are currently being trialed in Illinois with plans to expand these programs nationally. Aim 6: GLN will expand the pipeline of early investigators interested in substance misuse research. We will align this part of our program with our very successful CTSA-supported programs and build specific subprogramming that supports addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship. Project Narrative This application will establish the Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network. The creation of this node will help facilitate research on substance and opioid misuse which are key components of NIH and federal government strategy to reduce the mortality and morbidity associated with the current opioid and substance epidemics. This node will support clinical trials relevant to the epidemics and also advance research in novel models of care, data analytics, mobile interventions and training.",Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,9839124,UG1DA049467,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adolescent', 'African American', 'Aging', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asians', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chicago', 'Cities', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data Analytics', 'Distance Education', 'Drug abuse', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Epidemic', 'Federal Government', 'Gender Identity', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Heroin', 'Home environment', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitals', 'Illinois', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Latino', 'Learning', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Los Angeles', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Midwestern United States', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Native Americans', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Opioid', 'Opioid Analgesics', 'Pacific Island Americans', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Professional Education', 'Professional Practice', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Refugees', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Rural', 'Sex Orientation', 'Side', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Veterans', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Wisconsin', 'Work', 'addiction', 'adolescent health', 'base', 'collaborative care', 'cooking', 'digital', 'eHealth', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'interest', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'metropolitan', 'mobile computing', 'mortality', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid treatment program', 'overdose death', 'population health', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial diversity', 'rural area', 'screening', 'sexual identity', 'socioeconomics', 'substance misuse', 'suburb', 'success', 'telehealth', 'urban area', 'waiver', 'young adult']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UG1,2019,444441,0.07827203255695225
"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",9734801,R01DA048764,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'arm', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'non-compliance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2019,422197,0.046663210826527746
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample of 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,9683972,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2019,735621,0.06872675352853916
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9625118,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2019,162123,0.038290047379223105
"Wiring Adolescents With Social Anxiety via Behavioral Interventions (WASABI): a closed-loop mobile intervention to reduce social anxiety and improve social skills PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of this project is to further develop (to pivotal trial readiness) and evaluate WASABI (Wiring Adolescents With Social Anxiety via Behavioral Interventions)âa clinician-assisted, adjunct to treatment, mobile application designed to augment the efficacy of psychological Evidence Based Treatments through a closed-loop technology. In this project, we will build upon promising results obtained from two studies in anxiety and psychosis, leverage pilot data collected in adolescents with Social Anxiety (SA), and test WASABI as an adjunct to digital Cognitive Behavioral Group Therapy (dCBGT). Via Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) WASABI will capture data on social anxiety, its underlying cognitive biases, and on social role performance. These data will populate a predictive machine learning algorithm that will alert the WASABI clinician and end- user of whenever social anxiety reaches clinical significance. The clinician will use this information to initiate synchronous or asynchronous Instant Messaging (IM)-based conversations with the goal of supporting, recommending and reinforcing relevant skills to alleviate the momentary distress, to increase social competence, and/or to improve contextual social role performance. Similarly, the clinician will leverage WASABI data to personalize dCBGT content during the weekly group video-calls. This individualized assessment, monitoring, and treatment approach is posited to induce flexible adaptive long-term learning about social-emotional events, and support the generalization of trained cognitive skills within the everyday lives of adolescents, thus improving their clinical and functional status. In Specific Aim 1, we will first involve three adolescents with SA and two clinicians in three focus groups that will be organized to refine WASABI and qualitatively evaluate its manageability, clinical usefulness, and acceptability. Once decisions regarding the app and dashboard design are made, the three adolescents will be involved in a 2-week trial run, during which the predictive ability of the algorithm will be validated by the WASABI clinician, who will verify via 1:1 remote videocalls the actual presence of clinically-significant social anxiety whenever she receives an alert. Additionally, the test run will ensure that WASABI EMA data are timely evaluated by the clinician on the dashboard and meaningfully orient the delivery of individualized IM and weekly dCBGT content. At the end of this test run, each stakeholder will be asked to rate enjoyment, ease of use, product quality, and perceived usefulness. Finally, we will submit these data from the trial run to our consultant to confirm that WASABI is suitable for evaluation in the feasibility trial. In Specific Aim 2, to evaluate the acceptability and preliminary efficacy of WASABI, we will conduct a pilot augmentation trial with 32 adolescents with SA who will be randomized to dCBGT+WASABI vs dCBGT only. At the completion of this project we will have usability data sufficient to support a RCT in Phase II designed to establish medical claims defining the efficacy of this intervention. At the completion of Phase II, we will be able to complete the FDA regulatory pathway and have the opportunity to improve the lives of people suffering from this condition. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the current project is to elaborate upon, reconstruct and advance to pivotal trial readiness WASABI (Wiring Adolescents With Social Anxiety via Behavioral Interventions)âa clinician-assisted, adjunct to treatment, mobile application designed to augment the efficacy of psychological evidence-based treatments. By processing Ecological Momentary Assessments data collected from mobile devices, the WASABI closed-loop algorithm detects exacerbation of social anxiety, and cues 1:1 and group-based Instant Messaging with peers and providers. In this Phase I trial, we will test WASABI as an adjunct to digital Cognitive Behavioral Group Therapy in adolescents with Social Anxiety, with the goal of promoting the generalization of trained cognitive skills in the natural environment, thus improving anxiety and social functioning.",Wiring Adolescents With Social Anxiety via Behavioral Interventions (WASABI): a closed-loop mobile intervention to reduce social anxiety and improve social skills,9847582,R43MH121209,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Cellular Phone', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Comorbidity', 'Competence', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Distress', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Focus Groups', 'Future', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Group Therapy', 'Hour', 'Interpersonal Relations', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Notification', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Program Sustainability', 'Provider', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Psychotic Mood Disorders', 'Randomized', 'Readiness', 'Recovery', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Social Functioning', 'Social Interaction', 'Social skills development', 'Standardization', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Waiting Lists', 'Youth', 'adherence rate', 'anxious', 'attenuation', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive skill', 'cognitive training', 'cost effective', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'feeding', 'flexibility', 'functional status', 'handheld mobile device', 'improved', 'learning algorithm', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mobile application', 'multimodality', 'peer', 'phase 2 designs', 'phase I trial', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'psychologic', 'real time monitoring', 'recruit', 'skills', 'social', 'social anxiety', 'social situation', 'social skills', 'usability', 'week trial']",NIMH,POSIT SCIENCE CORPORATION,R43,2019,243975,0.02057243863666882
"Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing Millions of Americans receive evidence-based counseling for substance use problems each year. Many evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are âtalk basedâ therapies, such as motivational interviewing (MI), but the existing research-based methodology for evaluating counseling quality is to record sessions and use human rating teams to evaluate them. However, using humans as the assessment tool via behavioral coding is prohibitive in cost and time, can be error prone, and is virtually never used in the real world. Technology is needed that can analyze the speech patterns and spoken language of counseling sessions, provide automatic and intuitive quality scores, and summarize these in actionable feedback. Rapid, performance-based quality metrics could support training, ongoing supervision, and quality assurance for millions of evidence-based counseling sessions for substance abuse each year. Lyssn.io is a start-up targeting the development of implementation-focused technology to support evidence-based counseling. Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient. Lyssn.io includes expertise in speech signal processing, machine learning, user-centered design, software engineering, and clinical expertise in evidence-based counseling. Previous NIH-funded research laid a computational foundation for generating MI quality metrics from speech and language features in MI sessions, and led to a prototype of a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The current Fast-Track SBIR proposal includes Phase I, which will focus on understanding clinical workflows, assessing usability, and initial validation of machine learning of MI fidelity measures in the opioid treatment program at Evergreen Treatment Services (ETS) clinic in Seattle, WA. Phase II will focus on robust validation of the speech and language technologies underlying the CORE-MI tool, and development of scalable supervision protocols that integrate CORE-MI supported feedback for counselors. Finally, we will conduct a quasi-experimental evaluation of CORE-MI supported supervision and training at a second ETS clinic in the Puget Sound, focusing on acceptability, usability, and adoption, the impact on supervision, improved MI fidelity and preliminary evidence of increased client retention. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance in MI for substance abuse. Most evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are in-person psychotherapy and counseling interventions, such as motivational interviewing. There are currently no methods for evaluating the quality of such counseling interventions in the real world to support training, supervision, and quality assurance. Building on an existing prototype, Lyssn.io â a technology start-up focused on scalable and cost-efficient human-centered technologies â will enhance and evaluate a cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant clinical support software tool that uses automated speech recognition and machine learning in an community based opioid replacement clinic.","Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing",9741887,R44DA046243,"['Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Counseling', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'automated speech recognition', 'automobile accident', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'dashboard', 'design', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'gun homicide', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid treatment program', 'overdose death', 'prediction algorithm', 'protocol development', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'research and development', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'sound', 'speech processing', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment services', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual', 'visual feedback']",NIDA,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R44,2019,553403,-0.013446660528365736
"Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders Project Summary/Abstract Substance use costs society $740 billion dollars each year, placing an enormous burden on our nationâs health care and criminal justice systems. Approximately 85% of incarcerated offenders in the United States have a history of substance use and/or are imprisoned for crimes involving or motivated by alcohol and/or drug use. Incarcerated individuals tend to show poorer outcomes following substance use treatment, and forced abstinence via imprisonment is associated with risk for future substance use, which likely contributes to substance-related antisocial behavior following imprisonment. Over the past few decades, women have been sentenced to prison for drug-related reasons at alarming rates, with a growth rate exceeding that for men. Further, women offenders tend to be impacted more heavily by substance use with co-morbid psychopathology, placing greater demands on the system in terms of substance use and mental health treatments. Using the worldâs largest forensic neuroimaging database on women offenders (SWANC-F), this proposal investigates substance use and related antisocial behavior following release from prison in a large sample of women offenders, with a focus on neurobiological mechanisms, to demonstrate the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women. Substance-related antisocial behavior, defined as committing crime(s) related to substance use after release from prison, will be obtained from re-arrest data in institutional files and comprehensive background checks on all women enrolled in the study. A random sample (n = 100) will then be followed-up with via phone to gather data on substance use and obtain supplemental information to corroborate re-arrest data from files and background checks. Employing regression analyses and machine learning/pattern classifier approaches, models will be compared testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic variables, along with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) brain measures, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes of interest in women. Specifically, this proposal seeks to test the extent to which psychiatric and socioeconomic factors confer risk for substance-related antisocial behavior following release from prison in women (Aim 1), and integrates and compares the utility of rsFC brain measures in improving these prediction models (Aim 2). Then, similar methods will be applied to test the prediction of substance use following release from prison (Aim 3). It is expected that psychiatric risk factors and socioeconomic protective factors, as well as rsFC brain measures, will be useful in predicting substance use and related antisocial behavior following incarceration, along with time elapsed between release from prison and initiation of substance use and related behavior. Testing factors that aid in predicting these behaviors in women has the potential to be far-reaching by informing the development of targeted treatments, including those that help to account for sex differences and co-morbid conditions related to substance use. Project Narrative Women represent one of the fastest growing segments of substance users in the United States, with a growth rate of substance-related offending exceeding that of men; however, women continue to be one of the most underserved populations in substance use research. This proposal will compare statistical models testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic factors, along with resting-state functional connectivity in and between cognitive control, decision-making, and reward-processing neural circuitry, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes in women. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women in an effort to help inform future treatment efforts.","Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders",9758947,F31DA047048,"['4-aminospiroperidol', 'Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fibrinogen', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prisons', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offender', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'psychopathic personality', 'reward processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2019,35547,0.14576771345822978
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 â those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 â risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9636556,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sexual risk behavior', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2019,168497,0.04359375393575959
"Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone (ExTENd) trial, a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for those who are non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. One of the main challenges in this trial is the presence of the many variables available for consideration when making treatment decisions at each stage of the trial. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the ExTENd trial data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of a dynamic treatment regime (DTR) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal DTR is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Q-learning can be used with data from both SMARTs and observational studies to estimate an optimal DTR. However, like other model-based approaches, model misspecification can seriously affect the results and lead to the identification of suboptimal DTRs. The potential for misspecification increases with the number of variables that may influence treatment decisions through, e.g., incorrect assumptions on the relationship of variables to the outcome and the inclusion (exclusion) of unimportant (important) variables. These features represent the main analytical challenges for the ExTENd trial. We propose a new approach to Q-learning that leverages machine learning approaches to reduce the chances of misspecifying the relationship between the expected outcome and a given set of variables. We also develop a variable selection technique specifically designed for Q-learning that enables investigators to select the important variables from a long list of possibilities (e.g., genetic and demographic information, medical history over time) when estimating an optimal DTR. In both settings, we will develop new methods for conducting valid inferences (e.g., confidence intervals and p-values), including when there exist patients for whom treatment is neither beneficial nor harmful at a given decision stage (i.e., when an important technical assumption, âuniquenessâ, is violated). Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available software in the R language that implements our methods. This will allow re-analysis of the ExTENd trial data with a goal of constructing a DTR that improves upon the current rescue treatment strategy for those non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. It will also provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal DTRs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for estimating the optimal treatment regime in substance use disorder. We will develop a variable selection technique that enables investigators to select important variables for the decision- making process among a long list of variables (e.g., patientâs genetic information, demographic characteristics, and medical history over time). We will also leverage statistical machine learning approaches to improve the quality of the constructed optimal treatment regimes while providing valid statistical inference.",Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers,9721702,R21AA027571,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dose', 'Exclusion', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical History', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'falls', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'overtreatment', 'personalized medicine', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2019,237402,0.04863829596538178
"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for alcohol and substance use problems called motivational interviewing.",Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9692448,K02AA023814,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Software', 'American', 'Applied Skills', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disease classification', 'drinking', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'global health', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2019,131850,0.010706051402929816
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naÃ¯ve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on the effects of adolescent marijuana use on working memory, inhibitory control and corticostriatal systems.",ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project,9691298,U01DA041028,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent marijuana use', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biologic Development', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'behavioral health', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'time use', 'translational research program', 'trend']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2019,990000,0.2041273886855223
"Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) are at increased risk for numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, substance use, HIV/AIDS, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Despite clear documentation and replication of these health disparities, relatively little is known about their development from adolescence into adulthood. Two theories primarily dominate the literature. Minority stress models describe unique life stressors experienced only by sexual minorities (e.g., victimization and discrimination based on sexual orientation) as primary contributors to health disparities. Other models implicate both minority stress and normative psychosocial processes together as contributors to health disparities. Some such normative processes include (1) psychological adjustment and characteristics (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, substance use expectancies), (2) disrupted social systems (e.g., family, peers, school), and (3) individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, temperament). To date, most studies of both minority stress and normative processes are limited by use of cross-sectional samples of primarily Caucasian adults. Although much has been learned from these studies, they do not permit analysis of emerging health disparities across development. Existing research is therefore limited in terms of both generalizability to diverse populations, and validity of directionality inferences between observed âpredictorsâ and âoutcomesâ. My long-term career goals are to identify mechanisms leading to disparities among sexual minorities, with the goal of improving treatments for these disparities, and to develop screening tools to identify high-risk youth who would benefit from prevention programs. To reach this goal, in this project, I address existing limitations to the literature using a prospective sample of individuals who were 14-19 years old at baseline and followed for over 4 years. My goal is to describe developmental trajectories and mechanisms of health disparity development for sexual minority youth compared with heterosexual youth across a 10-year developmental window spanning ages 14- 23 years. Longitudinal outcomes include depression/anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, sleep, general physical health, disordered eating and substance use. Developmental trajectories for these outcomes will be charted by gender and sexual orientation. Confirmatory analyses based on existing literature will be conducted to examine relations between minority stress and adverse outcomes. Then, I will use machine learning to identify as-yet unknown predictors of adverse outcomes and health disparities and characterize any changes in prediction across time. Finally, I will use state-of-the art intervening variable analyses (mediation, moderation) to evaluate longitudinal mechanisms through which health disparities emerge. Findings should provide insight into mechanisms of disparity development and maintenance, informing prevention and intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) experience wide-ranging disparities in mental and physical health that often persist into adulthood, yet little is known about development of these disparities. This research (1) examines developmental trajectories in mental and physical health outcomes from adolescence to young adulthood among sexual minority and matched heterosexual youth, (2) uses advanced statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to identify hypothesized and currently unknown factors that predict disparities over time, and (3) elucidates pathways to adversity and resilience. Experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual youth and young adults will be compared to uncover possible differences in developmental experiences that lead to health disparities, with possible implications for prevention and intervention among a highly vulnerable population.",Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing,9760277,F31MD014052,"['19 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Asthma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Documentation', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expectancy', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterosexuals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spirituality', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Victimization', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'emerging adult', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'non-heterosexual', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer victimization', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'resilience', 'sexual identity', 'sexual minority', 'sexual risk behavior', 'social', 'stressor', 'substance misuse', 'theories', 'treatment disparity', 'young adult']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,33183,0.023544219530733667
"MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing. ABSTRACT As rates of adolescent depression and suicidality continue to trend upwards, the healthcare system struggles to address the need for and lack of mental health service use. The pediatric patient-centered medical home model may improve adolescent depression outcomes by enhancing access to and coordinating care, as well as providing ongoing monitoring. Unfortunately, despite guideline recommendations, over 2/3 of adolescents identified with depression symptoms in primary care do not receive symptom monitoring and 19% do not re- ceive symptom reassessment. This lack of symptom monitoring and reassessment can result in untoward health outcomes including a decrease in functioning, increased use of acute and crisis services, and hospitali- zations due to suicidality. Current technologies which incorporate data passively collected from smartphones offer an opportunity for intercurrent monitoring between patient visits which limits burden on the patient to self- report and limits burden on the healthcare system, allowing primary care teams to triage contacting and as- sessing patients a system identifies with an increase in disease severity. This formative study will demonstrate the usability and potential clinical utility of MoodRing, a technology intervention which will collect passive mo- bile phone sensor data on aspects of adolescent phone use related to depressive symptom severity (e.g. com- munication patterns, social media use, travel) and integrate this data into a multi-user (adolescent, parent, pri- mary care provider/care manager) platform from which symptoms can be viewed and secure communication can occur. MoodRing, as supported by Health Belief Model, may lead to improved quality of depression man- agement (increased symptom reassessment, therapy/medication adherence) through increasing self-efficacy, social support from parent and care team, as well as encouraging application of self-management skills through increased self-management knowledge, skills, and symptom feedback. MoodRing builds on a solid foundation of investigators experienced in design of technology interventions to increase adolescent initiation of depression treatment, who have already developed machine algorithms for passive sensing and a small business partner with vast experience in working with health researchers to develop multi-user web/mobile platforms. This STTR Phase I study seeks to accomplish two aims. The first is to apply a machine learning pipeline developed for college-aged youth to adolescents with depression and determine whether self-reported depressive symptoms can be reliably predicted from passive data with at least 85% accuracy. The second is the user design and system architecture of MoodRing. If milestones are achieved that models are successful at predicting depressive symptoms and the proposed MoodRing intervention is acceptable to adolescents, par- ents, and primary care providers/care managers, then we will pursue the STTR Phase II study. The aims of Phase II include the development and subsequent efficacy trial of MoodRing. Specifically, we will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial in a primary care setting of MoodRing as compared to usual care. PROJECT NARRATIVE Depression affects up to a fifth of adolescents but less than half get treatment. This project aims to develop and design MoodRing, a technology platform, which will gather information about how an adolescent uses their mobile phone and translate that into what it means about symptoms of depression they are experiencing. This platform will provide symptom feedback to the adolescent themselves, their parent, and their healthcare pro- vider, with the goal that having awareness of symptoms and a safe place to communicate with parents and healthcare providers will allow for more adolescents to better self-manage their mood and get better quality treatment for depression.",MoodRing: A multi-stakeholder platform to monitor and manage adolescents' depression in primary care with passive mobile sensing.,9908603,R44MH122067,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Bile fluid', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Cellular Phone', 'Childhood', 'Clinic Visits', 'Clinical', 'Cluster randomized trial', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Cost Savings', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Reporting', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Income', 'Individual', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Secure', 'Self Efficacy', 'Self Management', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Social support', 'Solid', 'Suicide', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Travel', 'Triage', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'aged', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'child depression', 'clinical decision-making', 'college', 'computer science', 'cost', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'efficacy trial', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'health belief', 'health care service utilization', 'health service use', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'pediatric patients', 'persistent symptom', 'phase 1 study', 'phase 2 study', 'physical conditioning', 'population based', 'primary care setting', 'routine screening', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'sensor', 'skills', 'sleep quality', 'social media', 'suicide rate', 'system architecture', 'therapy adherence', 'treatment as usual', 'treatment response', 'trend', 'university student', 'usability']",NIMH,NURELM E-BUSINESS SOFTWARE,R44,2019,223419,0.044269820182788716
"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for âjust-in-timeâ tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to âlearnâ from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive âjust-in-timeâ interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments.

"Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI) Project Summary/Abstract  Substance misuse is inconsistently addressed in routine medical practice. Primary care physicians frequently fail to diagnose substance abuse when presented with early symptoms of alcohol or drug use. Patients report that less than one-third of primary care physicians carefully screen them for substance abuse, in spite of available and effective screening protocols. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an integrated, evidence-based approach aimed at delivering early intervention for drug and alcohol misuse in medical settings and has been demonstrated to reduce substance misuse. Motivational Interviewing (MI), an underlying component of SBIRT, is an evidence-based, brief interventional approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors. Unfortunately, the MI approach is very difficult to teach to practitioners as it is counterintuitive to most providers who commonly take a directive approach with patients. Because of ineffective training, MI and SBIRT are under-utilized.  The primary goal of this project is to transform MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that analyzes practitioner responses and gives immediate feedback to improve MI skills. Our team has been developing and testing a training tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI). ReadMI is a low cost, ultra-portable solution for accurate and automatic real-time assessment of dialog during the course of MI training. It makes use of the latest advances in deep-learning-based speech recognition and mobile and cloud computing technologies to enable instantaneous MI training assessment and analysis. Currently functioning with 92% accuracy, ReadMI provides immediate feedback to MI and SBIRT trainees regarding the number of open- and closed-ended questions asked, provider-vs-patient conversation time, and other integral components of MI.  ReadMI will advance the skill development of physicians and other healthcare professionals in their use of MI and SBIRT, minimizing the need for time-consuming reviews of recorded training sessions. Our aims are: 1) develop ReadMI to provide MI training metrics with 95% accuracy and 2) test ReadMI in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 200 medical students and residents, 100 who will receive SBIRT/MI training with ReadMI and 100 who will serve as the control group, receiving customary SBIRT/MI training.  The prospective applications of ReadMI extend far beyond substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, detection, and intervention. The effectiveness of all chronic disease management is largely dependent on patient behavior. MI is a patient-focused conversation between the provider and the patient that reinforces the patient's motivation to make positive changes in health-related behavior. By making efficient MI training available to more health professionals, ReadMI will improve healthcare quality as providers are better equipped in their efforts to help patients make healthy lifestyle changes. Project Narrative Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors, including substance misuse. However, MI and a specific application of MI to substance misuse known as SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) are underutilized because of inadequate training of health professionals. This research aims to revolutionize MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that uses natural language processing to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI).",Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI),9824096,R21HS026548,[' '],AHRQ,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,174994,0.061858677570483675
"Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY: A key challenge in combating the opioid epidemic has been connecting individuals with opioid use disorder to evidence-based treatments. The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (âtele- SUDâ) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD. However, despite the widespread interest and growing use, there has never been a rigorous assessment of tele-SUD. For example, what are the different tele-SUD models being used to treat opioid use disorder, what barriers exist to greater use of tele-SUD, and is tele-SUD use associated with improved (or potentially worse) quality of care for people with opioid use disorder? To fill this knowledge gap, we propose a comprehensive national evaluation of telemedicine for opioid use disorder using data through 2021 from Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial insurance as well as a series of qualitative interviews. Our Aims are to: (1) describe the different models of how tele-SUD is being incorporated into opioid use disorder care and how this is changing over time, (2) identify regional factors associated with greater tele-SUD use for opioid use disorder, (3) examine the association between tele-SUD use and quality of opioid use disorder care received and whether this varies by model, and (4) describe existing tele-SUD programs, and identify barriers and facilitators to tele-SUD adoption and sustainability. The proposed mixed-methods study will help providers interested in using tele-SUD and inform ongoing debates about regulations and reimbursement for tele-SUD in Congress and state legislatures. Our goal is to highlight policies and practices that drive greater use of tele-SUD and explore its potential role in improving access to, and quality of, care for individuals with opioid use disorder. Our research will help inform how tele- SUD may be leveraged to combat the opioid epidemic as well as other substance use disorders, such as alcohol and methamphetamine use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Many patients with opioid use disorder have great difficulty accessing substance use disorder (SUD) treatment. Telemedicine for SUD (âtele-SUDâ) is one potential solution, and many states and the Congress are considering laws and regulations to encourage greater tele-SUD use. In this project, our goal is to understand how tele-SUD is being used for patients, what drives the variation in use, whether tele-SUD is associated with better care, and how some providers have successfully used tele-SUD.",Telemedicine for Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder,9835697,R01DA048533,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol consumption', 'American', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Drug Addiction', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Improve Access', 'Individual', 'Insurance', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laws', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Mental disorders', 'Methadone', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Quality of Care', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Role', 'Series', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Telemedicine', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'combat', 'design', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'methamphetamine use', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid mortality', 'opioid use disorder', 'programs', 'randomized trial', 'rural area', 'screening', 'treatment duration']",NIDA,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2019,735192,0.06140586930859487
"Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders PROJECT SUMMARY Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a leading cause of injury and psychological distress among middle school-aged adolescents, and occurs at higher rates in youth exposed to harsh parenting. Tradi- tional intervention programs that target those at risk for perpetrating aggression due to harsh parenting have had only limited success. This lack of success may be due to the fact that aggression is the product of complex decision-making processes that are influenced by current states of attention, arousal, and affect. A different approach is to prevent aggression before it happens by interceding when nonverbal indices signal a shift in these critical states. An essential first step towards establishing this prevention-based approach is to isolate nonverbal behavior that reliably predicts forthcoming aggression in high-risk adolescents. Eye gaze, pupillary dilation, and facial expressions are strong nonverbal behavioral candidates given that they are well-established indices of attention, arousal, and affective states. The current proposal uses computational modeling to test the predictive link between these nonverbal behaviors elicited during an ecologically valid social rejection paradigm and subsequent expression of peer-based aggression in adolescents (11-14 years; N=80) with high and low exposure to harsh parenting. Results will lay the groundwork for our long-term objective, to develop next gen- eration interventions aimed at preventing aggression the moment its behavioral precursors are detected. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a costly public health problem that is inadequately addressed by existing interventions. The goal of this project is to implement computational modeling to predict aggression in low and high-risk youth using nonverbal behavior elicited during social rejection and aggression- related decision-making. Next generation interventions can then be designed to prevent aggression when these nonverbal indices are detected.",Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders,9755465,R21HD093912,"['14 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Anger', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eyelid structure', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical aggression', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Testing', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aggression prevention', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'boys', 'bullying', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'high risk', 'high-risk adolescents', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'junior high school', 'male', 'next generation', 'novel', 'peer', 'physical model', 'predictive test', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'success', 'virtual']",NICHD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R21,2019,192906,0.04832714424677361
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9780580,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2019,7702,0.0932137279888388
"Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal responds to RFA-MH-17-612, âPilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34).â We have shown in several randomized trials that family-focused therapy (FFT) for symptomatic youth at high-risk for bipolar disorder - consisting of psychoeducation and family communication and problem solving skills training - is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in hastening symptomatic recovery. However, between 50%-60% of high-risk youth still have residual mood symptoms and functional impairment after 18 weeks of FFT. In our prior studies, two constructs have emerged as predictors of lack of response to treatment: mood instability in the child and expressed emotion (EE) in parents (i.e., frequent critical comments or hostility). In adolescents (ages 12-18) with a parent with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, we hypothesize that augmenting FFT with frequent and targeted interventions in the home setting through a Smartphone app (MyCoachConnect, or MCC) will (a) have a greater and more rapid impact than standard FFT on the targeted mechanisms of mood instability in adolescents and EE in parents, and (b) as a result, enhance symptom resolution and functioning in adolescents. To be eligible, adolescents must score high on parent-rated measures of mood instability, and have at least one parent who is high-EE by speech sample coding criteria. The MCC app will record weekly open speech samples from parents and children and daily and weekly mood ratings from adolescents. The app assessments will be fed back to the FFT clinician, who will use this information to âpushâ recommendations for mood regulation, communication, and problem-solving strategies (linked to the FFT modules) for parents and youth. In year 1, we will conduct an open trial (n=25) to determine (a) the feasibility and acceptability of FFT with mobile coaching (FFT-MCC), as given by clinicians in community settings, and (b) associations between online/speech feature proxies of the targets (mood instability and EE as measured weekly by MCC) and standard measures of the targets. In years 2 and 3 we will conduct a 75- case RCT in which families are assigned to FFT with MCC skills coaching, FFT with MCC assessments only, with no coaching; or FFT Only, without MCC. We hypothesize that FFT-MCC will be acceptable to parents, adolescents and clinicians, and more effective than FFT without MCC coaching or FFT-Only in engaging the targets of mood instability and EE and promoting improvements in adolescents' mood symptoms and quality of life over 27 weeks. The study will facilitate the translation of a technological augmentation to an evidence-based family intervention, with the goal of increasing treatment access among families with mood disorders. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a 12-session evidence- based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC âreal timeâ assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity.

In this proposal, the investigators intend to deploy the RAE system- consisting of a wearable sensor, a smartphone app, and a clinical portal- to provide individuals in recovery and their treatment providers with an opportunity to identify moments of high risk for relapse and to access real time intervention opportunities. Wearable biosensors are small, noninvasive devices that continuously record physiology. These sensors have the ability to detect digital biomarkers of drug use and stress, the latter of which herald an increased risk of relapse. RAE aims to utilize this capability to create a real-time solution for individuals in recovery. The components of RAE are: 1) The Empatica Embrace, a wrist mounted sensor similar in form factor to a smart watch, that continuously monitors skin temperature, electrodermal activity (EDA) and locomotion. Detection algorithms for stress and drug use will be embedded on the Embrace firmware. 2) The RAE smartphone application (app), for the individual in recovery. The app will be triggered either by detection of an event on the Embrace or manually by the user when needed and will provide multiple options for annotations, stress reduction techniques and immediate contact with individuals in the pre-defined support system via call or SMS text. The app will also log sleep, physical activity, and geographic location of events. 3) The RAE Portal, for the treatment provider, will deliver immediate alerts when an event is detected on the userâs device for the opportunity to intervene in real time and will also provide metrics on the userâs recorded activities. The research plan has two Specific Aims: Aim 1) To deploy and optimize the RAE system in a population of individuals in treatment for substance use disorder and Aim 2) To demonstrate the impact of the RAE system on outcomes in substance use treatment. To achieve these aims the investigators will first deploy the technology in a population of individuals in recovery and collect data on accuracy, usability and functionality (Aim 1). The data from Aim 1 will be used to optimize the system and achieve millstones prior to transition to Aim 2 which will include sensitivity, specify, accuracy and user compliance targets. The investigators will then undertake a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (Aim 2) to evaluate the efficacy of RAE on key outcomes including rates of relapse, retention in treatment programs, and psychosocial wellbeing. The investigators have assembled a leadership team and advisory team with the necessary expertise in business, medicine, wearable technology and engineering to develop RAE into a tool that dramatically improves the success of treatment for substance use disorder, promotes sustained sobriety, and reduces morbidity and mortality from relapse to substance use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Morbidity and mortality related to substance use disorder has reached staggering proportions, and treatment options suffer from high rates of relapse. RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage) is a mobile based solution that combines a wearable sensor, a smartphone app and a cloud based clinical portal to detect stress and drug use in individuals in treatment for substance use disorder. The goal of the RAE system is to provide real-time intervention tools for patients, to allow clinicians to personalize the treatment approach for each patient, and ultimately to reduce morbidity and mortality from substance use disorder by improving the success of treatment programs.","RAE (Realize, Analyze, Engage)- A Digital Biomarker Based Detection and Intervention System for Stress and Craving During Recovery from Substance Abuse Disorders",9545385,R44DA046151,"['Advisory Committees', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Businesses', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Drug usage', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Explosion', 'Foundations', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Italy', 'Journals', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Location', 'Locomotion', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Precipitating Factors', 'Predisposition', 'Provider', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Project Summaries', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Skin Temperature', 'Sleep', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stream', 'Stress', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Support System', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'User Compliance', 'Wireless Technology', 'Wrist', 'active method', 'addiction', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'craving', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'improved', 'mobile application', 'mortality', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'relapse risk', 'sensor', 'service providers', 'signal processing', 'smart watch', 'smartphone Application', 'sobriety', 'software development', 'stress management', 'stress reduction', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'usability', 'wearable device', 'wearable technology']",NIDA,"CONTINUEYOU, LLC",R44,2019,224991,0.09086194990465873

"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of ânon-monotoneâ missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ï¬awed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ï¬xed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiï¬c domains, making âstress-testingâ to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiï¬c reporting. Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Narrative We will develop, implement and disseminate an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software tool to evaluate the robustness to missing data assumptions of clinical trials in which binary outcomes are collected at ï¬xed points over time but where participants intermittently miss their scheduled assess- ments, as frequently occurs in addiction research. We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make âstress-testingâ to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiï¬c reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9756356,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,486320,0.10547693717905207
"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9538549,R01AA018673,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Empathy', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Homicide', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical implementation', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'visual feedback', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,602663,0.005363038254433482
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9427988,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2018,162800,0.038290047379223105
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 â those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 â risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9424658,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sex risk', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2018,171483,0.04359375393575959
"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for alcohol and substance use problems called motivational interviewing.",Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9477551,K02AA023814,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Software', 'American', 'Applied Skills', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disease classification', 'drinking', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'global health', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2018,136230,0.010706051402929816
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naÃ¯ve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

"mHealth intervention for ART adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is an adolescent medicine specialist and Director of Adolescent HIV Services at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with a research focus on using mobile technology to improve adherence and other health outcomes for adolescents at risk for and living with HIV/AIDS. The candidate proposes a career development program that will provide her with the skills and experience to become an independent investigator in the field of adolescent HIV research. In addition to didactic coursework in quantitative and qualitative research methodology and health behavior theory, the candidate's career development will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of nationally recognized advisors committed to her success. [She will form a Technology Advisory Board for mentorship and preceptorships in all aspects of mobile health (mHealth) technology, including incubation and development of technology-based health interventions, study design and analysis techniques for big data/machine learning, gamification theory, user interface/responsive design techniques, usability testing, and the application of health behavior theory to develop mHealth interventions.] Career development activities will be complemented by practical experience gained through the conduct of original research. This proposal examines key health behaviors of medication adherence and sexual risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV/AIDS, and proposes to develop a mobile phone based intervention targeted at improving these health behaviors in the real times and places youth need support. AIM 1 will describe the incidence of STI co-infections and virologic failure and report the standardized risk of these outcomes across strata of HIV+ YMSM through retrospective chart review augmented by in-depth structured interviews for further understanding of key psychosocial and behavioral factors. Using focus groups of youth at high- and low-risk, selected based on findings from AIM 1, AIM 2 will explore how HIV+ YMSM use mobile technology, and their attitudes towards various mobile phone-based tools to improve adherence and reduce sexual risk. Delphi methodology will first be used in AIM 3 to convene a panel of mHealth and adolescent health experts to establish consensus guidelines for adolescent sexual health technology-based intervention development. These results, combined with youth input from AIM 2, will serve as a guiding framework for development of a new mHealth secondary prevention intervention for HIV+ YMSM. The new mHealth intervention composed of theory-driven elements, for example, including time and location-based reminders, and individual and group-based gaming incentives will then undergo usability testing consisting of (a) a focus group for specific feedback on design and user experience and then (b) a 12-month feasibility trial where 20 youth will have the application installed and usage, satisfaction, and clinical outcome data will be collected. In line with NIMH's research priorities, this proposal sets out to develop an innovative secondary prevention strategy targeting improved medication adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed mentored award supports the career development of the candidate into an independent patient- oriented researcher focused on improving the health of adolescents living with and at-risk for HIV/AIDS. The project aims to develop a new secondary prevention intervention, using mobile phone-based technologies, for HIV+ young men who have sex with men (YMSM), targeting key behaviors of sexual risk-taking and poor medication adherence. This research is highly relevant to public health as it targets improving health outcomes of HIV+ youth and preventing new infections among YMSM who are most disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic in the US.",mHealth intervention for ART adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM,9537677,K23MH102128,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Complement', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Delphi Study', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosyphilis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Preceptorship', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Reduction', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Services', 'Sexual Health', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Network', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'adolescent health outcomes', 'adolescent sexual health', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'co-infection', 'demographics', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'feasibility trial', 'follow-up', 'health application', 'high risk men', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'men', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive tract', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'sex risk', 'sexual risk taking', 'skills', 'success', 'technology development', 'theories', 'therapy adherence', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'usability', 'virology', 'young man', 'young men who have sex with men']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K23,2018,180155,0.039283600101963315
"Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions ABSTRACT Bullying is a preventable public health problem that can have long-lasting health, academic and social consequences. Bullying affects between 18% and 31% of adolescents and has been associated with serious negative consequences including depression, substance use, and academic failure for both the perpetrator and target. Over the past decade, bullying behavior has expanded into the digital realm and is known as cyberbullying. Cyberbullying stories have had frequent coverage by news organizations, including coverage of teens whose death from suicide was attributed to cyberbullying. Previous work illustrates the influence of news stories on individualâs attitudes and experiences. News organization coverage has been influential to readers in areas such as suicide, infectious disease outbreaks such as H1N1 flu, and tobacco use. Little is known whether and how adolescents and their families perceive or utilize news coverage of bullying or cyberbullying. News media may be an untapped resource to promote bullying prevention messages and strategies. Our long- term goal is to develop and test interventions to improve bullying prevention and intervention efforts working with media. Towards that goal, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news organization coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families. First, we will evaluate youth and parent perspectives on lay media coverage of bullying using qualitative interviews with 50 participants: 25 diverse adolescents age 15-18 years and 25 parent/guardians of these adolescents. Second, we will assess the current state of the narrative in news media coverage of bullying. We will identify a sample of 500 news articles from print/online media that cover bullying over the past 5 years and conduct content analysis using natural language processing. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software we will evaluate the proportion of words that represent fear-based reporting such as alarmist words (e.g. epidemic, tragic), as well as words that represent public health-oriented messages such as prevention. We will also compare news coverage of bullying to cyberbullying. After analyzing data from these two aims, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 journalists. Our third aim is to synthesize these findings and identify strategies for future interventions that are feasible and acceptable to journalists. We will work with 3 consultants from the fields of communication and journalism to identify and engage journalists (n=30) in qualitative interviews. When these interconnected study aims are successfully completed, outcomes will include a comprehensive understanding of how adolescents and their parents understand and utilize news coverage of bullying, the current state of bullying and cyberbullying news coverage narrative, and perspectives of journalists on intervention approaches that are feasible and acceptable. We will utilize these findings towards novel intervention approaches, such as to leverage news coverage towards enhancing prevention of bullying. PROJECT NARRATIVE Previous studies have shown that news media coverage of health issues can change attitudes and behaviors; for example, journalistsâ approach to suicide can have significant impact on bereaved families and at-risk youth. News media can also complement public health efforts, such as through coverage of tobacco harms that have been shown to prevent smoking among adolescents. Bullying is a significant public health issues that can lead to short and long-term health effects and is frequently covered by news media; thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families towards developing future interventions.",Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions,9551054,R21HD090221,"['Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemic', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Priorities', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Influentials', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Journalism', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoking', 'Suicide', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'bullying', 'bullying prevention', 'contagion', 'cyberbullying', 'digital', 'experience', 'flu', 'health organization', 'improved', 'news', 'novel', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'sexual minority', 'social', 'social stigma', 'success', 'suicidal morbidity']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2018,184819,-0.015894238771642366
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9568354,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2018,58654,0.0932137279888388
"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of ânon-monotoneâ missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ï¬awed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ï¬xed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiï¬c domains, making âstress-testingâ to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiï¬c reporting. Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Narrative We will develop, implement and disseminate an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software tool to evaluate the robustness to missing data assumptions of clinical trials in which binary outcomes are collected at ï¬xed points over time but where participants intermittently miss their scheduled assess- ments, as frequently occurs in addiction research. We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make âstress-testingâ to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiï¬c reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9576900,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,543369,0.10547693717905207
"Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders PROJECT SUMMARY Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a leading cause of injury and psychological distress among middle school-aged adolescents, and occurs at higher rates in youth exposed to harsh parenting. Tradi- tional intervention programs that target those at risk for perpetrating aggression due to harsh parenting have had only limited success. This lack of success may be due to the fact that aggression is the product of complex decision-making processes that are influenced by current states of attention, arousal, and affect. A different approach is to prevent aggression before it happens by interceding when nonverbal indices signal a shift in these critical states. An essential first step towards establishing this prevention-based approach is to isolate nonverbal behavior that reliably predicts forthcoming aggression in high-risk adolescents. Eye gaze, pupillary dilation, and facial expressions are strong nonverbal behavioral candidates given that they are well-established indices of attention, arousal, and affective states. The current proposal uses computational modeling to test the predictive link between these nonverbal behaviors elicited during an ecologically valid social rejection paradigm and subsequent expression of peer-based aggression in adolescents (11-14 years; N=80) with high and low exposure to harsh parenting. Results will lay the groundwork for our long-term objective, to develop next gen- eration interventions aimed at preventing aggression the moment its behavioral precursors are detected. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aggression linked to peer-based rejection and bullying is a costly public health problem that is inadequately addressed by existing interventions. The goal of this project is to implement computational modeling to predict aggression in low and high-risk youth using nonverbal behavior elicited during social rejection and aggression- related decision-making. Next generation interventions can then be designed to prevent aggression when these nonverbal indices are detected.",Using Adolescent Nonverbal Behavior to Predict Aggression Against Bullies and Bystanders,9791513,R21HD093912,"['14 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Anger', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blast Cell', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Eye', 'Eye Movements', 'Eyelid structure', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Facial Muscles', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Link', 'Lip structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physical aggression', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Interaction', 'Testing', 'Violence', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aggression prevention', 'attentional bias', 'base', 'boys', 'bullying', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'gaze', 'high risk', 'high-risk adolescents', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'intervention program', 'junior high school', 'male', 'next generation', 'novel', 'peer', 'physical model', 'predictive test', 'psychological distress', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'sample fixation', 'secondary analysis', 'social', 'success', 'virtual']",NICHD,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R21,2018,232781,0.04832714424677361
"Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal responds to RFA-MH-17-612, âPilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34).â We have shown in several randomized trials that family-focused therapy (FFT) for symptomatic youth at high-risk for bipolar disorder - consisting of psychoeducation and family communication and problem solving skills training - is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in hastening symptomatic recovery. However, between 50%-60% of high-risk youth still have residual mood symptoms and functional impairment after 18 weeks of FFT. In our prior studies, two constructs have emerged as predictors of lack of response to treatment: mood instability in the child and expressed emotion (EE) in parents (i.e., frequent critical comments or hostility). In adolescents (ages 12-18) with a parent with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, we hypothesize that augmenting FFT with frequent and targeted interventions in the home setting through a Smartphone app (MyCoachConnect, or MCC) will (a) have a greater and more rapid impact than standard FFT on the targeted mechanisms of mood instability in adolescents and EE in parents, and (b) as a result, enhance symptom resolution and functioning in adolescents. To be eligible, adolescents must score high on parent-rated measures of mood instability, and have at least one parent who is high-EE by speech sample coding criteria. The MCC app will record weekly open speech samples from parents and children and daily and weekly mood ratings from adolescents. The app assessments will be fed back to the FFT clinician, who will use this information to âpushâ recommendations for mood regulation, communication, and problem-solving strategies (linked to the FFT modules) for parents and youth. In year 1, we will conduct an open trial (n=25) to determine (a) the feasibility and acceptability of FFT with mobile coaching (FFT-MCC), as given by clinicians in community settings, and (b) associations between online/speech feature proxies of the targets (mood instability and EE as measured weekly by MCC) and standard measures of the targets. In years 2 and 3 we will conduct a 75- case RCT in which families are assigned to FFT with MCC skills coaching, FFT with MCC assessments only, with no coaching; or FFT Only, without MCC. We hypothesize that FFT-MCC will be acceptable to parents, adolescents and clinicians, and more effective than FFT without MCC coaching or FFT-Only in engaging the targets of mood instability and EE and promoting improvements in adolescents' mood symptoms and quality of life over 27 weeks. The study will facilitate the translation of a technological augmentation to an evidence-based family intervention, with the goal of increasing treatment access among families with mood disorders. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a 12-session evidence- based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC âreal timeâ assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills. We hypothesize that the augmented version of FFT (FFT-MCC) will be more effective than FFT without coaching/informational alerts in altering treatment targets and in stabilizing youths' mood symptoms and quality of life.",Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders,9587465,R34MH117200,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Back', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Family', 'Family Relationship', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Hostility', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'community setting', 'effectiveness trial', 'emerging adult', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'girls', 'high risk', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'mobile application', 'mood regulation', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'psychoeducation', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'skills training', 'smartphone Application', 'standard measure', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy design', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'usability', 'volunteer']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R34,2018,195000,0.0584143554643116
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity.

"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance.

"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9224405,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2017,163452,0.038290047379223105
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 â those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 â risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9235662,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sex risk', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2017,173475,0.04359375393575959
"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for alcohol and substance use problems called motivational interviewing.",Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9265365,K02AA023814,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithmic Software', 'American', 'Applied Skills', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phonation', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disease classification', 'drinking', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'global health', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2017,141339,0.010706051402929816
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naÃ¯ve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on the effects of adolescent marijuana use on working memory, inhibitory control and corticostriatal systems.",ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project,9281715,U01DA041028,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent marijuana use', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Link', 'Logistics', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'behavioral health', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'nonhuman primate', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'time use', 'translational research program', 'trend']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2017,765100,0.2041273886855223
"SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV incidence among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) continues to rise, driven in part by substance use. MSM are increasingly using social networking sites (SNS) to find substance use and sexual partners. However, no studies currently exist that use automated, real-time data collection and analysis procedures to monitor substance use and sexual partner seeking across the range of SNS platforms used by MSM to inform intervention development. This project will build on Routine Activities Theory to conduct research using SNS interactions to aid in understanding patterns of substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. During Phase 1, focus groups of MSM (n=~8/focus group; N=24) will be used to develop a lexicon for identifying substance use and sexual partner seeking among MSM via diverse SNS platforms. These findings will guide the development of a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM; internet software that systematically searches SNS to gather data in an analyzable format) with iterative feedback from a community advisory board (CAB) and pilot testing by MSM (n=6). During Phase 2, the DCMM will gather data from 50 MSM on SNS use (e.g., frequency, intensity) substance use and HIV risk/protective behaviors (e.g., content of profiles, postings). Risk behaviors will be assessed weekly via self- report and validated with biomarkers of risk behaviors to be collected at the end of the study period using a rapid oral HIV test and drug test via nail sample. This research will result in a subsequent R34 application to develop and test a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JTAI) using machine learning technology. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) Develop and assess the utility of a culturally congruent DCMM to study the SNS use patterns, substance use and HIV risk and protective behaviors of MSM; (2) Determine associations between patterns of technology use, substance use and HIV risk behaviors among a sample of 50 MSM using a culturally congruent DCMM, self-report data collection and biomarkers for substance use and HIV; and (3) Evaluate the feasibility and the computational requirements of a just-in-time adaptive intervention to reduce substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. By devising and testing a culturally congruent DCMM to capture SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking this study lays the building blocks to developing technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) use social networking sites (SNS) to locate substance use and sexual partners, which can increase their risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. This study will devise and test a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM) to capture large quantities of SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking. This formative research has high public health significance as it can clarify the SNS partner seeking dynamics driving MSM's substance use and sexual risk behaviors to inform culturally congruent technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM.",SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior,9303328,R03DA039752,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Bisexual', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Gays', 'General Population', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Incidence', 'Informed Consent', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Law Enforcement', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'NIH Office of AIDS Research', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Sexual Partners', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'digital', 'drug testing', 'high risk population', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'oral HIV', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'protective behavior', 'public health relevance', 'reduced substance use', 'sex risk', 'sexual risk taking', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2017,154000,0.04188669479526537
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"mHealth intervention for ART adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is an adolescent medicine specialist and Director of Adolescent HIV Services at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with a research focus on using mobile technology to improve adherence and other health outcomes for adolescents at risk for and living with HIV/AIDS. The candidate proposes a career development program that will provide her with the skills and experience to become an independent investigator in the field of adolescent HIV research. In addition to didactic coursework in quantitative and qualitative research methodology and health behavior theory, the candidate's career development will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of nationally recognized advisors committed to her success. [She will form a Technology Advisory Board for mentorship and preceptorships in all aspects of mobile health (mHealth) technology, including incubation and development of technology-based health interventions, study design and analysis techniques for big data/machine learning, gamification theory, user interface/responsive design techniques, usability testing, and the application of health behavior theory to develop mHealth interventions.] Career development activities will be complemented by practical experience gained through the conduct of original research. This proposal examines key health behaviors of medication adherence and sexual risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV/AIDS, and proposes to develop a mobile phone based intervention targeted at improving these health behaviors in the real times and places youth need support. AIM 1 will describe the incidence of STI co-infections and virologic failure and report the standardized risk of these outcomes across strata of HIV+ YMSM through retrospective chart review augmented by in-depth structured interviews for further understanding of key psychosocial and behavioral factors. Using focus groups of youth at high- and low-risk, selected based on findings from AIM 1, AIM 2 will explore how HIV+ YMSM use mobile technology, and their attitudes towards various mobile phone-based tools to improve adherence and reduce sexual risk. Delphi methodology will first be used in AIM 3 to convene a panel of mHealth and adolescent health experts to establish consensus guidelines for adolescent sexual health technology-based intervention development. These results, combined with youth input from AIM 2, will serve as a guiding framework for development of a new mHealth secondary prevention intervention for HIV+ YMSM. The new mHealth intervention composed of theory-driven elements, for example, including time and location-based reminders, and individual and group-based gaming incentives will then undergo usability testing consisting of (a) a focus group for specific feedback on design and user experience and then (b) a 12-month feasibility trial where 20 youth will have the application installed and usage, satisfaction, and clinical outcome data will be collected. In line with NIMH's research priorities, this proposal sets out to develop an innovative secondary prevention strategy targeting improved medication adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed mentored award supports the career development of the candidate into an independent patient- oriented researcher focused on improving the health of adolescents living with and at-risk for HIV/AIDS. The project aims to develop a new secondary prevention intervention, using mobile phone-based technologies, for HIV+ young men who have sex with men (YMSM), targeting key behaviors of sexual risk-taking and poor medication adherence. This research is highly relevant to public health as it targets improving health outcomes of HIV+ youth and preventing new infections among YMSM who are most disproportionately affected by the HIV epidemic in the US.",mHealth intervention for ART adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM,9320848,K23MH102128,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Attitude', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Car Phone', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Services', 'Complement', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Delphi Study', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Elements', 'Epidemic', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Guidelines', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Health behavior', 'Health behavior change', 'Incentives', 'Incidence', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosyphilis', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Preceptorship', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Secondary Prevention', 'Services', 'Sexual Health', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Social Network', 'Specialist', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Viral', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'adolescent health outcomes', 'adolescent sexual health', 'antiretroviral therapy', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'co-infection', 'demographics', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'health application', 'high risk men', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medication compliance', 'men', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient oriented', 'prevent', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive tract', 'satisfaction', 'sex', 'sex risk', 'sexual risk taking', 'skills', 'success', 'technology development', 'theories', 'therapy adherence', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'usability', 'virology', 'young man', 'young men who have sex with men']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K23,2017,181281,0.039283600101963315
"Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions ABSTRACT Bullying is a preventable public health problem that can have long-lasting health, academic and social consequences. Bullying affects between 18% and 31% of adolescents and has been associated with serious negative consequences including depression, substance use, and academic failure for both the perpetrator and target. Over the past decade, bullying behavior has expanded into the digital realm and is known as cyberbullying. Cyberbullying stories have had frequent coverage by news organizations, including coverage of teens whose death from suicide was attributed to cyberbullying. Previous work illustrates the influence of news stories on individualâs attitudes and experiences. News organization coverage has been influential to readers in areas such as suicide, infectious disease outbreaks such as H1N1 flu, and tobacco use. Little is known whether and how adolescents and their families perceive or utilize news coverage of bullying or cyberbullying. News media may be an untapped resource to promote bullying prevention messages and strategies. Our long- term goal is to develop and test interventions to improve bullying prevention and intervention efforts working with media. Towards that goal, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news organization coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families. First, we will evaluate youth and parent perspectives on lay media coverage of bullying using qualitative interviews with 50 participants: 25 diverse adolescents age 15-18 years and 25 parent/guardians of these adolescents. Second, we will assess the current state of the narrative in news media coverage of bullying. We will identify a sample of 500 news articles from print/online media that cover bullying over the past 5 years and conduct content analysis using natural language processing. Using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) software we will evaluate the proportion of words that represent fear-based reporting such as alarmist words (e.g. epidemic, tragic), as well as words that represent public health-oriented messages such as prevention. We will also compare news coverage of bullying to cyberbullying. After analyzing data from these two aims, we will conduct qualitative interviews with 30 journalists. Our third aim is to synthesize these findings and identify strategies for future interventions that are feasible and acceptable to journalists. We will work with 3 consultants from the fields of communication and journalism to identify and engage journalists (n=30) in qualitative interviews. When these interconnected study aims are successfully completed, outcomes will include a comprehensive understanding of how adolescents and their parents understand and utilize news coverage of bullying, the current state of bullying and cyberbullying news coverage narrative, and perspectives of journalists on intervention approaches that are feasible and acceptable. We will utilize these findings towards novel intervention approaches, such as to leverage news coverage towards enhancing prevention of bullying. PROJECT NARRATIVE Previous studies have shown that news media coverage of health issues can change attitudes and behaviors; for example, journalistsâ approach to suicide can have significant impact on bereaved families and at-risk youth. News media can also complement public health efforts, such as through coverage of tobacco harms that have been shown to prevent smoking among adolescents. Bullying is a significant public health issues that can lead to short and long-term health effects and is frequently covered by news media; thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the current state of news coverage of bullying and cyberbullying and its impact on youth and families towards developing future interventions.",Understanding the impact of bullying news coverage on youth and families: Implications for future interventions,9390299,R21HD090221,"['Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Area', 'Attitude', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Community Health', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Epidemic', 'Exploratory/Developmental Grant', 'Failure', 'Family', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Government Agencies', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Priorities', 'Immigrant', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Influentials', 'Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Journalism', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Linguistics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Privatization', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Self Efficacy', 'Smoking', 'Suicide', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adverse outcome', 'aged', 'base', 'bullying', 'bullying prevention', 'contagion', 'cyberbullying', 'digital', 'experience', 'flu', 'health organization', 'improved', 'news', 'novel', 'perpetrators', 'prevent', 'sexual minority', 'social', 'social stigma', 'success', 'suicidal morbidity']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R21,2017,231830,-0.015894238771642366
"Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression Project Summary Adolescence is a critical time for understanding Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) because nearly half of lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders begin by age 14. Further, intergenerational risk for depression (RISK; having a parent with MDD) increases adolescent likelihood of developing MDD by three- to five-fold. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with RISK and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of RISK adolescents. The proposed research adds to an ongoing NIMH grant (U01MH108168) that compares brain function and structure between adolescents (ages 14-15) with MDD and adolescents without MDD/intergenerational risk for MDD (CON). I propose to add a new group of adolescents who are at intergenerational risk for depression (RISK) to address the following aims. First, I aim to dissociate functional and structural neural differences between risk (traits) and clinical diagnosis (state) of adolescent MDD. I will recruit and characterize 120 age- and sex-matched adolescents (ages 14-15): 40 adolescents at RISK for depression but without a personal history of MDD (RISK), 40 adolescents without RISK and no history of MDD (CON), and 40 adolescents with current MDD. I will perform (a) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), (b) structural MRI (sMRI), and (c) diffusion MRI (dMRI). Second, I aim to discover neurodevelopmental differences associated with RISK. I will re-characterize and re-scan RISK and CON adolescents two years after initial scanning. I will assess differences in functional and structural neurodevelopment between RISK and CON adolescents over this two-year period. I will also assess the extent to which RISK-associated neurodevelopmental changes in brain function and structure are related to development of depressive symptoms. Third, I aim to discover whether multimodal baseline measures predict progression of depressive symptoms in RISK adolescents. All 120 adolescents will undergo extensive clinical and neural characterization at study enrollment, and will undergo follow-up clinical examinations every six months for two years post- enrollment. I will determine whether behavioral and/or brain measures at enrollment predict the subsequent progression of depressive symptoms over this two-year period. The proposed research would be the first to: 1) dissociate functional and structural brain differences between RISK, MDD, and CON adolescents, 2) determine neurodevelopmental changes in RISK compared to CON adolescents, and 3) provide precise biological prediction of the development of depressive symptomology in at-risk adolescents. Knowledge gained from this study will provide a new understanding of the neural underpinning of both risk and developed depression in adolescence, as well as provide valuable contribution toward early prevention of MDD. Project Narrative Children of depressed parents are at increased risk for substance abuse, psychiatric disorders, and decreased social and scholastic functioning. The goal of this research is to understand adolescent neural factors associated with familial risk for depression and to characterize the neurodevelopmental path of these adolescents. We will use advanced behavioral and neuroimaging techniques to understand how developmental changes in the brain are implicated in developmental changes in depressive symptoms in adolescents at familial risk for depression.",Adolescent Brain Bases of Intergenerational Risk for Depression,9396635,F32MH114525,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Depressed mood', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Facial Expression', 'Feeling', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychopathology', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Structure', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'brain volume', 'career', 'child depression', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'depressive symptoms', 'follow-up', 'intergenerational', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social', 'trait', 'white matter']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F32,2017,56334,0.0932137279888388
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal.

"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity.

"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.            ",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9104711,R01AA018673,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Empathy', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Homicide', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'meetings', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'visual feedback', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,647176,0.005363038254433482
"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for alcohol and substance use problems called motivational interviewing.",Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9057931,K02AA023814,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithmic Software', 'American', 'Applied Skills', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disease classification', 'drinking', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'global health', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'support tools', 'technology development', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2016,138174,0.010706051402929816
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naÃ¯ve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on the effects of adolescent marijuana use on working memory, inhibitory control and corticostriatal systems.",ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project,9150541,U01DA041028,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent marijuana use', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'behavioral health', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'nonhuman primate', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'response', 'social', 'time use', 'trend']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2016,138634,0.2041273886855223
"SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV incidence among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) continues to rise, driven in part by substance use. MSM are increasingly using social networking sites (SNS) to find substance use and sexual partners. However, no studies currently exist that use automated, real-time data collection and analysis procedures to monitor substance use and sexual partner seeking across the range of SNS platforms used by MSM to inform intervention development. This project will build on Routine Activities Theory to conduct research using SNS interactions to aid in understanding patterns of substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. During Phase 1, focus groups of MSM (n=~8/focus group; N=24) will be used to develop a lexicon for identifying substance use and sexual partner seeking among MSM via diverse SNS platforms. These findings will guide the development of a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM; internet software that systematically searches SNS to gather data in an analyzable format) with iterative feedback from a community advisory board (CAB) and pilot testing by MSM (n=6). During Phase 2, the DCMM will gather data from 50 MSM on SNS use (e.g., frequency, intensity) substance use and HIV risk/protective behaviors (e.g., content of profiles, postings). Risk behaviors will be assessed weekly via self- report and validated with biomarkers of risk behaviors to be collected at the end of the study period using a rapid oral HIV test and drug test via nail sample. This research will result in a subsequent R34 application to develop and test a just-in-time adaptive intervention (JTAI) using machine learning technology. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: (1) Develop and assess the utility of a culturally congruent DCMM to study the SNS use patterns, substance use and HIV risk and protective behaviors of MSM; (2) Determine associations between patterns of technology use, substance use and HIV risk behaviors among a sample of 50 MSM using a culturally congruent DCMM, self-report data collection and biomarkers for substance use and HIV; and (3) Evaluate the feasibility and the computational requirements of a just-in-time adaptive intervention to reduce substance use and HIV risk behavior among MSM. By devising and testing a culturally congruent DCMM to capture SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking this study lays the building blocks to developing technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (hereafter MSM) use social networking sites (SNS) to locate substance use and sexual partners, which can increase their risk for HIV acquisition and transmission. This study will devise and test a culturally congruent data collection and mining module (DCMM) to capture large quantities of SNS data on MSM substance use and sexual partner seeking. This formative research has high public health significance as it can clarify the SNS partner seeking dynamics driving MSM's substance use and sexual risk behaviors to inform culturally congruent technology-based substance use and HIV prevention and treatment efforts tailored specifically for MSM.        ",SNS-based Data Mining to Understand MSM Substance use and HIV Risk Behavior,9137371,R03DA039752,"['AIDS prevention', 'Address', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Bisexual', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Gays', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Human immunodeficiency virus test', 'Incidence', 'Informed Consent', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Language', 'Law Enforcement', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Monitor', 'NIH Office of AIDS Research', 'Nail plate', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Sexual Partners', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'cost', 'data mining', 'digital', 'drug testing', 'high risk', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'men', 'men who have sex with men', 'oral HIV', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective behavior', 'public health relevance', 'reduced substance use', 'sex', 'sex risk', 'sexual risk taking', 'social media', 'social networking website', 'theories', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'web site']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R03,2016,154000,0.04188669479526537
"Automated assessment using facial coding Abstract  Transition-age youth (TAY) from ages 18-26 are especially vulnerable to substance use, misuse, and substance use disorder (SUD). This developmental period, termed the âage of instability"" and ""emerging adulthood"" includes tasks such as leaving home, entering college; identifying vocational goals; working for the first time; body and sexuality changes; coalescing with a peer group; and for some, aging out of foster care or state custody, which end at age 18. The emerging- adulthood period is prime for experimentation with substances and the development of SUD, and associated problems such as binge drinking, driving under the influence, accidents, fighting and violence, HIV, gang involvement, suicide and self-harm, and vulnerability to date-rape and other sexual assault. A major challenge for TAY is the capacity to regulate their emotions, given the hormone changes and emotional intensity of this stage of life. Indeed, substance use is often described as a short-term way to regulate emotion and there is a long-standing literature documenting the association between emotion regulation (ER) problems and SUD. The importance of ER is also grounded in the developmental literature in which ER is identified as a core skill that is critical to the successful transition to adulthood. The initial component of ER, accurate identification of emotion, is itself a major challenge, especially for people with SUD as they are often not aware of their feelings or confused about them due to the nature of the disorder as well as mental health disorders that often co-occur with SUD.  In this phase 1 proposal we describe the development of a mobile app that uses exciting new technology (automated facial coding) to help TAY better recognize their emotions in relation to SUD variables. We describe the use of front-end focus groups to provide pre-development input on the app; we detail the app features and user experience; and define the appâs technical specifications. Phase 1 also includes a pilot feasibility study of the prototype product among TAY with SUD. They will have four weeks to use the app in their natural environment, such as home, and we will conduct pre- and post-evaluation using validated instruments to characterize the sample, quantity satisfaction and feasibility, evaluate emotion- and substance-related variables, as well as explore the app metrics and its technical performance. If positive results are found this would set us up well for phase 2, which could expand the app in some really interesting directions as well as further study it in a randomized controlled trial. The app product we envision would have major public health and clinical impact. It could help improve TAYâs ability to become more aware of their emotions and understand them in relation to SUD via an exciting emotion-focused technology innovation. If the product is successful it could also be expanded to other populations. Our stellar team includes experts in SUD, TAY, clinical innovations, technology, and app development. Narrative We propose to help young adults (ages 18-26) who have substance abuse problems. Our goal is to help them learn more about their emotions in relation to their substance abuse as a way to ultimately help them reduce their substance use.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on negative reinforcement mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high SUD prevalence, and illicit drug and prescription medication misuse among adolescents.",ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project,9150522,U01DA041089,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Aversive Stimulus', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'California', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Drug usage', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Insula of Reil', 'Interview', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Minority', 'Monitor', 'Negative Reinforcements', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Quality Control', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'brain health', 'brain research', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'design', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'forest', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'modifiable risk', 'named group', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'psychological outcomes', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'stimulus processing', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'time use', 'trend']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2016,1233639,0.2282193951903804
"mHealth intervention for ART adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The candidate is an adolescent medicine specialist and Director of Adolescent HIV Services at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with a research focus on using mobile technology to improve adherence and other health outcomes for adolescents at risk for and living with HIV/AIDS. The candidate proposes a career development program that will provide her with the skills and experience to become an independent investigator in the field of adolescent HIV research. In addition to didactic coursework in quantitative and qualitative research methodology and health behavior theory, the candidate's career development will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of nationally recognized advisors committed to her success. [She will form a Technology Advisory Board for mentorship and preceptorships in all aspects of mobile health (mHealth) technology, including incubation and development of technology-based health interventions, study design and analysis techniques for big data/machine learning, gamification theory, user interface/responsive design techniques, usability testing, and the application of health behavior theory to develop mHealth interventions.] Career development activities will be complemented by practical experience gained through the conduct of original research. This proposal examines key health behaviors of medication adherence and sexual risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV/AIDS, and proposes to develop a mobile phone based intervention targeted at improving these health behaviors in the real times and places youth need support. AIM 1 will describe the incidence of STI co-infections and virologic failure and report the standardized risk of these outcomes across strata of HIV+ YMSM through retrospective chart review augmented by in-depth structured interviews for further understanding of key psychosocial and behavioral factors. Using focus groups of youth at high- and low-risk, selected based on findings from AIM 1, AIM 2 will explore how HIV+ YMSM use mobile technology, and their attitudes towards various mobile phone-based tools to improve adherence and reduce sexual risk. Delphi methodology will first be used in AIM 3 to convene a panel of mHealth and adolescent health experts to establish consensus guidelines for adolescent sexual health technology-based intervention development. These results, combined with youth input from AIM 2, will serve as a guiding framework for development of a new mHealth secondary prevention intervention for HIV+ YMSM. The new mHealth intervention composed of theory-driven elements, for example, including time and location-based reminders, and individual and group-based gaming incentives will then undergo usability testing consisting of (a) a focus group for specific feedback on design and user experience and then (b) a 12-month feasibility trial where 20 youth will have the application installed and usage, satisfaction, and clinical outcome data will be collected. In line with NIMH's research priorities, this proposal sets out to develop an innovative secondary prevention strategy targeting improved medication adherence and sexual risk reduction among HIV+ YMSM. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed mentored award supports the career development of the candidate into an independent patient- oriented researcher focused on improving the health of adolescents living with and at-risk for HIV/AIDS. The project aims to develop a new secondary prevention intervention, using mobile phone-based technologies, for HIV+ young men who have sex with men (YMSM), targeting key behaviors of sexual risk-taking and poor medication adherence.

"Preventing Drug Abuse among Hispanic Adolescents DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This resubmitted application addresses the weaknesses identified in its initial review. Prepared in response to PAS-09-001, Drug Abuse Epidemiology and Services Research in Cooperation with the Clinical and Translational Science Awards Consortium (R01), the application lays plans to develop, test, and disseminate an interactive program to delay the onset of drug use and to prevent harmful use and abuse among Hispanic youths. Study participants will come from Northern Manhattan, home to a large population of Hispanic families from Dominican, Puerto Rican, and other backgrounds. Grounded in bicultural competence and social learning theories, the prevention program will equip youths with cognitive and behavioral skills to address ethnic-specific and pan-ethnic risk and protective factors associated with drug use among Hispanic adolescents. Youths will access the program's 10 initial sessions and annual booster sessions via personal computer. Through a human simulation interaction platform, the program will employ artificial intelligence, graphic portrayals of emotional states, and a branched learning environment in which youths can acquire, try out, receive feedback on, and master new interpersonal skills. Cultural content woven into every programmatic session, together with sessions expressly dedicated to issues of acculturation, Hispanic traditions, and bicultural stress will give the program thematic coherence and enhance its attraction and value. The study design is a randomized clinical trial. Enrolled 11-, 12-, and 13-year-old youths will complete baseline measures, intervention-arm youths will receive the initial prevention program, and all youths will complete post-intervention and 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-up measures. Intervention-arm youths will additionally receive pairs of booster sessions after they complete 12- and 24-month follow-up measurements. Hypothesis testing analyses will examine 30-day drug use rates between arms and across follow-up measurement occasions. In addition, we will analyze intervention effects on mediator variables associated with drug use risk and protective factors. We also will assess the extent to which changes on mediator variables explain drug use differences. And, we will examine gender differences, and, to the extent possible, immigration status and ethnic background differences in study outcomes. At the conclusion of the trial, and assuming that longitudinal findings support the tested prevention approach, we will revise the program to increase its appeal for Hispanic youth across America, and we will disseminate the revised program through a variety of online resources. Throughout, we will monitor program dissemination. This study will longitudinally test a computerized drug abuse prevention program for Hispanic adolescents. The culturally-tailored prevention program aims to strengthen and sustain protective factors while equipping youths with the necessary information and skills to reduce risk factors associated with cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, and other harmful drug use.",Preventing Drug Abuse among Hispanic Adolescents,9114094,R01DA031477,"['13 year old', '18 year old', 'Acculturation', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohols', 'Americas', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Award', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'CD-ROM', 'Child', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Dominican', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Services Research', 'Hispanics', 'Home environment', 'Household', 'Human', 'Immigration', 'Institutes', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Personal Computers', 'Play', 'Prevention approach', 'Prevention program', 'Puerto Rican', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Speed', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent drug use', 'arm', 'base', 'computerized', 'drug abuse prevention', 'educational atmosphere', 'follow-up', 'gender difference', 'high risk', 'intervention effect', 'intervention program', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'post intervention', 'prevent', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'social cognitive theory', 'social networking website', 'theories', 'trend']",NIDA,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2016,654688,0.053223463075780325

"Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION: Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. What is the quality of these interventions? In truth, we have no idea. To evaluate the quality of behavioral interventions such as psychotherapy researchers rely on human evaluation through behavioral coding, which is a major impediment to scaling up and sustaining high-quality interventions for alcohol abuse in large-scale implementation. Human evaluation of behavioral interventions is a rate-limiting factor, and a technological solution is needed that incorporates human expertise but does not rely on human judgment as the evaluation tool.  The current K02 career development proposal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity for alcohol and substance use disorders. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from engineering and statistical text- mining experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. The work is currently supported by an R01 (AA018673) methods development grant and an R34 (DA034860) feasibility trial. Career development activities will encompass additional training, experience, and collaboration in three areas: 1) technical tools and methods (speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), 2) clinical process and change mechanisms of MI, and 3) large-scale implementation. A team of senior mentors, who are nationally and internationally recognized experts in each of the three core areas, will oversee the career development activities. These activities have been designed to deepen knowledge in key topics (course work, directed reading), develop applied skills (hands-on work with speech signal processing, statistical text-mining, and machine learning), advance integration of technology with clinical process (co- reviewing MI sessions from the view of computational tools and MI clinical theory), and prepare for large-scale implementation of automated MI fidelity coding and feedback (engage key stakeholders in large healthcare systems via the mental health research network). Research conducted during the K02 will: a) systematically explore how much and which portion(s) of MI sessions are needed for accurate fidelity assessment; b) conduct innovative process research on how tone and prosody of spoken language moderate the association of client change talk with patient outcome; and, c) incorporate cutting-edge visual design in developing an automated fidelity feedback report for MI therapists.  This career development award will support, enhance, and move forward research developing automated clinical support tools to provide rapid feedback to MI therapists. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of behavioral interventions for all Americans struggling with alcohol problems.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: How do we know whether a psychotherapy session is a `good' psychotherapy session? Presently, we rely on human judgment in a process called behavioral coding to decide what is good or high-quality, but this greatly limits our ability to evaluate psychotherapy in the real world, as human judgment and coding is expensive and time-consuming. The current career development proposal supports ongoing technology development focused on using algorithms and software, instead of human judgment, to evaluate a particular type of psychotherapy for alcohol and substance use problems called motivational interviewing.            ",Using Technology to Scale Up the Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,8863672,K02AA023814,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithmic Software', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Cellular Phone', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Discipline', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Empathy', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Health Services', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Property', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Services', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Software Tools', 'Solutions', 'Speech', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Technology Assessment', 'Telephone', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Work', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disease classification', 'drinking', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'global health', 'high risk', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'method development', 'mortality', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'scale up', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'technology development', 'text searching', 'theories', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K02,2015,142637,0.010706051402929816
"ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period that is associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying predictors of substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as substance-related decrements incurred during ongoing maturation could have long- lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. In response to RFA- DA-15-015, this application proposes the University of Pittsburgh Research Project Site component [12/13] of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD)-USA consortium to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral effects of substance on children and adolescents. In Pittsburgh, a representative community sample of 550 9-10 year old substance-naÃ¯ve children will be recruited (total ABCD- USA n=11,111 from 11 total sites) and will undergo a baseline assessment and two to three follow-ups over a five year period. At each assessment period, participants will undergo state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, and extensive assessment of substance use patterns and mental health functioning. The brain, behavioral, psychological, social, genetic, and environmental data collected during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects o substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. Elements Unique to This Site: In addition, ABCD-USA Pittsburgh will provide a unique focus determining how the cognitive dimensions of working memory and inhibitory control and the maturation of corticostriatal systems can inform our understanding of the risks for and effects of early adolescent marijuana use. Working memory and inhibitory control improve during adolescence in parallel with maturation of underlying corticostriatal neurocircuitry. An understanding of these areas of adolescent brain and cognitive development provide critical information in models determining vulnerabilities for and consequences of marijuana and other substance use. In Y03, Pittsburgh will focus on analyses examining working memory and inhibitory control phenotypes and neurodevelopmental characteristics prior to substance use. In Y04-Y05, these neurocognitive characteristics will be examined as risks for early adolescent marijuana use trajectories and, in Y10, accelerated adolescent marijuana use trajectories. Machine Learning will be applied to integrating cognitive and neuroimaging features to characterize a model of risks for early adolescent marijuana use.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 12/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 550 youth age 9-10 at project entry. In addition to contributions to the overall consortium, our U01 will specifically focus on the effects of adolescent marijuana use on working memory, inhibitory control and corticostriatal systems.        ",ABCD-USA Consortium:Research Project,9052904,U01DA041028,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent marijuana use', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Institutes', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Site', 'Social Functioning', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Youth', 'adolescent substance use', 'behavioral health', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'cognitive testing', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'emerging adult', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'misuse of prescription only drugs', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'nonhuman primate', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'psychological outcomes', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'time use', 'trend']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,U01,2015,128696,0.2041273886855223
"ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescence is a critical neurodevelopmental period associated with dramatic increases in rates of substance use. Identifying the pathways to substance use and its effects on child and adolescent development is critically important, as the effects of substance use during ongoing maturation likely have long-lasting effects on brain functioning and behavioral, health, and psychological outcomes. This Research Project Site application from the University of California, San Diego and Laureate Institute for Brain Research is in response to RFA-DA-15-015 as part of the ABCD-USA Consortium (5/13), to prospectively determine the neurodevelopmental and behavioral predictors and consequences of substance use on children and adolescents. A representative community sample of 1086 9-10 year olds enriched for high- risk characteristics will be recruited, contributing to the sample f 11,111 to be collected from 11 hubs across the ABCD- USA Consortium. All participants will undergo a comprehensive baseline assessment, including state-of-the-art brain imaging, comprehensive neuropsychological testing, bioassays, mobile monitoring and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning every 2 years. Interim annual interviews and quarterly web-based assessments will provide refined temporal resolution of behaviors, development, and life events with minimal participant burden. These Consortium-wide data obtained during the course of this project will elucidate: 1) the effects of substance use patterns on the adolescent brain; 2) the effects of substance use on behavioral and health outcomes; 3) the bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and substance use patterns; 4) the effects of individual genetic, behavioral, neurobiological, and environmental differences on risk profiles and substance use outcomes; and 5) the ""gateway interactions"" between use of different substances. This hub's Research Project focuses on mechanisms of substance use disorder, special populations with high use prevalence, and the use of drugs other than marijuana. (1) We will determine whether individual differences in neural processing of antireward (i.e., negative reinforcement mechanisms) in amygdala, insula, and anterior cingulate are associated with increased negative emotionality and pain, predict initiation of use and problem use, and are in turn further dysregulated by substance use. (2) We will determine whether protective environment factors and ethnic identification in minority youth are linked to healthier antireward processing and better substance use outcomes. (3) We will determine whether antireward neural processing predicts increased use of illicit drugs other than MJ including misuse of prescription drugs, if such use predicts subsequent exaggerated antireward processing, and if gateway interactions exist between substances. Finally, we will use machine learning approaches to develop a youth-specific risk calculator that will enable us to identify individually- based modifiable risk factor, providing brain-based targets of future novel prevention and intervention approaches.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our 5/13 ABCD-USA Consortium: Research Project will recruit and assess 1086 youth age 9-10 at project entry.

The candidate proposes a career development program that will provide her with the skills and experience to become an independent investigator in the field of adolescent HIV research. In addition to didactic coursework in quantitative and qualitative research methodology and health behavior theory, the candidate's career development will be guided by a multidisciplinary team of nationally recognized advisors committed to her success. [She will form a Technology Advisory Board for mentorship and preceptorships in all aspects of mobile health (mHealth) technology, including incubation and development of technology-based health interventions, study design and analysis techniques for big data/machine learning, gamification theory, user interface/responsive design techniques, usability testing, and the application of health behavior theory to develop mHealth interventions.] Career development activities will be complemented by practical experience gained through the conduct of original research. This proposal examines key health behaviors of medication adherence and sexual risk among young men who have sex with men (YMSM) living with HIV/AIDS, and proposes to develop a mobile phone based intervention targeted at improving these health behaviors in the real times and places youth need support. AIM 1 will describe the incidence of STI co-infections and virologic failure and report the standardized risk of these outcomes across strata of HIV+ YMSM through retrospective chart review augmented by in-depth structured interviews for further understanding of key psychosocial and behavioral factors. Using focus groups of youth at high- and low-risk, selected based on findings from AIM 1, AIM 2 will explore how HIV+ YMSM use mobile technology, and their attitudes towards various mobile phone-based tools to improve adherence and reduce sexual risk. Delphi methodology will first be used in AIM 3 to convene a panel of mHealth and adolescent health experts to establish consensus guidelines for adolescent sexual health technology-based intervention development. These results, combined with youth input from AIM 2, will serve as a guiding framework for development of a new mHealth secondary prevention intervention for HIV+ YMSM. The new mHealth intervention composed of theory-driven elements, for example, including time and location-based reminders, and individual and group-based gaming incentives will then undergo usability testing consisting of (a) a focus group for specific feedback on design and user experience and then (b) a 12-month feasibility trial where 20 youth will have the application installed and usage, satisfaction, and clinical outcome data will be collected.

"Preventing Drug Abuse among Hispanic Adolescents DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This resubmitted application addresses the weaknesses identified in its initial review. Prepared in response to PAS-09-001, Drug Abuse Epidemiology and Services Research in Cooperation with the Clinical and Translational Science Awards Consortium (R01), the application lays plans to develop, test, and disseminate an interactive program to delay the onset of drug use and to prevent harmful use and abuse among Hispanic youths. Study participants will come from Northern Manhattan, home to a large population of Hispanic families from Dominican, Puerto Rican, and other backgrounds. Grounded in bicultural competence and social learning theories, the prevention program will equip youths with cognitive and behavioral skills to address ethnic-specific and pan-ethnic risk and protective factors associated with drug use among Hispanic adolescents. Youths will access the program's 10 initial sessions and annual booster sessions via personal computer. Through a human simulation interaction platform, the program will employ artificial intelligence, graphic portrayals of emotional states, and a branched learning environment in which youths can acquire, try out, receive feedback on, and master new interpersonal skills. Cultural content woven into every programmatic session, together with sessions expressly dedicated to issues of acculturation, Hispanic traditions, and bicultural stress will give the program thematic coherence and enhance its attraction and value. The study design is a randomized clinical trial. Enrolled 11-, 12-, and 13-year-old youths will complete baseline measures, intervention-arm youths will receive the initial prevention program, and all youths will complete post-intervention and 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-up measures. Intervention-arm youths will additionally receive pairs of booster sessions after they complete 12- and 24-month follow-up measurements. Hypothesis testing analyses will examine 30-day drug use rates between arms and across follow-up measurement occasions. In addition, we will analyze intervention effects on mediator variables associated with drug use risk and protective factors. We also will assess the extent to which changes on mediator variables explain drug use differences. And, we will examine gender differences, and, to the extent possible, immigration status and ethnic background differences in study outcomes. At the conclusion of the trial, and assuming that longitudinal findings support the tested prevention approach, we will revise the program to increase its appeal for Hispanic youth across America, and we will disseminate the revised program through a variety of online resources. Throughout, we will monitor program dissemination. This study will longitudinally test a computerized drug abuse prevention program for Hispanic adolescents.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis Center ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ABCD-USA Consortium proposes a study designed to permit the scientific community to answer important questions about the effects of substance use (SU) patterns on behavioral and brain development of adolescents. We have assembled a team of investigators with unparalleled research experience with children and adolescents, and specific expertise in adolescent SU, child and adolescent development, developmental psychopathology, longitudinal multi-site imaging, developmental neuroimaging, developmental cognitive neuroscience, genetics and imaging genetics, bioassays, epidemiology, survey research, bioinformatics, and mobile assessment technologies. We propose a comprehensive, nationwide study to be conducted at 21 sites organized into 11 hubs (over 89 million Americans, 29% of the US population, live within 50 miles of our geographically spread sites), that, uniquely, can provide a nationally representative sample and a large twin sample that together can help distinguish environmental, sociocultural, and genetic factors relevant to SU. We ensure cohesion and standardization by employing a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD-USA Data Analysis and Informatics Center (DAIC), which will: establish a harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; establish rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay-derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state- of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; and implement infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw- and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows, and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The ABCD-USA Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,111 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development.

"Preventing Drug Abuse among Hispanic Adolescents    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This resubmitted application addresses the weaknesses identified in its initial review. Prepared in response to PAS-09-001, Drug Abuse Epidemiology and Services Research in Cooperation with the Clinical and Translational Science Awards Consortium (R01), the application lays plans to develop, test, and disseminate an interactive program to delay the onset of drug use and to prevent harmful use and abuse among Hispanic youths. Study participants will come from Northern Manhattan, home to a large population of Hispanic families from Dominican, Puerto Rican, and other backgrounds. Grounded in bicultural competence and social learning theories, the prevention program will equip youths with cognitive and behavioral skills to address ethnic-specific and pan-ethnic risk and protective factors associated with drug use among Hispanic adolescents. Youths will access the program's 10 initial sessions and annual booster sessions via personal computer. Through a human simulation interaction platform, the program will employ artificial intelligence, graphic portrayals of emotional states, and a branched learning environment in which youths can acquire, try out, receive feedback on, and master new interpersonal skills. Cultural content woven into every programmatic session, together with sessions expressly dedicated to issues of acculturation, Hispanic traditions, and bicultural stress will give the program thematic coherence and enhance its attraction and value. The study design is a randomized clinical trial. Enrolled 11-, 12-, and 13-year-old youths will complete baseline measures, intervention-arm youths will receive the initial prevention program, and all youths will complete post-intervention and 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-up measures. Intervention-arm youths will additionally receive pairs of booster sessions after they complete 12- and 24-month follow-up measurements. Hypothesis testing analyses will examine 30-day drug use rates between arms and across follow-up measurement occasions. In addition, we will analyze intervention effects on mediator variables associated with drug use risk and protective factors. We also will assess the extent to which changes on mediator variables explain drug use differences. And, we will examine gender differences, and, to the extent possible, immigration status and ethnic background differences in study outcomes. At the conclusion of the trial, and assuming that longitudinal findings support the tested prevention approach, we will revise the program to increase its appeal for Hispanic youth across America, and we will disseminate the revised program through a variety of online resources.

"Neural Network Predictors of Treatment Outcome Among Adolescent Assault Victims     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for a NIMH Exploratory/Developmental Grant Award (R21) seeks to identify neural functional connectivity patterns associated with response to Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) among female adolescent assault victims. Adolescent assault exposure is a potent risk factor for persistent psychopathology, most notably PTSD. TF-CBT is the only treatment for adolescent PTSD victims with strong empirical support, yet response to TF-CBT is variable and many victims continue to exhibit clinically significant symptoms following treatment. The overall goal of this proposal is to use computational neuroscience tools to predict and understand treatment response among this vulnerable population. Based on human neuroimaging studies demonstrating altered activity and connectivity within neural networks mediating emotion reactivity and emotion regulation among PTSD victims, we hypothesize that patterns of functional connectivity within these neural networks can be used to predict and understand response to TF-CBT among adolescent assault victims. 45 adolescent assault victims aged 11-16 will be provided with a 12-week course of TF-CBT. Participants will undergo fMRI scanning while engaged in emotion reactivity and emotion regulation tasks before and after treatment. A combination of graph theory analyses and support vector classification and regression will be used to identify pre-treatment patterns of functional connectivity that predict subsequent response to TF-CBT (Aim 1). Graph theory analyses will similarly be used to identify changes in network organization from pre-to-post-treatment associated with successful (Aim 2) and unsuccessful (Aim 3) treatment response. This analytic approach to the clinical problem of understanding the variable response to TF-CBT will foster concrete algorithms to be used by a clinician to predict a child's treatment response, which is the first step towards personalizing treatments for this vulnerable population. Further, this analytic approach will identify the essential neural mechanism mediating treatment response and provide targets for the development of novel treatment components. This application proposes a novel approach towards understanding treatment response among a vulnerable adolescent population and will hopefully facilitate the development of more consistent interventions to ameliorate the high cost associated with adolescent assault exposure.          This proposal investigates neural network predictors of treatment outcome among assaulted adolescent girls.

"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving  Project Summary Abstract This proposal aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effets of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding). The developmental and experimental elements of this proposal will lead to new avenues for treatment that would be readily generalizable to other forms of drug addiction besides nicotine, and potentially impacting on the outcomes of the substantial numbers of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment.

"Substance Abuse Continuing Care through Mobile Assessment and Messaging. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase I SBIR application entitled ""Substance Abuse Continuing Care through Mobile Assessment and Messaging"" is designed to create a low cost, continuous care decision support text messaging intervention to increase treatment adherence, decrease drop-out and prevent the recurrence of problem drug use during and following professionally facilitated addiction treatment. Based on the high drop-out rates during treatment and relapse rates following treatment, it has been proposed that addiction should be treated similarly to other chronic illnesses that require long-term intensive monitoring and care. Recent research on adaptive phone-based continuing care interventions supports the use of a chronic care addictions treatment model both for those attempting to change illicit substance abuse and society as a whole. There is an emerging literature on the use of text messaging and ecological momentary assessment through mobile phones for low cost automated disease management of chronic illnesses like asthma and diabetes. Text messaging is ideally suited to addiction continuous care because the mobile phone is capable of providing low cost adaptive monitoring and feedback wherever and whenever relapse is most likely to occur. The proposed study is designed to develop the content, structure, programming and user interface of an automated interactive drug treatment continuous care text messaging intervention that can be modulated by the severity of symptoms during and following substance abuse treatment. The intervention will include web-based assessment, ecological momentary assessment (EMA), adaptive supportive messaging based on assessment results and counselor/social network alerts. The intervention is designed to both retain persons in treatment and help them sustain long-term change following treatment. We will obtain outside feedback and review of the preliminary intervention through focus groups with a heterogeneous group of clients enrolled in substance abuse treatment. Thought leaders with expertise in addiction, continuous care, text messaging and ecological momentary assessment will help develop the core content and features of the intervention. Specific content and programming benchmarks for success will determine Phase II feasibility. If successful this messaging program has the potential to significantly improve outcomes for the 2.2 million chronic illicit substance users who seek treatment each year without the financial burden and/or time commitment needed to implement traditional counselor based continuing care interventions. Additionally, the program can be used by clients of private addiction specialists and could be adapted to reach substance abusers in earlier stages of change as a stepped care intervention. Despite the emerging literature on the importance and effectiveness of continuing care  interventions for drug abuse, few treatment programs implement these strategies into care  due to lack of resources and financial incentive. We propose to create a low cost adaptive  continuing care text messaging support and monitoring program through the mobile phone  to help reduce drug abuse treatment drop-out and relapse among illicit drug users  attempting to change. If study aims are achieved, the proposed intervention could be easily  disseminated to providers, improve long-term psychosocial and health outcomes for  substance users and reduce overall healthcare costs related to substance abuse.",Substance Abuse Continuing Care through Mobile Assessment and Messaging.,7998538,R43DA029359,"['Abstinence', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Asthma', 'Back', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Care', 'Chronic Disease', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease Management', 'Drops', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Drug user', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Expenditure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Personnel', 'Health behavior', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Long-Term Care', 'Marketing', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Principal Investigator', 'Professional counselor', 'Provider', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Smoking', 'Social Network', 'Societies', 'Specialist', 'Staging', 'Stimulus Generalization', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'addiction', 'base', 'cost', 'data management', 'design', 'disorder later incidence prevention', 'financial incentive', 'improved', 'meetings', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychosocial', 'response', 'substance abuse treatment', 'substance abuser', 'success', 'treatment adherence', 'treatment program', 'volunteer']",NIDA,"MOBILE HEALTH INTERVENTIONS, LLC",R43,2010,119348,0.052572573136384984
"Development and Use of rtfMRI for Self-control of Nicotine Craving    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application aims to study the application of functional magnetic resonance imaging in real time (rtfMRI) as an operant training feedback mechanism for treating substance use disorders. Recent data suggest that individuals can reduce activity in some brain regions (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, anterior insula, auditory cortex when they are presented with information about activation in that brain region. Experimental and clinical pain have been reduced with rtfMRI signal feedback from the rostral anterior cingulate in a manner proportional to reductions in the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal from that region. These regions overlap with those involved in the effects of substances of abuse and the development of substance use disorders (SUDs). The initial information opens the possibility of applying neurofeedback to improve treatment outcomes in patient samples. The present application seeks to expand the investigation of these processes and validate their applicability to substance dependent volunteers. In initial studies we will examine the capacity of nicotine dependent volunteers to reduce their craving for cigarettes. This substance was selected for its high retention rates and prevalence and public health burden in the general population, but it is expected that future studies would explore other forms of addiction (e.g. cocaine, opiates). Our multidisciplinary team proposes to advance current knowledge in this area by: (1) using data not from a single brain region, but from networks involved in nicotine craving and dependence, thereby accounting for inter- individual differences in brain regional activation patterns during nicotine craving; (2) developing a quantifiable method by using arterial spin labeling (ASL); and (3) determining the influence of individual expectations on these processes (e.g. assessing the degree to which these effects are attributable to placebo-related responding). The developmental and experimental elements of this application will lead to new avenues for treatment that would be readily generalizable to other forms of drug addiction besides nicotine, and potentially impacting on the outcomes of the substantial numbers of individuals seeking substance abuse treatment.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of new methodology for the treatment of patients with substance use disorders would represent a significant advance in the therapeutics of these disorders.

"Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients PROJECT SUMMARY  The rate of substance use-related hospital visits in the US continues to increase, and now outpaces visits for heart disease and respiratory failure. The prevalence of substance misuse (nonmedical use of opioids and/or benzodiazepines, illicit drugs, and/or alcohol) in hospitalized patients is estimated to be 15%-25% and far exceeds the prevalence in the general population. With over 35 million hospitalized patients per year, tens of millions of patients are not screened for substance misuse during their stay. Despite the recommendation for self-report questionnaires (single-question universal screens, Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test [AUDIT], Drug Abuse Screening Tool [DAST]), screening rates remains low in hospitals. Current screening methods are resource-intensive, so a comprehensive and automated approach to substance misuse screening that will augment current clinical workflow would therefore be of great utility.  In the advent of Meaningful Use in the electronic health record (EHR), efficiency for substance misuse detection may be improved by leveraging data collected during usual care. Documentation of substance use is common and occurs in 97% of provider admission notes, but their free text format renders them difficult to mine and analyze. Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning are subfields of artificial intelligence (AI) that provide a solution to analyze text data in the EHR to identify substance misuse. Modern NLP has fused with machine learning, another sub-field of AI focused on learning from data. In particular, the most powerful NLP methods rely on supervised learning, a type of machine learning that takes advantage of current reference standards to make predictions about unseen cases  In our earlier version of an NLP and machine learning tool, our opioid and alcohol misuse classifiers successfully used data from clinical notes collected in the first 24 hours of hospital admission to reach a sensitivity and specificity above 75% for detecting alcohol or opioid misuse. We will improve the performance of our baseline, individual NLP single-substance classifiers for alcohol and opioid misuse by implementing multi-label and multi-task machine learning methods. These methods will take advantage of information shared across different types of substance misuse and better capture the state of a patient within a single model. The resulting classifier will be capable of jointly inferring all types of substance misuse (alcohol misuse, opioid misuse, and non-opioid illicit misuse) including polysubstance use, and cater to each individual patientâs substance use treatment needs.  We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 35,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. The top performing classifier will then be tested prospectively to: (1) externally validate its screening performance in a hospital without established screening; and (2) test its effectiveness against usual care at a hospital with questionnaire-based substance misuse screening. We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal screening in hospitalized patients and guiding interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of the substance misuse classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems. We will rigorously develop and test substance misuse classifier retrospectively and then examine its performance prospectively in both a naÃ¯ve and mature screening program. This will serve as the first step towards a comprehensive universal screener that leverages available data in the EHR.",Data Driven Strategies for Substance Misuse Identification in Hospitalized Patients,10026785,R01DA051464,"['Admission activity', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Benzodiazepines', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Felis catus', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health Care Sector', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Interruption', 'Intervention', 'Interviewer', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Recommendation', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Screening procedure', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Social Work', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Substance Abuse Detection', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'addiction', 'alcohol misuse', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'comparison intervention', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interoperability', 'machine learning method', 'multitask', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'routine care', 'screening', 'screening program', 'substance misuse', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment as usual', 'trend', 'unstructured data']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,663889,0.0538362723637759
"NorthStar Node of the Clinical Trials Network Since joining the NIDA National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) in 2015, the NorthStar Node has made significant contributions to the objectives and priorities of the CTN. The NorthStar Node and its investigators have led or co-led five CTN protocols, served as a research site for seven CTN studies, co- chaired the CTN Steering Committee and the Data Science Work Group, served on the Research Development Committee, and contributed to several special interest groups. The NorthStar Node's research portfolio includes traditional randomized controlled trials (CTN-0068), pragmatic comparative effectiveness research (CTN-0098A and CTN-0099), implementation science (CTN-0074, CTN-0098B, and CTN-0099), community-based participatory research (CTN-0096), data science (CTN-0076 and CTN-0087), and health services research (CTN-0070). In this application, the NorthStar Node has seven guiding objectives (POLARIS): 1) generating evidence that informs Policy and clinical guidelines; 2) evaluating models addressing co-Occurring SUD and medical and psychiatric conditions; 3) using principals of a Learning health system to conduct pragmatic trials; 4) using Artificial intelligence and other data sciences approaches to enhance SUD research and care; 5) Reaching understudied populations to ensure SUD research is relevant to diverse populations; 6) using Implementation science to test the integration of evidence-based SUD practices into general medical settings; and 7) testing innovative Strategies for SUD treatment. Potential studies to meet these objectives include 1) a novel therapeutic intervention for methamphetamine use disorder; 2) development of machine learning algorithms in the electronic health record to target substance use screening and enhance substance use disorder diagnoses; 3) precision/personalized medicine studies using population pharmacokinetics to better define and refine medication dosing strategies that improve treatment outcome; and 4) testing collaborative care models to address co-occurring chronic medical illnesses in specialty addiction treatment settings. Our expertise spans multi-site clinical trials, implementation science, community-based participatory research, EHR-based interventions, machine learning and natural language processing, and health services research. In addition to community partners that include urban and rural integrated health systems, federally qualified health centers serving underrepresented minorities, specialty addiction treatment programs, and pediatric and adolescent health clinics, the NorthStar Node brings affiliated research and dissemination networks into the CTN, including CTSA, SIREN, PCORNet, JCOIN, HOPE, the Network Coordinating Office of the Addiction Technology Transfer Centers, a learning health system training program (K12), three NIDA training programs (T32), and fellowship programs in addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry.

"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network PROJECT SUMMARY  Individuals with substance use disorders are disproportionately experiencing homelessness, poverty, and chronic medical conditions (diabetes and hypertension), which are emerging risk factors for contracting SARS-CoV-2 (official name for the virus that causes COVID-19). Different types of substance use have been associated with development of respiratory infections and progression to severe respiratory failure, also known as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). However, complex syndromes like ARDS and behavioral conditions like substance misuse are difficult to identify from the electronic health record. Clinical notes and radiology reports provide a rich source of information that may be used to identify cases of substance misuse and ARDS. This information is routinely recorded during hospital care, and automated, data-driven solutions with natural language processing (NLP) can extract semantics and important risk factors from the unstructured data of clinical notes. The computational methods of NLP derive meaning from clinical notes, from which machine learning can predict risk factors for patients leaving AMA or progressing to respiratory failure. Our team developed tools with >80% sensitivity/specificity to identify individual types of substance misuse using NLP with machine learning (ML). Our single-center models delineated risk factors embedded in the notes (e.g., mental health conditions, socioeconomic indicators). Further, we have developed and externally validated a machine learning tool to identify cases of ARDS with high accuracy for early treatment. We aim to expand this work by pooling data across health systems and build a generalizable and comprehensive classifier that captures multiple types of substance misuse for use in risk stratification and prognostication during the COVID pandemic.  We hypothesize that a single-model NLP substance misuse classifier will provide a standardized, interoperable, and accurate approach for universal analysis of hospitalized patients, and that such information can be used to identify those at risk for disrupted care and those at risk for respiratory failure. We aim to train and test our substance misuse classifiers at Rush in a retrospective dataset of over 60,000 hospitalizations that have been manually screened with the universal screen, AUDIT, and DAST. This Administrative Supplement will allow us to examine the correlations between substances of misuse and risk for COVID-19 as well as development of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) in the context of these phenomena. PROJECT NARRATIVE We anticipate that the research proposed will provide novel and critically important tools in artificial intelligence for the detection of substance misuse and COVID-19 from the electronic health record (EHR). Development and validation of a digital classifier would enable a standardized approach to perform screening on all patient encounters on a daily basis in health systems. We will rigorously develop and test the classifier retrospectively on an existing dataset of 60,000 patients. This will serve as the first step towards a comprehensive universal screener that leverages available data in the EHR.",Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network,10173503,UG1DA049467,"['2019-nCoV', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Administrative Supplement', 'Adult', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consumption', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disasters', 'Drug abuse', 'Drug usage', 'Early treatment', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Equipment', 'Felis catus', 'General Population', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Status', 'Health system', 'Heart Diseases', 'Home environment', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hurricane', 'Hypertension', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Poverty', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Semantics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Social support', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Sterility', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'behavioral health', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'digital', 'drug market', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'interoperability', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana use', 'mortality risk', 'non-opioid analgesic', 'novel', 'opioid misuse', 'overdose death', 'pandemic disease', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'screening', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'social stigma', 'socioeconomics', 'substance misuse', 'success', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'unstructured data']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,UG1,2020,139752,0.042114963636222386
"Social Media Use and Mechanisms of Suicide Risk in Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract Suicide rates have nearly doubled among adolescent girls over the past decade. During this same time period, social media sites (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook) have become ubiquitous, with nearly 97% of youth now using social media. Social media offers both risks and benefits for adolescent development. However, there is likely a vulnerable subset of youth for whom social media use influences suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs). The primary goal of this study is to examine how and for whom social media use contributes risk for STBs, so that we may better identify and intervene with youth most at risk. A multi-method approach, integrating computational psychiatry and experimental techniques, will be used to investigate the specific mechanisms by which social media use affects STBs. Data will be collected from both an existing dataset (n ~ 2,000) and a recruited sample (n = 90 adolescent females, ages 14-17, with lifetime history of STBs). To identify specific, directly observable social media experiences that heighten risk for STBs, digital trace data (i.e., social media content and meta-data) will be collected directly from adolescentsâ social media pages and analyzed using machine learning techniques. In addition, an innovative laboratory paradigm with eye- tracking/pupillometry will be used to examine cognitive and affective responses to social media use that increase vulnerability to STBs. Participant STBs will be assessed at baseline, 3-month-, and 6-month follow ups. The aims of the study are well-aligned with the candidateâs long-term career goal of becoming an independent investigator of adolescent social media use and mental health. To purse this research agenda going forward, the candidate proposes training in four key areas: (1) machine learning methods for analyzing digital trace data, (2) experimental eye tracking/pupillometry paradigms, (3) mechanism-based translational research in adolescent suicide risk, and (4) professional development, with an emphasis on training in effective interdisciplinary collaboration and the ethics of social media research. A team of mentors and consultants from multiple disciplines will facilitate the candidateâs training, including experts in youth suicide risk, machine learning and natural language processing, and experimental peer interaction paradigms. The diverse resources available at Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital will ensure successful completion of the project and foster the development of the candidateâs research program. The proposed study has the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of the role of social media in adolescent suicide risk. Completion of the proposed research and training goals will uniquely position the candidate to become a leader in the field of adolescent social media use. Project Narrative Nearly all adolescents use social media sites, yet for a vulnerable subset of teens, social media use may increase risk for suicide. Given rising suicide rates among adolescent girls in recent years, it is critical to examine the reasons why social media use may be related to suicidal thoughts and attempts. Findings of this study will have the potential to inform future suicide intervention and prevention efforts that address the unique needs of adolescents in the digital age.",Social Media Use and Mechanisms of Suicide Risk in Adolescents,9951503,K23MH122669,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Exhibits', 'Eye', 'Facebook', 'Feedback', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Female Adolescents', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Linguistics', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Psychiatry', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rhode Island', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self Disclosure', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Environment', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Twitter', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'digital', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gaze', 'girls', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning method', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'social media', 'social norm', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'therapy development', 'visual tracking', 'web interface']",NIMH,RHODE ISLAND HOSPITAL,K23,2020,195616,-0.05470054845457078
"Great Lakes Node of the Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract In alignment with RFA-DA-19-008, this application seeks to establish the Great Lakes Node (GLN) of the NIDA-supported Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network (CTN). This node will draw on an experienced set of investigators who have active collaborations and represent all of the major academic medical centers in the Greater Chicago and Wisconsin areas. The node will serve as a vital Midwestern hub for the CTN and will expand on the success of the CTN approach. In addition, the GLN will bring substantial experience in adolescent/young adult research, seniors/aging research, digital & mobile technologies, opioid misuse, collaborative care/population health, telehealth, and electronic health record and systems-driven interventions and research methodologies. The GLN will support engagement with CTN protocols and also add the following: Aim 1: GLN will identify and recommend substance misuse research and intervention protocols focused on systems-based practice using hospital-based screening, collaborative care, and population approaches. Aim 2: We will establish a digital and computation health core that will leverage our expertise in these domains and serve as a conduit for studies in mHealth, eHealth, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and telehealth interventions. Aim 3: Our node will bring substantial expertise with youth/adolescent health and seniors/aging that will enable us to recommend studies to the CTN that examine the genesis of substance misuse and the potential for prevention strategies to mitigate these life-course pathways. Aim 4: In alignment with our teamâs expertise, we plan to support work on substance and opioid misuse that focuses on health disparities including socioeconomic, geographic, sexual orientation, and gender identity. Aim 5: Leveraging our experience in professional education and practice-based learning, our node will rigorously test the impact of professional education on opioid and substance treatment. We have built on the ECHO model to develop methods to conduct high-quality distance education and supported training that are currently being trialed in Illinois with plans to expand these programs nationally. Aim 6: GLN will expand the pipeline of early investigators interested in substance misuse research. We will align this part of our program with our very successful CTSA-supported programs and build specific subprogramming that supports addiction and substance misuse research, training, and mentorship.

"SUDCare: A smart mobile tool to support substance use screening and follow-up care PROJECT SUMMARY Substance use disorder (SUD) is a significant public health challenge that costs the US over $740 billion annually and lacks the current workforce to address it. Our proposed innovation, SUDCare, is a novel and intelligent mobile application that will be designed to address the pressing needs of primary care patients who have inadequate resources and services for SUD screening and follow-up care. The core components of the proposed innovation will consist of a remote screening tool for the assessment of patientsâ risk level of SUD and a chatbot to support logistical and routine queries. Our research team will utilize natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to create a scalable and sustainable solution to support an evidence-based SUD screening and treatment protocol. SUDCare has the potential to streamline follow-up clinic encounters and minimize the increasing workload burden placed on PCPs while filling a largely unfilled gap in care for hard-to- reach populations not directly served by any SUD therapeutic solutions available today. The goal of this SBIR Phase I project is to test technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of SUDCare. We will accomplish this goal using a user-centered design framework following three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will conduct semi- structured formative interviews with stakeholders (i.e., primary care providers, nurses, care coordinators, insurers, health IT specialists) and potential target end users (i.e., patients) (Substudy 1, N=20) recruited from our partnering primary care clinic. The data collected from this Substudy will be used to support the SUDCare development and requirements for integration with clinic workflow and systems. In Aim 2, we will build a working prototype of SUDCare. To create the chatbot prototype, we will train an English language model using a rich, existing de-identified dataset of text-message conversations from previous related work. Finally, in Aim 3, we will assess the acceptability of SUDCare through usability testing conducted with patients at risk of SUD (Substudy 2, N=8). Results from Phase I will inform a potential Phase II project to further develop SUDCare and conduct a larger-scaled pilot study to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of SUDCare. PROJECT NARRATIVE Substance use disorder (SUD) is a growing trend in the United States, and primary care providers have limited resources to help patients with prevention and treatment. In this Phase I SBIR, we will employ a user-centered design approach to develop and demonstrate the acceptability and feasibility of an innovative mobile- and web- based toolkit, SUDCare, for primary care patients who are at risk for SUD. SUDCare will be designed to comprehensively support SUD prevention and treatment following an empirically-based protocol through an enhanced remote screening tool and novel chatbot that delivers follow-up care tailored to the patientâs SUD risk level.",SUDCare: A smart mobile tool to support substance use screening and follow-up care,9897003,R43DA050218,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Assessment tool', 'Blinded', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Effectiveness', 'English Language', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Intelligence', 'Internet', 'Intervention Trial', 'Interview', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Screening procedure', 'Self Administration', 'Series', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'care providers', 'chatbot', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'handheld mobile device', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mobile application', 'model design', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'recruit', 'reduced substance use', 'referral services', 'satisfaction', 'screening', 'screening and brief intervention', 'screening, brief intervention, referral, and treatment', 'standard care', 'statistics', 'substance use prevention', 'tool', 'treatment program', 'trend', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual']",NIDA,"DIMAGI, INC.",R43,2020,229810,0.06069918012053114
"A software product that empowers individuals affected by substance use disorders and their care teams with health and social resources Project Summary Access to community resources such as housing, food, transportation and medication also known as social determinants of health (SDOH) has been shown to be critical for a successful treatment and recovery of substance use disorders (SUD). Therefore, case managers and social workers at various points-of-care (e.g. law enforcement sobering centers, primary health centers) dedicate time to identify community resources that may address their patientsâ health and social barriers. However, identifying competent community resources remains a challenge as they are usually stored in manual âreferral bindersâ which are highly duplicated and fragmented across organizations. Therefore, this significantly contributes to lack of direct access to recovery capital for individuals affected by SUD. Based on preliminary data and interviews with case managers and social workers, this SBIR Phase I study has two objectives. 1) Evaluate whether a co-creation led business model that will leverage partnerships with organizations that have SUD subject matter expertise (e.g. Houston Recovery Center - https://houstonrecoverycenter.org/) can provide enhanced access to SUD treatment services and community resources at the point-of-care. This is important as most points-of-care particularly primary health centers may not have care teams highly experienced in curating SUD related resources. Therefore, our innovation will facilitate the flow of SUD related community resources from organizations with SUD subject matter expertise to those without, such as primary health centers. 2) Establish the feasibility of a novel computational natural language processing (NLP) algorithm in matching health and social needs identified at the point-of-care to relevant and competent community resources. Our hypothesis is that the co-creation led business model coupled with a novel computational natural language processing (NLP) algorithm will lead to enhanced access to appropriate SUD recovery and healthcare resources. Finally, upon successful completion of Phase I, a future Phase II project will focus on establishing whether these innovations have a positive impact on the utilization of SUD recovery support services, encounters with law enforcement and EMS services. Project Narrative Social factors such as housing, transportation and medication have a significant impact on substance use treatment and recovery outcomes. This Phase I proposal will establish a novel co-creation model that leverages local community partnerships to curate community resources. In addition, our novel software technology prototype will match patientsâ health and social needs with resources at the point-of-care to improve the quality of care for patients with substance use disorders.",A software product that empowers individuals affected by substance use disorders and their care teams with health and social resources,9984913,R43DA051063,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Businesses', 'Capital', 'Caring', 'Case Manager', 'Client', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Distal', 'Employment', 'Food', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Services', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Law Enforcement', 'Licensing', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Quality of Care', 'Recovery', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Social Impacts', 'Social Work', 'Social Workers', 'Software Engineering', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'United States', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'commercialization', 'community partnership', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'opioid overdose', 'outreach', 'peer', 'phase 1 study', 'point of care', 'programs', 'prototype', 'relapse risk', 'social', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'societal costs', 'tool', 'treatment services']",NIDA,"MEDICAL INNOVATORS COMPANY, LLC",R43,2020,224865,0.04517966958221653
"Using Machine Learning Approaches to Examine Emotion-Related Brain Activity and Substance Use Among Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Substance use and substance use disorder are leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Importantly, most adults with substance use disorder begin using substances as adolescents, making adolescence an important period for the development of substance use disorder. Thus, it is critical to identify factors related to substance use among adolescents, consistent with NIDA objective 1.1. One factor linked to adolescent substance use is negative emotion processing. As adolescents undergo significant biological and psychosocial changes across development they may experience altered negative emotion processing that can lead to substance use if not appropriately regulated. Unfortunately, there is limited understanding in how neural level differences in negative emotion processing is related to substance use among adolescents. Moreover, extant neuroimaging research on negative emotion processing and substance use has employed univariate methods instead of multivariate methods. In contrast to univariate methods, multivariate methods are more sensitive in detecting patterns of neural activation across voxels and yield more generalizable and replicable findings overall. In addition, this research has employed standardized negative emotion paradigms, which have high experimental control, but may be less likely to reflect negative emotion processing as it occurs in the real world. To address these gaps in the literature, the proposed study will use multivariate machine learning approaches (i.e., multivoxel pattern analysis) to classify patterns of neural activation in a standardized negative emotion processing task and in a novel naturalistic negative emotion processing task that differentiate substance using adolescents from non-using adolescents, as well as predict substance use disorder risk factors. Additionally, the proposed study will use machine learning approaches to examine sex differences in emotion-related neural activation to these tasks in relation to substance use. This research will be conducted on a sample of 326 12-13 year old adolescents from Sponsorâs (Chaplin) competing renewal grant (RO1 DA033431-06A1). Knowledge from the proposed study will be used to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of adolescent substance use. Ultimately, these markers can be used to target at-risk adolescents in need of substance use prevention and intervention efforts. The goals of the proposed study will be accomplished within a research training plan aimed at developing multidisciplinary expertise in affective neuroscience, particularly in multivariate machine learning methods, and developmental models of substance use. The training plan includes completion of relevant coursework, attendance at targeted workshops, individual mentorship by experts in the field of development and neuroscience, and scientific writing and presentation experience. Project Narrative  This project uses machine learning fMRI approaches to investigate patterns of neural activation during negative emotion processing to classify and predict adolescent substance use. The goal of this research is to identify emotion-related neurobiological markers of substance use.

"Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Anxiety disorders in youth are highly prevalent [1] and impairing [2-4]. Left untreated, these disorders confer substantial additional risk for the development of a wide range of negative sequelae, including substance use [5], suicidal ideation and attempts [6], and additional mental health comorbidities [7]. Although several treatments have demonstrated efficacy for anxiety in youth, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT), family CBT (FCBT), medication (MED), and combination of CBT and medication (COMB) [8], a meaningful portion of youth are classified as non-responders after a full course of treatment [9]. The identification of baseline predictors and moderators of response is critical to improve treatment efficacy and reduce burden on families. Increased anxiety severity, comorbidity (behavioral problems, depression), and family psychopathology, along with older age, female gender and anxiety diagnosis, have been highlighted as potential predictors and moderators of outcome. However, studies have been underpowered and findings are inconsistent [10]. To date, all studies have taken a traditional analytic approach, which typically provides conservative estimates as a result of imposed explanatory constraints [11]. Machine Learning (ML) represents a promising complementary statistical technique to traditional analyses, given its focus on predictive fit rather than explanatory inference [12] and will facilitate identification of non-linear, complex patterns of predictors and moderators at the individual level [13, 14]. These methods have shown promise in identification of treatment outcome predictors in other medical [e.g., 15-18] and psychiatric samples [e.g., 19-22], but to date have not been implemented in a sample of anxious youth. The proposed project will aggregate datasets from at minimum ten peer-reviewed and published randomized controlled trials (N=1444) and train and validate two models along overlapping features, including (1) demographics, (2) diagnosis, (3) anxiety severity (4) behavioral problems, and (5) family psychopathology. Models will also be used to examine differential response to ICBT, FCBT, MED and COMB. Aggregated data will be uploaded into a centralized dataset, in line with the NIMH RDoC db and NDAR [23] datasets, and then used to predict outcome for individual anxious youth (N=80) completing ICBT and COMB at the Child and Adolescent Anxiety Disorders Clinic at Temple. The aims of this study are consistent with calls issued in the NIMH strategic plan (Objective 3) and will help facilitate the development of person-centered interventions for anxious youth [24]. An individualized approach to treatment is important to further increase treatment efficacy and reduce the financial and emotional burden associated with non-response [25, 26]. A training plan has been designed that consists of mentorship, formal classwork and experiential learning to develop the applicant's expertise in machine learning and dataset aggregation. The proposed study will take place within Temple University's clinical psychology program, which has a successful track record of conducting impactful NIMH-funded research and training research scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although several efficacious treatments have been identified for youth anxiety, there is significant heterogeneity in treatment response and this heterogeneity is poorly understood. To help clarify differences in treatment response and facilitate the development of person-centered interventions, novel and advanced statistical approaches should be implemented using adequately powered datasets. The proposed study will (1) use machine-learning methods to identify predictors and moderators of outcome in an aggregated dataset of at minimum ten Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) examining youth anxiety treatments (individual and family cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, and combination treatments), (2) create a centralized dataset of aggregated RCTs to foster continued cross-site collaboration and (3) test the model's predictive accuracy at the individual level in a real-world sample.",Using Machine Learning Methods to Predict Treatment Outcome for Anxious Youth,9990935,F31MH123038,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Emotional', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Social Anxiety Disorder', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Youth', 'active method', 'anxiety treatment', 'anxious', 'anxious individuals', 'base', 'childhood anxiety', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'demographics', 'depression model', 'design', 'expectation', 'family burden', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individual variation', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'parental role', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response', 'social anxiety', 'treatment response']",NIMH,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2020,33509,0.01990276615904275
"Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing ï»¿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Millions of Americans are receiving behavioral interventions for problematic alcohol use. In 2010, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) documented over 1.8 million treatment episodes for drug and alcohol problems, many involving group or individual psychotherapy. The tremendous service-delivery need has focused research on optimal training methods, to promote the dissemination of evidence-based interventions. A recent meta-analysis of motivational interviewing (MI) shows that ""post-training supports"" - such as performance-based feedback or coaching - are critical for maintaining counselor skills following training. However, the practical implementation of performance-based feedback for alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and problematic drinking is currently prohibitive in effort, time, and money. There is a critical need or technology to ""scale up"" performance-based feedback to counselors for AUDs and problematic drinking.  This competitive renewal builds on interdisciplinary research focused on automating the evaluation of MI fidelity for alcohol and substance use problems. This collaborative research brings together speech signal processing experts from electrical engineering and statistical text-mining and natural language processing experts from computer science with MI expert trainers and researchers. Our previous research laid a computational foundation for generating MI fidelity codes from semantic and vocal features, and the current proposal moves this work into direct clinical application. In collaboration with the University of Utah Counseling Center (UCC), we will develop and implement a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The CORE-MI system will provide performance-based feedback focused on MI fidelity codes for training, supervision, and quality assurance for counselors treating clients struggling with alcohol and substance use problems.  The research will use a hybrid implementation-effectiveness design to pursue the following three aims: 1) Implement and calibrate the CORE-MI system at the UCC clinic to provide automated, performance-based feedback on MI; 2) Compare counselor fidelity to MI and client alcohol and substance use outcomes, before and after initiation of the CORE-MI system (approximately, N = 2,400 sessions); and 3) Using machine learning tools, computationally explore mechanisms of MI using semantic and vocal data, MI fidelity codes, and client outcomes from approximately 3,000 sessions. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Performance-based feedback is an effective method for training and supervising counseling approaches for alcohol-related problems. However, current feedback methods rely on human raters and are not feasible in the real-world due to time and cost. The current study will implement a clinical support software tool that uses speech signal processing and computational models - instead of human judgment - to evaluate motivational interviewing for alcohol and substance use problems.",Implementation of Technology-Based Evaluation of Motivational Interviewing,9988982,R01AA018673,"['Acoustics', 'Addictive Behavior', 'Alcohol abuse', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical effectiveness', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Empathy', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based intervention', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Group Psychotherapy', 'Homicide', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention Studies', 'Judgment', 'Learning', 'Learning Skill', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Psychologist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration', 'Universities', 'Utah', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol intervention', 'alcohol related problem', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical implementation', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'drinking', 'effectiveness implementation study', 'high risk drinking', 'improved', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'public health relevance', 'quality assurance', 'scale up', 'service delivery', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'software infrastructure', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'technology validation', 'text searching', 'tool', 'vehicular accident', 'visual feedback', 'young adult']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,562148,0.005363038254433482
"Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis PROJECT SUMMARY  The opioid overdose crisis emerged in predominantly White communities, but the opioid-related mortality rate is increasing most rapidly in the Black population. A key driver of the crisis is opioid use disorder, which affects over 2 million Americans. Despite their effectiveness, medications for opioid use disorder remain underused, especially among Black Americans. Compared to White Americans, Black Americans have lower access to medications for opioid use disorder, are one-third as likely to initiate treatment, and have lower retention in care. Black Americans face unique structural obstacles to care, such as mistrust of the health care system, lack of representation among medical providers, and racially-biased providersâ perceptions. There is a critical gap in our understanding of the structural factors associated with treatment initiation and retention in care for Black patients with OUD. The scientific objective of this research plan is to identify modifiable structural factors at the community, provider, and facility levels that affect treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder in the Black population. This innovative project proposes to leverage machine learning-based causal inference methods with a combination of large national electronic medical records, corporate data warehouses, and publicly available data. By combining multiple data sources, this project will empirically evaluate modifiable factors such as provider characteristics (e.g., years of experience, patient satisfaction scores), facility characteristics (e.g., mental health staffing to patient ratios, number of buprenorphine-eligible prescribers), and patient-provider characteristics (e.g., number of previous visits or interactions). While focused on promoting equitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder in Black Americans, the public health implications of this proposal are expected to apply broadly to ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders and reduce health disparities. This research plan is complemented by a career development plan that builds on the applicantâs background in epidemiology and biostatistics. Specifically, this career development plan outlines new training in three areas: (1) the clinical treatment of opioid use disorder, (2) analysis of the massive data of electronic medical records, and (3) machine learning-based causal inference methods. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career identifying, evaluating, and implementing multilevel interventions to reduce racial/ethnic inequalities in treatment for substance use disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Opioid use disorder is a key driver of the U.S. opioid overdose crisis, yet treatment remains both underused and unequal. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it focuses on identifying modifiable structural predictors of treatment initiation and retention in care for opioid use disorder. The results of this project are expected to inform multilevel interventions equitably deliver treatment for opioid use disorder, ameliorate the overall health burden of substance use disorders, and reduce health disparities.",Reducing racial disparities in the treatment of opioid use disorder using machine learning-based causal analysis,10039535,K99DA051534,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'African American', 'American', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Buprenorphine', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Client satisfaction', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Communities', 'Community Surveys', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development Plans', 'Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Individual', 'Inequality', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural experiment', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment outcome', 'Veterans', 'Visit', 'Work', 'barrier to care', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caucasian American', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'forest', 'health administration', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data sources', 'novel strategies', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use disorder', 'prescription opioid', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial disparity', 'skills', 'social', 'standard of care', 'success', 'treatment disparity']",NIDA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,179582,0.05809904093073172
"Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone and the Adaptive Treatment for Cocaine Dependence trials, sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for alcohol or/and cocaine dependent patients. One of the main challenges in these trials is the high rate of noncompliance to the assigned treatments. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of an adaptive treatment strategy (ATS) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal ATS is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Existing methods in analyzing SMART data are limited to intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses. That is the treatment effect at each stage is estimated based on the treatment group to which an individual was randomized at that stage regardless of whether the individual complied with their assigned treatment. One major concern is that the relationship between the experimental manipulation and the outcome may be confounded by treatment noncompliance. We develop methodologies that can be used to adjust for noncompliance in analyzing data collected in SMARTs. Specifically, we extend the principal strata framework and Bayesian Copulas to multi-stage randomized trials setting and propose novel procedures that estimate the mean outcome under different ATSs. We also propose a novel Bayesian machine learning approach that can be used to construct deeply tailored (i.e., individualized) treatment strategies that take into account patients' demographic factors, measures of mental health and alcohol use, obsessive-compulsive drinking and alcohol craving scales, physical composite scores. Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available open-source software leveraging the R and Python languages that implements our methods. This will provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal ATSs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for analysis of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (SMARTs) data in the presence of partial compliance. The methods developed in this project will improve the usefulness, interpretability and generalizability of the results obtained by SMARTs and help mental health and substance use disorder scientists to develop more potent adaptive treatment strategies to guide the individualization of mental health and substance use disorder treatments.","Analyzing Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trials in the Presence of Partial Compliance",10017030,R01DA048764,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcoholism', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian learning', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Demographic Factors', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Joints', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Procedures', 'Pythons', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'alcohol abuse therapy', 'alcohol craving', 'arm', 'base', 'compliance behavior', 'design', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'non-compliance', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient response', 'randomized trial', 'repository', 'response', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'treatment group', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2020,191907,0.046663210826527746
"Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders Project Summary/Abstract Substance use costs society $740 billion dollars each year, placing an enormous burden on our nationâs health care and criminal justice systems. Approximately 85% of incarcerated offenders in the United States have a history of substance use and/or are imprisoned for crimes involving or motivated by alcohol and/or drug use. Incarcerated individuals tend to show poorer outcomes following substance use treatment, and forced abstinence via imprisonment is associated with risk for future substance use, which likely contributes to substance-related antisocial behavior following imprisonment. Over the past few decades, women have been sentenced to prison for drug-related reasons at alarming rates, with a growth rate exceeding that for men. Further, women offenders tend to be impacted more heavily by substance use with co-morbid psychopathology, placing greater demands on the system in terms of substance use and mental health treatments. Using the worldâs largest forensic neuroimaging database on women offenders (SWANC-F), this proposal investigates substance use and related antisocial behavior following release from prison in a large sample of women offenders, with a focus on neurobiological mechanisms, to demonstrate the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women. Substance-related antisocial behavior, defined as committing crime(s) related to substance use after release from prison, will be obtained from re-arrest data in institutional files and comprehensive background checks on all women enrolled in the study. A random sample (n = 100) will then be followed-up with via phone to gather data on substance use and obtain supplemental information to corroborate re-arrest data from files and background checks. Employing regression analyses and machine learning/pattern classifier approaches, models will be compared testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic variables, along with resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) brain measures, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes of interest in women. Specifically, this proposal seeks to test the extent to which psychiatric and socioeconomic factors confer risk for substance-related antisocial behavior following release from prison in women (Aim 1), and integrates and compares the utility of rsFC brain measures in improving these prediction models (Aim 2). Then, similar methods will be applied to test the prediction of substance use following release from prison (Aim 3). It is expected that psychiatric risk factors and socioeconomic protective factors, as well as rsFC brain measures, will be useful in predicting substance use and related antisocial behavior following incarceration, along with time elapsed between release from prison and initiation of substance use and related behavior. Testing factors that aid in predicting these behaviors in women has the potential to be far-reaching by informing the development of targeted treatments, including those that help to account for sex differences and co-morbid conditions related to substance use. Project Narrative Women represent one of the fastest growing segments of substance users in the United States, with a growth rate of substance-related offending exceeding that of men; however, women continue to be one of the most underserved populations in substance use research. This proposal will compare statistical models testing effects of psychiatric and socioeconomic factors, along with resting-state functional connectivity in and between cognitive control, decision-making, and reward-processing neural circuitry, to examine unique and combined effects in differentiating among heterogeneous etiological mechanisms driving substance use outcomes in women. The primary goal of this proposal is to examine the utility of brain measures in estimating long-term substance use outcomes in at-risk women in an effort to help inform future treatment efforts.","Predicting Substance Use and Related Antisocial Behavior with Psychiatric, Socioeconomic, and Brain Measures in Women Offenders",10001326,F31DA047048,"['Abstinence', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anterior', 'Anxiety', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Crime', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Drug usage', 'Economics', 'Education', 'Employment', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Fibrinogen', 'Forensic Medicine', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imprisonment', 'Individual', 'Insula of Reil', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Marital Status', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Odds Ratio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prisons', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sex Differences', 'Societies', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Underserved Population', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'anti social', 'antisocial behavior', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'cognitive control', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'data structure', 'design', 'feature selection', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hazard', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'neural circuit', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offender', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'predictive modeling', 'protective factors', 'psychopathic personality', 'reward processing', 'social', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'support vector machine']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO,F31,2020,36051,0.14576771345822978
"Multisite Electronic Health Record-based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Children and Adolescents Diabetes is a common chronic disease in children and adolescents under age of 18 years. In the recent two decades, both the prevalence and incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) have been increasing considerably among US children and adolescents. T2D now accounts for ~15% of diabetes cases diagnosed in childhood and adolescence. The SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study is the only ongoing multisite surveillance study of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents. The SEARCH study is a population-based registry, which is a more expensive, more labor-intensive, and slower surveillance method compared with a surveillance system using electronic health records (EHRs). EHR algorithms have shown great potential in identifying diabetes cases. This study will analyze both structured EHR data (e.g., diagnosis codes, medications, and laboratory results) and unstructured clinical notes. We will apply expert knowledge, machine learning, and natural language processing to develop the best algorithms for identifying prevalent and incident T1D and T2D cases. The primary objective of this study is to establish an EHR-based surveillance system for monitoring the burden of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents. We will collaborate with 3 EHR research networks from the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet), covering ~3 million racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse children and adolescents from 4 states (IL, LA, NY, and TX) in 3 Census regions. The patient populations in this study are roughly representative of the source populations in the catchment areas. The specific aims of this study are 1) to estimate the prevalence of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 2) to estimate the incidence of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region in 2019; 3) to estimate 10-year trends in the prevalence and incidence of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region, 2014-2023; and 4) to compare the prevalence and incidence of diabetes by type, as well as temporal trends, in US children and adolescents with those in children and adolescents from other countries and regions. This study is innovative because it will leverage EHRs for surveillance (more efficient and cost-effective than registries and surveys), use advanced statistical approaches (e.g., machine learning and natural language processing), estimate a denominator using patient zip codes, build flexibility into the surveillance methods according to local availability of clinical notes, and use a 2-staged sampling approach to improve chart review efficiency. All 4 states in this study do not have an active diabetes surveillance system for children and adolescents and are not covered by the SEARCH study. This study will advance our understanding of the geographic, age, sex, and racial/ethnic differences in the burden of T1D and T2D in US children and adolescents. The obtained surveillance data will help identify and prioritize subpopulations for prevention of diabetes and related comorbidities to reduce health disparities. The burden of type 1 and type 2 diabetes has been increasing considerably among US children and adolescents. A population-based registry, which is expensive and labor-intensive, has provided estimates for the prevalence and incidence of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents from limited geographic regions in the US. This study will build an efficient and cost-effective multisite surveillance system using electronic health records covering several other geographic regions, to estimate the prevalence, incidence, and trends of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in US children and adolescents according to age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region.",Multisite Electronic Health Record-based Surveillance of the Burden of Diabetes by Type in Children and Adolescents,10085447,U18DP006503,[' '],NCCDPHP,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,U18,2020,250000,0.014664999053222475
"Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD Project Summary The goal of this proposal is to elucidate neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in early adolescent PTSD. Notably, deficits in directly learned fear extinction are implicated in adult PTSD. However, youth with PTSD live within the family system, which could impact their ability to extinguish trauma memories. Indeed, abnormal parent-child transmission of fear following trauma is a potent risk factor for youth PTSD. Furthermore, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), the gold-standard treatment for pediatric PTSD, uses exposure therapy of the child's trauma narrative for both youth and their caregiver. Here, TF-CBT aims to promote extinction of trauma-related fear both directly in the child and vicariously through parent modeling. However, no reported studies have examined the cumulative impact of direct and vicarious fear extinction in pediatric PTSD. Finally, the diagnosis of PTSD in youth continues to rely on DSM syndromal criteria, creating a great need to establish objective, biologically based diagnoses. This innovative research program will (1) identify physiological impairments in direct/vicarious fear extinction and their unique contributions to adolescent PTSD, (2) identify the neural substrates of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction learning in adolescent PTSD, and (3) use machine learning on biomarkers of fear acquisition and direct/vicarious extinction to classify trauma exposure and PTSD diagnosis in adolescents. This interdisciplinary research team will recruit 40 non-traumatized typically developing (TD) youth, 40 trauma- exposed comparison (TEC) youth without mental illness, and 80 medication-free youth with PTSD, ages 10-14, along with their primary caregiving parent. Youth and parents will undergo fear acquisition followed by a novel fear extinction paradigm. Here, youth will undergo two extinction training conditions: 1) direct extinction and 2) vicarious extinction by observing their parent complete extinction training. Parent/child skin conductance and corrugator EMG will be measured during all fear protocol phases. Additionally, youth will complete all fear phases during fMRI to probe neural substrates of fear acquisition, and direct and vicarious extinction. Following physiological and fMRI analyses, a deep evolutionary machine learning approach will be applied to youth neurophysiological fear indices to classify trauma and PTSD status. Primary analyses will 1) examine physiological markers of direct and vicarious extinction in youth and their relative contribution to PTSD, 2) examine neural abnormalities during direct and vicarious extinction in adolescent PTSD, and 3) determine whether adding vicarious extinction markers enhances machine learning classification of youth trauma and PTSD status. This ambitious program of parent-child extinction learning promises to yield the first comprehensive set of neurophysiological markers of pediatric PTSD that will allow for objective, rational targeting of treatment in the parent-child dyad to improve outcomes for afflicted youth. Project Narrative This project seeks to conduct the first comprehensive, biological study of how parent-child fear and safety learning contribute to adolescent PTSD. This project will establish biomarkers of parent-child safety learning in adolescent PTSD, and test whether machine learning can use these markers to diagnose PTSD in youth. This research would represent a significant advance beyond subjective assessments currently used in clinical settings, paving the way towards biologically-based diagnosis and treatment of youth PTSD within the family context.",Neurobehavioral mechanisms of parent-child extinction learning in adolescent PTSD,10074037,R01MH117141,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Testing', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Exhibits', 'Extinction (Psychology)', 'Face Processing', 'Family', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Galvanic Skin Response', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Parents', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Stimulus', 'Structural defect', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Work', 'Youth', 'aged', 'base', 'caregiving', 'early adolescence', 'girls', 'imaging platform', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning extinction', 'male', 'neural circuit', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'programs', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'standard care', 'transmission process', 'trauma exposure']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2020,18249,0.06872675352853916

"Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder ABSTRACT This application represents our ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of substance use disorders (SUDs). This research is achieved through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data that combine clinical symptoms and diagnoses, imaging markers, and genotypes. The team has a PI with expertise in computational science and the development and implementation of innovative statistical algorithms to understand multidimensional data; a PI with extensive experience in systems, imaging and addiction neuroscience; and a co-I who has expertise in the genetics of SUDs. Our previous R01 project employed a sample of ~12,000 individuals aggregated from multiple genetic studies of alcohol and drug dependence to generate SUD subtypes based on clinical symptoms. Because clinical manifestations are distal endpoints in the biological pathway, the genetic effects identified are often weak and inconsistent, and consequently difficult to detect even in large samples. As championed by the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) research, the etiologies of psychiatric disorders, including SUDs, can be fruitfully characterized by dimensional neural features. This project thus extends our ongoing work to include imaging neural features in the classification of SUDs. Specifically, we will utilize a large database from the UK Biobank Project that provides both genetic and multi-modality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Building on our work with the US Human Connectome Project, we aim in the current project to integrate clinical, imaging, and genotype data to investigate the neurobiological substrates of SUD diagnostic labels, and to derive SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. Methodologically, we replace the classic statistical analysis that is confirmatory and biased to an a priori hypothesis by an approach that emphasizes pattern discoveries from big data. Our specific aims are to: (I): identify neuroimaging features that represent robust markers of addiction and differentiate SUD subtypes that can be confirmed by multi-modality evidence; (II) employ a novel brain connectivity model, on the basis of graph convolutional neural networks, to identify neural markers that precisely characterize the differences in structural changes and functional circuits related to SUDs; and (III) derive an innovative machine learning model to identify highly heritable neurobiological subtypes of SUDs that facilitate investigation of the genetic basis of addiction. We will focus on alcohol and nicotine use disorders to demonstrate the conceptual and methodological approaches. We believe that, by providing a productive conceptual and methodological platform to integrate imaging and genetic data to understand the etiologies of SUDs, this research is highly responsive to the RFA âLeveraging Big Data Science to Elucidate the Neural Mechanisms of Addiction and SUD.â The machine learning tools developed for this project will provide an innovative and reliable foundation to enhance the aggregation and analysis of multidimensional data, and to meet the diagnostic and predictive challenges in mental health research. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify and differentiate subtypes of alcohol and nicotine use disorders by combining neural markers, genotype data, and clinical diagnostic information. The proposed analytics will be tested in a large database of alcohol and nicotine use disorders from the UK Biobank project. The proposed approaches will advance precision medicine by refining disease classification and facilitating gene finding for addictive and other mental disorders.",Multi-level statistical classification of substance use disorder,10056455,R01DA051922,"['Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Science', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10)', 'Investigation', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine Use Disorder', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Variant', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'big-data science', 'biobank', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cocaine use', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'data structure', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'executive function', 'experience', 'falls', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging genetics', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'network models', 'neural correlate', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'risk variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'structured data', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment response', 'whole genome']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R01,2020,465370,-0.008002311476440795
"Modified Use of E-cigarettes and Marketing on YouTube PROJECT SUMMARY E-cigarette use among U.S. youth is a significant public health problem. Understanding youth appeal of e- cigarettes and marketing strategies targeting youth is critical to inform the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)âs goal to prevent youth e-cigarette use. A significant youth appeal is the ability to modify e-cigarettes or to âhackâ the devices or e-liquid constituents for unintended purposes (e.g., using at higher temperatures or for a longer period of time, adding their own e-liquids made with nicotine or THC oil). However, it is largely unknown how youth modify e-cigarette devices or their components, their perceptions of these behaviors, and marketing strategies used to endorse these behaviors. YouTube, a popular social media, can be examined to understand modified uses of e-cigarettes and marketing associated with these behaviors. The overall goal of this study is to understand ways in which youth modify e-cigarettes, their motivations for doing so, and marketing sources, using YouTube analysis, survey methodology, and expert evaluation. We will identify modified uses of e-cigarettes and marketing using fictitious youth YouTube viewer profiles to search for e-cigarettes using a browser plug-in and custom scripted web-crawling and then machine learning to automatically code the videos to identify e-cigarette modifications and marketing source. Our Advisory Committee (AC) of subject matter experts in tobacco regulatory science, social media, youth tobacco use, toxicology, communications, and tobacco marketing will apply their knowledge to assess the potential impact of these identified modified uses on appeal, addiction, and health effects of e-cigarettes to identify those which are amenable to FDA regulations and communications. We will then conduct an in-depth analysis of these selected behaviors using a combination of machine learning and detailed human coding on youth-accessible YouTube videos to understand: 1) components that are modified (e.g., batteries, cartridges/pods, e-liquids), 2) motivations for modification (e.g., enhance user experience, reduce perceived harm), 3) marketing sources (e.g., online shops, pro-e-cigarette organizations), and 4) appeal (number of likes, views). We will also use an online survey with adolescent and young adult e-cigarette users (N=1000) to examine the prevalence, appeal, motivations, risk perceptions, and marketing exposure related to these modified uses and their predictors (i.e., demographic variables, past-month e-cigarette use frequency, e-cigarette dependence, other tobacco/substance use, interpersonal and intrapersonal risk factors). The results of this study will provide the FDA with novel evidence to 1) develop regulations to prohibit the manufacturing and marketing of e-cigarette components that can be modified by youth, 2) restrict youth-accessible marketing of e-cigarettes on social media such as YouTube, and 3) develop prevention campaigns to educate youth about the harms of modifying e-cigarettes. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: E-cigarette use among youth is high; thus, to inform youth e-cigarette prevention, we will examine the youth appeal of the product, such as the ability to modify or âhackâ the devices and their related components for unintended uses and marketing on popular social media, YouTube. We will use mixed-methods (i.e., machine learning, survey methodology, expert evaluation) to achieve our aim. The results of this study will provide the FDA with novel evidence to develop regulations to prohibit the manufacturing and marketing of e-cigarette components that can be modified, restrict youth-accessible marketing of e-cigarettes on YouTube, and develop prevention campaigns to educate youth about the harms of engaging in these behaviors.",Modified Use of E-cigarettes and Marketing on YouTube,9981285,R01DA049878,"['Address', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Behavior', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Devices', 'Electronic cigarette', 'Esthesia', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High temperature of physical object', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Industry', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Marketing', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Motivation', 'Nicotine', 'Oils', 'Perception', 'Plug-in', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research Methodology', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Source', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Time', 'Tobacco', 'Tobacco use', 'Toxicology', 'United States Food and Drug Administration', 'Youth', 'addiction', 'demographics', 'electronic cigarette use', 'electronic cigarette user', 'electronic liquid', 'experience', 'male', 'marijuana vaping', 'novel', 'preference', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'risk perception', 'sex', 'social', 'social media', 'tobacco advertising', 'tobacco regulatory science', 'vaping', 'web site']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,453703,0.03627932408145342
"Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing Millions of Americans receive evidence-based counseling for substance use problems each year. Many  evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are âtalk basedâ therapies, such as motivational  interviewing (MI), but the existing research-based methodology for evaluating counseling quality is  to record sessions and use human rating teams to evaluate them. However, using humans as the  assessment tool via behavioral coding is prohibitive in cost and time, can be error prone, and is  virtually never used in the real world. Technology is needed that can analyze the speech patterns and spoken language of counseling  sessions, provide automatic and intuitive quality scores, and summarize these in actionable  feedback. Rapid, performance-based quality metrics could support training, ongoing supervision, and  quality assurance for millions of evidence-based counseling sessions for substance abuse each year. Lyssn.io is a start-up targeting the development of implementation-focused technology to support  evidence-based counseling.  Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are  objective, scalable, and cost efficient. Lyssn.io includes expertise in speech signal processing,  machine learning, user-centered design, software engineering, and clinical expertise in evidence-based counseling.  Previous NIH-funded research laid a computational foundation for generating MI quality metrics from  speech and language features in MI sessions, and led to a prototype of a clinical software support  tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The current Fast-Track SBIR proposal includes Phase I, which will focus on understanding clinical  workflows, assessing usability, and initial validation of machine learning of MI fidelity measures  in the opioid treatment program at Evergreen Treatment Services (ETS) clinic in Seattle, WA. Phase  II will focus on robust validation of the speech and language technologies underlying the CORE-MI  tool, and development of scalable supervision protocols that integrate CORE-MI supported feedback  for counselors. Finally, we will conduct a quasi-experimental evaluation of CORE-MI supported  supervision and training at a second ETS clinic in the Puget Sound, focusing on acceptability,  usability, and adoption, the impact on supervision, improved MI fidelity and preliminary evidence  of increased client retention.  The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on  human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the  capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance in MI for substance abuse. Most evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are in-person psychotherapy and counseling  interventions, such as motivational interviewing. There are currently no methods for evaluating the  quality of such counseling interventions in the real world to support training, supervision, and  quality assurance. Building on an existing prototype, Lyssn.io â a technology start-up focused on  scalable and cost-efficient human-centered technologies â will enhance and evaluate a cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant clinical support software tool that uses automated speech recognition and machine learning in an community  based opioid replacement clinic.","Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing",9930480,R44DA046243,"['Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavioral', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Primary Health Care', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychotherapy', 'Research', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Supervision', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'Transcript', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'automated speech recognition', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'design', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'opioid treatment program', 'primary care setting', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'signal processing', 'sound', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support tools', 'technology validation', 'tool development', 'treatment services', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual']",NIDA,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R44,2020,134649,-0.013446660528365736
"Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement Youth violence is a key public health problem. Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents (age:14- 20) and disproportionately impacts African-American populations. Urban EDs are a critical opportunity for violence prevention, especially with >600,000 adolescents/year seeking treatment for violence-related injuries. In our longitudinal study of violently-injured adolescents in urban EDs, we found that within 2-years, 37% returned for a repeat violent injury, 59% experienced firearm violence, 38% were arrested, and 1% died. Despite the importance of the problem, strategies to decrease repeat violence after an ED visit have not been well studied. Given our prior work demonstrating that theoretically-based single session ED interventions are efficacious reducing violence among lower risk adolescents, the application of this therapy, expanded to address greater problem severity over multiple sessions and enhanced by including care management, represents a potentially efficacious approach for altering risk trajectories of higher-risk violently-injured adolescents. Our recent pilot of this approach (S-RTI) was well received and addressed problems identified in prior multisession interventions (e.g., transportation) with the addition of remote therapy delivery (e.g., phone). While innovative and promising, this S-RTI approach is resource intensive and does not address heterogeneity in treatment responses. By contrast, adaptive treatment strategies allow for âjust-in-timeâ tailoring that provides a balance between too much and not enough intervention and enhances outcomes while reducing the use of costly resources. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence domain that allows computer systems to âlearnâ from the success of prior treatments and is a promising approach to constructing adaptive âjust-in-timeâ interventions. For this study, we propose to test two versions of our RTI, a standard RTI condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions, and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by reinforcement learning to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two- way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. The specific aims are: 1) To refine and adapt our RTI for delivery using two packages (S-RTI; AI-RTI); 2) To conduct a 3-arm RCT enrolling 900 violently-injured adolescents seeking ED care (age:14-20) to compare the efficacy of S-RTI (n=300), AI-RTI (n=400), and a control condition (n=200); and, 3) To evaluate adaptability of the AI-RTI RL algorithm by comparing the first 50% of enrollees to the second 50% on process variables (e.g., engagement, helpfulness/likability). Primary outcomes (assessed at 4-, 8-, and 12-months) include aggression, victimization, and ED recidivism for violent injury. Secondary outcomes include substance use, mental health symptoms, and criminal justice involvement. As a secondary aim, we will compare resource utilization (i.e., costs/event averted) for the active intervention conditions. Given elevated rates of violence among socio-disadvantaged youth with disparities in access to services, the proposed study has the potential for significant public health impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE Homicide is a leading cause of death among adolescent youth, and disproportionately affects African-American populations. This study, conducted among a sample of adolescents (14-20 years old) seeking treatment in an urban emergency department (ED) for violent injuries, aims to refine, adapt, and test two versions of our previously piloted violence intervention, a standard remote therapy condition (S-RTI) comprised of a single ED therapy session followed by 8 remote therapy sessions and an adaptive RTI version (AI-RTI) optimized by an artificial intelligence algorithm (i.e., reinforcement learning) to step up or down the intensity of treatment between three treatment levels (i.e., remote therapy sessions, automated two-way text messaging, assessment only) based on patient response to daily text message assessments. Given elevated rates of violence among socio- disadvantaged adolescents with disparities in access to services, the proposed intervention, if efficacious, has the potential for significant public health impact, especially in low-resource urban communities.",Using Re-inforcement Learning to Automatically Adapt a Remote Therapy Intervention (RTI) for Reducing Adolescent Violence Involvement,9915957,R01HD097107,"['20 year old', 'Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Caring', 'Caucasians', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Systems', 'Criminal Justice', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Dose', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency department visit', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Health', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Heterogeneity', 'Homicide', 'Hospitals', 'Imprisonment', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Minority', 'Modality', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Public Health', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Sampling', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Text Messaging', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Transportation', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Variant', 'Victimization', 'Violence', 'Violent injury', 'Work', 'Youth', 'arm', 'base', 'comparative efficacy', 'cost', 'experience', 'gun violence', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'learning algorithm', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'preservation', 'primary outcome', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'recidivism', 'secondary outcome', 'societal costs', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'success', 'theories', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'violence prevention', 'youth violence']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2020,654495,0.0565922246509454
"Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data ABSTRACT This Independent Scientist Award will significantly enhance my research capabilities, enabling me to become a leading quantitative investigator in the field of substance use disorders (SUDs). Specifically, it will allow me to increase my knowledge in the areas of SUD phenotypes, treatment and genetics. SUDs are clinically and etiologically heterogeneous and their classification has been difficult. This application reflects my ongoing commitment to developing an innovative and interdisciplinary research program on the classification of SUDs through quantitative analysis of multidimensional data. My extensive training in computational science and prior research on biomedical informatics have provided me with the skills to design, implement and evaluate advanced algorithms and sophisticated analyses to solve challenging problems in classifying SUDs. My ongoing NIDA-funded R01 employs a large (n=~12,000) sample aggregated from multiple genetic studies of cocaine, opioid, and alcohol dependence to develop and evaluate novel statistical models to generate clinical SUD subtypes that are optimized for gene finding. This K02 proposal extends that work to evaluate treatment outcome in refined subgroups of SUD populations using data from treatment studies for cocaine, opioid, alcohol and multiple substance dependence. This project will integrate data from diagnostic behavioral variables and genotypes, as well as biological/neurobiological features of the disorders and repeated measures of treatment outcome. The primary career development goals of this application are to: (1) understand the reliability, validity and functional mechanisms of various phenotyping methods; (2) to continue training in the genetics of addictions; and (3) to gain greater knowledge of different treatment approaches and their efficacy. A solid foundation in these areas will enhance my ability to realize the full potential of the data collected and aggregated from multiple dimensions, and to use the data to design the most clinically useful analysis and generate innovative solutions to diagnostic and predictive challenges in SUD research. Through formal coursework, directed readings, individual tutoring and intensive multidisciplinary collaboration with a diverse team of world-renowned researchers, I will receive training and collect pilot data for future R01 projects by examining (Aim I): whether clinically-defined highly heritable subtypes derived in my current R01 project predict differential treatment response; (Aim II) whether new statistical models that directly combine treatment data with behavioral, biological, and genomic data identify refined subtypes with confirmatory multilevel evidence; and (Aim III) whether there are genetic and social moderators of treatment outcome by subtype. The overall goal of this proposal is to further my independent and multidisciplinary research program in the development of statistical methods for refined classification of SUDs. The K02 award will provide me with the protected time necessary to fully engage in the training activities described that will enhance my knowledge and skills to enable me to make important, novel contributions to the genetics and treatment of SUD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop novel statistical and quantitative tools to identify homogeneous subtypes of substance use disorders (SUDs) and other complex diseases to enhance gene finding and treatment matching. The proposed project will perform secondary analyses of existing data from treatment studies of cocaine, opioid, alcohol, and mixed SUDs. The proposed novel approaches are expected to advance precision medicine approaches to SUDs by enabling treatment matching and a more refined SUD classification to gene finding.",Classifying addictions using machine learning analysis of multidimensional data,9851853,K02DA043063,"['Adherence', 'Aftercare', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biosensor', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Collaborations', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'DSM-IV', 'DSM-V', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Drug Use Disorder', 'Electroencephalography', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurobiology', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacogenetics', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Reading', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'biomarker performance', 'biomedical informatics', 'career development', 'cocaine use', 'contingency management', 'design', 'disease classification', 'disorder subtype', 'endophenotype', 'genetic association', 'genomic data', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidimensional data', 'neural correlate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'opioid use disorder', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'recruit', 'secondary analysis', 'skills', 'social', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tutoring']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,K02,2020,161422,0.038290047379223105
"Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers Project Summary: The cyclical and heterogeneous nature of many substance use disorders highlights the need to adapt the type or the dose of treatment to accommodate the specific and changing needs of individuals. This proposal is motivated by the Extending Treatment Effectiveness of Naltrexone (ExTENd) trial, a sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) designed to find a (personalized) rescue treatment for those who are non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. One of the main challenges in this trial is the presence of the many variables available for consideration when making treatment decisions at each stage of the trial. This feature has made it virtually impossible for investigators to fully explore the possibility of building high quality treatment strategies using the data. Our overarching aim is to address this particular challenge through developing and subsequently applying new statistical methods to the ExTENd trial data. A SMART trial is a multi-stage trial that can inform the design of a dynamic treatment regime (DTR) which formalizes an individualized treatment plan and where current treatment strategy can depend on a patient's past medical and treatment history. An optimal DTR is one that maximizes a specified health outcome of interest. Q-learning can be used with data from both SMARTs and observational studies to estimate an optimal DTR. However, like other model-based approaches, model misspecification can seriously affect the results and lead to the identification of suboptimal DTRs. The potential for misspecification increases with the number of variables that may influence treatment decisions through, e.g., incorrect assumptions on the relationship of variables to the outcome and the inclusion (exclusion) of unimportant (important) variables. These features represent the main analytical challenges for the ExTENd trial. We propose a new approach to Q-learning that leverages machine learning approaches to reduce the chances of misspecifying the relationship between the expected outcome and a given set of variables. We also develop a variable selection technique specifically designed for Q-learning that enables investigators to select the important variables from a long list of possibilities (e.g., genetic and demographic information, medical history over time) when estimating an optimal DTR. In both settings, we will develop new methods for conducting valid inferences (e.g., confidence intervals and p-values), including when there exist patients for whom treatment is neither beneficial nor harmful at a given decision stage (i.e., when an important technical assumption, âuniquenessâ, is violated). Finally, we will develop easy-to-use, publicly available software in the R language that implements our methods. This will allow re-analysis of the ExTENd trial data with a goal of constructing a DTR that improves upon the current rescue treatment strategy for those non-responsive to initial Naltrexone. It will also provide an expandable platform that will assist researchers in developing new optimal DTRs for patients suffering from alcoholism and other substance use disorders. Narrative: This project aims to address the need for robust, rigorous and computationally efficient methods for estimating the optimal treatment regime in substance use disorder. We will develop a variable selection technique that enables investigators to select important variables for the decision- making process among a long list of variables (e.g., patientâs genetic information, demographic characteristics, and medical history over time). We will also leverage statistical machine learning approaches to improve the quality of the constructed optimal treatment regimes while providing valid statistical inference.",Optimal dynamic treatment strategies for controlling alcohol use: novel methods for selecting and incorporating effect modifiers,9953933,R21AA027571,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol dependence', 'Alcoholism', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Dose', 'Exclusion', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical History', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Naltrexone', 'Nature', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Randomized', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment Protocols', 'Work', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'dosage', 'expectation', 'falls', 'genetic information', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'optimal treatments', 'overtreatment', 'personalized medicine', 'repository', 'response', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'trial design', 'virtual']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R21,2020,185591,0.04863829596538178
"Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care USING ADMINISTRATIVE AND CLINICAL DATA TO DETECT DRUG USE AND HIV RISK IN FOSTER CARE Project Summary  The candidate's goal is to develop an independent research career as a developmental psychologist focused on identifying mechanisms to prevent the onset of pervasive and detrimental health risk behaviors, including substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors, among adolescents and young adults involved in foster care. She has experience in examining psychosocial and behavioral processes during this period of development and a strong publication record for the current phase in her career. Her previous training has emphasized development during adolescence and the transition to adulthood and health behaviors during this timeframe. In the K01, she proposes to expand her training to become an expert leader in team science approaches to address substance use and HIV risk behaviors during adolescence and the transition to adulthood, specifically focusing on foster youth, using child welfare administrative data and electronic medical records (EMR). Her training will emphasize: 1) development as an independent researcher and leader in interdisciplinary approaches to addressing health and development among foster youth, 2) substantive training in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors, and 3) the use of machine learning to distinguish youth at risk, with the end goal of identifying opportunities for prevention. This will be accomplished through seminars and journal clubs offered at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), attending regional and national conferences and trainings on substantive topics, and completion of coursework in child maltreatment and machine learning. Finally, she will complete coursework and seminars addressing the ethical conduct of research. Dr. Beal's goal is to submit an R01, as PI, during the third year of this grant.  CCHMC, one of the top three pediatric research hospitals in the nation, is committed to Dr. Beal's career development. The research environment at CCHMC and within the Division of Behavioral Medicine and Clinical Psychology, and the mentors and collaborators identified in this proposal, are well-suited to Dr. Beal's interests and research goals. Dr. Beal will be co-mentored by Dr. Jennie Noll and Dr. Robert Ammerman. Dr. Noll has extensive experience as a researcher examining the impact of child maltreatment on adolescent development, particularly around sexual risk behaviors. Dr. Ammerman is a well-established researcher with expertise in prevention and intervention programs for high-risk populations. Her advisory committee includes Dr. Melissa Jonson-Reid, an internationally recognized researcher in child welfare and the use of administrative records, Dr. John Schulenberg, developmental psychologist and authority in adolescent and young adult substance use, Dr. Jessica Kahn, expert in adolescent medicine and sexual and HIV risk behaviors, and Dr. John Pestian, leader in machine learning and its application to clinical care. These individuals have made a commitment to mentor and guide Dr. Beal in research and career development.  The objective of this research program is to fill a gap in our current understanding of which adolescents in foster care are at greatest risk for substance use and HIV while simultaneously providing a means for establishing Dr. Beal's independence as a researcher. There are two aims of this proposal. Aim 1 uses discrete time survival analyses and linked child welfare and EMR data to examine the onset and prevalence of substance use and HIV risk behaviors for youth ages 10-20 in foster care compared to matched Medicaid-eligible youth not in foster care (Foster care n=2836; 1-to-1 matched comparison from ~9585 primary care patients). Findings will provide estimates of the rates of substance use and HIV risk behaviors across ages 10-20 and when they increase/decrease, which is critical for identifying the ideal time to begin prevention and intervention efforts. Aim 2 will draw on causal inference techniques and machine learning to identify youth who are substance using or at substantial risk for developing HIV prior to age 21 based on two categories of risk factors: 1 â those common in adolescence, including parental substance use and mental health diagnoses; and 2 â risk factors unique to foster care, including extended time in foster care and placement instability. Analyses will be conducted using structural equation modeling to identify predictors of substance use and HIV risk behaviors. Machine learning will be used to develop classifiers that distinguish youth likely to use substances and contract HIV. This approach will, for the first time, provide a means to identify youth at risk for these negative health outcomes before youth experience these consequences. Via this approach, clinicians and front-line workers will be able to easily distinguish youth at risk and dedicate more time to prevention efforts. The proposed program of training and research will provide a clear pathway for Dr. Beal to transition as an independent researcher. This unique program of research merges her expertise in developmental science and health during adolescence and the transition to adulthood with research in child maltreatment, substance use, and HIV risk behaviors to support interdisciplinary, innovative team science approaches to prevent poor health outcomes among foster youth. The proposed studies in this application are significant because the findings take a developmental perspective to provide clinically useful information about which youth are at risk for poor health outcomes. Such an approach is innovative and will transform prevention delivery efforts for vulnerable foster youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Teens in foster care are at increased risk for substance abuse and contracting HIV compared to their peers, in addition to experiencing poor education, work, and psychosocial outcomes; leveraging administrative child welfare data linked to electronic medical records data for foster youth affords the opportunity to examine key factors that contribute to risk. The goal if this application is to identify youth at risk for substance abuse and HIV, with an eye toward designing intervention and prevention efforts that front-line workers and providers can enact for foster youth prior to age 18 to increase the likelihood that substance abuse and HIV in adulthood can be prevented. The concepts learned through this grant, as well as the career development pursued by the investigator, will be readily applicable to foster youth in child welfare and healthcare settings and could lead to innovations previously unachieved with this challenging and vulnerable adolescent population.",Using Administrative and Clinical Data to Detect Drug Use and HIV Risk in Foster Care,9851871,K01DA041620,"['21 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Adolescent Medicine', 'Adolescent Risk Behavior', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'Bees', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Child Welfare', 'Child health care', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Contracts', 'County', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Drug usage', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Ethics', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'HIV Infections', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Journals', 'Justice', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicaid services', 'Medical center', 'Melissa', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Occupations', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Pediatric Research', 'Phase', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Psychologist', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Services', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Substance Addiction', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Survival Analysis', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Teenagers', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Voluntary Programs', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'caregiving', 'clinical care', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'falls', 'foster care', 'health care settings', 'high risk population', 'indicated prevention', 'innovation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'intervention program', 'maltreatment', 'peer', 'prevent', 'programs', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'reproductive', 'research and development', 'sexual risk behavior', 'statistics', 'substance abuse treatment', 'success', 'symposium', 'therapy design', 'volunteer', 'vulnerable adolescent']",NIDA,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,K01,2020,165510,0.04359375393575959
"Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI) Project Summary/Abstract  Substance misuse is inconsistently addressed in routine medical practice. Primary care physicians frequently fail to diagnose substance abuse when presented with early symptoms of alcohol or drug use. Patients report that less than one-third of primary care physicians carefully screen them for substance abuse, in spite of available and effective screening protocols. Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) is an integrated, evidence-based approach aimed at delivering early intervention for drug and alcohol misuse in medical settings and has been demonstrated to reduce substance misuse. Motivational Interviewing (MI), an underlying component of SBIRT, is an evidence-based, brief interventional approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors. Unfortunately, the MI approach is very difficult to teach to practitioners as it is counterintuitive to most providers who commonly take a directive approach with patients. Because of ineffective training, MI and SBIRT are under-utilized.  The primary goal of this project is to transform MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that analyzes practitioner responses and gives immediate feedback to improve MI skills. Our team has been developing and testing a training tool that uses natural language processing (NLP) to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI). ReadMI is a low cost, ultra-portable solution for accurate and automatic real-time assessment of dialog during the course of MI training. It makes use of the latest advances in deep-learning-based speech recognition and mobile and cloud computing technologies to enable instantaneous MI training assessment and analysis. Currently functioning with 92% accuracy, ReadMI provides immediate feedback to MI and SBIRT trainees regarding the number of open- and closed-ended questions asked, provider-vs-patient conversation time, and other integral components of MI.  ReadMI will advance the skill development of physicians and other healthcare professionals in their use of MI and SBIRT, minimizing the need for time-consuming reviews of recorded training sessions. Our aims are: 1) develop ReadMI to provide MI training metrics with 95% accuracy and 2) test ReadMI in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 200 medical students and residents, 100 who will receive SBIRT/MI training with ReadMI and 100 who will serve as the control group, receiving customary SBIRT/MI training.  The prospective applications of ReadMI extend far beyond substance use disorder (SUD) prevention, detection, and intervention. The effectiveness of all chronic disease management is largely dependent on patient behavior. MI is a patient-focused conversation between the provider and the patient that reinforces the patient's motivation to make positive changes in health-related behavior. By making efficient MI training available to more health professionals, ReadMI will improve healthcare quality as providers are better equipped in their efforts to help patients make healthy lifestyle changes. Project Narrative Motivational Interviewing (MI) is an evidence-based approach that has been demonstrated to be highly effective in triggering change in high-risk lifestyle behaviors, including substance misuse. However, MI and a specific application of MI to substance misuse known as SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) are underutilized because of inadequate training of health professionals. This research aims to revolutionize MI and SBIRT training with a software-based training solution that uses natural language processing to provide Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing (ReadMI).",Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing training (ReadMI),9980343,R21HS026548,[' '],AHRQ,WRIGHT STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,118134,0.061858677570483675
"Testing Scalable, Single-Session Interventions for Adolescent Depression in the context of COVID-19 Project Summary/Abstract States and localities nationwide are taking unprecedented steps to reduce public health threats posed by COVID-19, including school closures affecting >50 million youth. The pandemic has also caused families extreme financial hardship, sudden unemployment, and distress. This combination of collective trauma, social isolation, and economic recession drastically increases risk for adolescent major depression (MD): already the lead cause of disability in youth. However, youth MD treatments face problems of potency and accessibility. Up to 65% of youth receiving MD treatment fail to respond, partly due to MDâs heterogeneity: an MD diagnosis reflects >1400 possible symptom combinations, highlighting the need for treatments matched to personal need. Treatment accessibility issues are similarly severe. Before the pandemic, <50% of youth with MD accessed any treatment at all; newfound financial strain will further preclude familiesâ capacity to afford care for their children. It is thus critical to identify effective, scalable strategies to buffer against youth MD in the context of COVID-19, along with strategies to match such interventions with youth most likely to benefit. This project will integrate machine learning approaches and large-scale SSI research to rapidly test potent, accessible strategies for reducing adolescent MD during COVID-19. Via the largest-ever SSI trial (N=1,200 youth with elevated MD symptoms, ages 12-16), Aim 1 is to test whether (1) evidence-based SSIs improve proximal targets (e.g., hopelessness and perceived agency, which has predicted longer-term SSI response) and 3- month clinical outcomes (MD severity) during the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) whether SSIs targeting cognitive versus behavioral MD symptoms are most impactful in this context. In a fully-online trial, youths recruited from across the U.S. will be randomized to 1 of 3 self-administered SSIs: a behavioral activation SSI, targeting behavioral MD symptoms (anhedonia; activity withdrawal); an SSI teaching growth mindset, the belief that personal traits are malleable, targeting cognitive MD symptoms (e.g. hopelessness); or a control SSI. Per baseline, post-SSI, and 3-month follow-up data, we will test each SSIâs relative benefits, versus the control, in the context of COVID-19. Results will reveal whether SSIs targeting behavioral versus cognitive symptoms differentially reduce overall MD severity in this context. Aim 2 is to test whether (and, if so, which of) SSIs can impact COVID-19 specific trauma and anxiety symptoms, informing whether novel, COVID-19-tailored supports may be needed to reduce pandemic-specific mental health sequelae. Aim 3 is to test person-level and contextual predictors of SSI response, via machine-learning techniques, regardless of overall intervention effects observed. Given MDâs heterogeneity, we will test whether baseline symptoms (e.g., having more severe cognitive or behavioral MD symptoms) predict response to SSIs targeting different symptom types. We will also test exposure to COVID-19-related adversities (e.g. parent job loss; loved one hospitalized for COVID-19) and general disadvantage (e.g. family low-income; racial minority status) forecast SSI response. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to integrate machine learning approaches and large-scale single-session intervention (SSI) research to rapidly test potent, accessible strategies for reducing depression in adolescents in the context of COVID-19. Via the largest-ever SSI trial (N=1200 adolescents), goals are to test whether evidence- based SSIs improve proximal targets (hopelessness, perceived agency, anhedonia) and clinical outcomes 3 months later (depression symptoms and COVID-19-related anxiety and trauma) in adolescents experiencing depression; whether SSIs targeting cognitive versus behavioral depression symptoms produce more favorable outcomes, versus an active control; and whether individual profiles of symptoms or COVID-19-related adversity exposure predicts individual-level SSI response. Results may identify novel, immediately actionable strategies to matching adolescents to targeted SSIs based on personal needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Testing Scalable, Single-Session Interventions for Adolescent Depression in the context of COVID-19",10164526,DP5OD028123,"['Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anhedonia', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Buffers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disadvantaged', 'Distress', 'Dropout', 'Economic Recession', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Financial Hardship', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intervention Trial', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Health Services', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Self Administration', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Social isolation', 'Students', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Unemployment', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'Youth', 'active control', 'anxiety symptoms', 'base', 'child depression', 'depressive symptoms', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intervention effect', 'loved ones', 'lower income families', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'predicting response', 'premature', 'psychosocial', 'racial minority', 'recruit', 'response', 'social media', 'therapy design', 'trait', 'trauma symptom', 'treatment trial', 'virtual']",OD,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,DP5,2020,392813,0.03475421809307812
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 âCenter of Excellenceâ. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices.

"Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing Millions of Americans receive evidence-based counseling for substance use problems each year. Many evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are âtalk basedâ therapies, such as motivational interviewing (MI), but the existing research-based methodology for evaluating counseling quality is to record sessions and use human rating teams to evaluate them. However, using humans as the assessment tool via behavioral coding is prohibitive in cost and time, can be error prone, and is virtually never used in the real world. Technology is needed that can analyze the speech patterns and spoken language of counseling sessions, provide automatic and intuitive quality scores, and summarize these in actionable feedback. Rapid, performance-based quality metrics could support training, ongoing supervision, and quality assurance for millions of evidence-based counseling sessions for substance abuse each year. Lyssn.io is a start-up targeting the development of implementation-focused technology to support evidence-based counseling. Our goal is to develop innovative health technology solutions that are objective, scalable, and cost efficient. Lyssn.io includes expertise in speech signal processing, machine learning, user-centered design, software engineering, and clinical expertise in evidence-based counseling. Previous NIH-funded research laid a computational foundation for generating MI quality metrics from speech and language features in MI sessions, and led to a prototype of a clinical software support tool, the Counselor Observer Ratings Expert for MI (CORE-MI). The current Fast-Track SBIR proposal includes Phase I, which will focus on understanding clinical workflows, assessing usability, and initial validation of machine learning of MI fidelity measures in the opioid treatment program at Evergreen Treatment Services (ETS) clinic in Seattle, WA. Phase II will focus on robust validation of the speech and language technologies underlying the CORE-MI tool, and development of scalable supervision protocols that integrate CORE-MI supported feedback for counselors. Finally, we will conduct a quasi-experimental evaluation of CORE-MI supported supervision and training at a second ETS clinic in the Puget Sound, focusing on acceptability, usability, and adoption, the impact on supervision, improved MI fidelity and preliminary evidence of increased client retention. The successful execution of this project will break the reliance on human judgment for providing performance-based feedback to MI and will massively expand the capacity to train, supervise, and provide quality assurance in MI for substance abuse. Most evidence-based treatments for substance abuse are in-person psychotherapy and counseling interventions, such as motivational interviewing. There are currently no methods for evaluating the quality of such counseling interventions in the real world to support training, supervision, and quality assurance. Building on an existing prototype, Lyssn.io â a technology start-up focused on scalable and cost-efficient human-centered technologies â will enhance and evaluate a cloud-based, HIPAA-compliant clinical support software tool that uses automated speech recognition and machine learning in an community based opioid replacement clinic.","Technology-supported, measurement-based supervision for Motivational Interviewing",9847959,R44DA046243,"['Adherence', 'Administrator', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Client', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Counseling', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'E-learning', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence based treatment', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act', 'Health Technology', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Needs Assessment', 'Online Systems', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Professional counselor', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Psychology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Speech', 'Stream', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Suicide', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Support', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'automated speech recognition', 'automobile accident', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cloud based', 'community setting', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'dashboard', 'design', 'encryption', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'gun homicide', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'innovation', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'novel', 'opioid abuse', 'opioid treatment program', 'overdose death', 'prediction algorithm', 'protocol development', 'prototype', 'quality assurance', 'research and development', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'sound', 'speech processing', 'substance abuse treatment', 'support tools', 'technological innovation', 'tool', 'tool development', 'treatment services', 'usability', 'user centered design', 'virtual', 'visual feedback']",NIDA,"LYSSN.IO, INC.",R44,2020,394059,-0.013446660528365736
"Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Clinical Trials Network Project Summary/Abstract  This proposal is a competing renewal application of the Northeast Node of the National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN), which joined the CTN in 2015. The Northeast Node brought hundreds of community and healthcare partners across the states of New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine to the CTN community for the first time. These states have among the very highest rates of substance use in the U.S., including opioid use, and they include some of the most rural communities in the U.S. The Node has brought significant expertise to the CTN in conducting practical, rigorous, innovative, and highly impactful trials focused on improving the treatment of substance use disorders (SUDs) in community systems in the Northeast and in partnership with other CTN Nodes across the nation. Node Investigators have extensive experience in leading national and multi-national clinical trials, digital technology; medication and behavioral treatments for opioid use disorder; co-occurring SUDs and mental health disorders; SUD and chronic pain; SUD in pregnant women; opioid, cannabis, tobacco, alcohol, stimulant, and polydrug treatment; SUD prevention and treatment among youth; and implementation science. The Northeast Node is embedded within the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health (CTBH), a NIDA-funded P30 âCenter of Excellenceâ. The Node thus brings significant expertise in developing, evaluating, and implementing digital treatments for SUDs, with a focus on overcoming the striking disparities in treatment access and treatment quality evident in healthcare across the globe.  In the renewal period, the Node proposes to enhance its activities and contributions to the national CTN to embrace advances in scientific discovery and research innovations that offer great promise for increasing the reach and effectiveness of treatments for SUDs. The Node will engage a broader group of investigators that bring additional expertise in data science (bioinformatics, predictive modeling, artificial intelligence, social media, data privacy/security) and experimental design (micro-randomized trials, adaptive designs, and implementation/systems science). With this expanded group of partners, it will support and grow a productive research agenda in the CTN with a focus on (a) digital health and data analytics, including research focused on providing personalized, science-based resources to individuals with SUD via digital technology and (b) expanding low threshold access to science-based SUD care, particularly in rural contexts (e.g., general medical settings; pharmacies; and community organizations). And the Node will lead an expansion of CTN research on the (c) rapidly evolving landscape of cannabis use as well as (d) co-morbid SUD and mental health disorders. The Node will establish Community and Policy Advisory Boards to complement the existing communication infrastructure between Node investigators and their partners, with a focus on identifying the most significant and timely SUD needs in our communities and scaling-up and sustaining best practices.

"Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use Project Summary/Abstract  Insufficient knowledge of brain-based risk factors for problem cannabis use is a key barrier to identifying individuals at risk for cannabis-related harm and designing targeted prevention and early intervention approaches to promote positive development for persons at risk. The current proposal combines multiple, large- scale, neuroimaging datasets with novel densely-sampled fMRI data to identify a neuromarker of problem cannabis use and characterize its development prior to cannabis use onset, and in the context of current cannabis use in adolescence. We will apply a whole-brain, machine-learning method â connectome-based predictive modeling â to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use in a large sample of college students (Brain and Alcohol Research in College Students study; BARCS), and compare this network to canonical neural networks previously implicated in risk for cannabis use: frontoparietal, salience, and default mode networks. We will then examine the developmental trajectory of these cannabis risk networks in relation to other known risk factors for addiction prior to cannabis use onset in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) dataset, a nationally-representative sample of 11,875 children. We will examine whether individuals at high-risk for substance use problems (family history of substance use and exposure to early adversity) display a delay in the typical trajectory of network stabilization within cannabis risk networks. Finally, we will collect densely-sampled fMRI data (4 scans in 6 months) from 20 adolescents (age 15-17) who regularly use cannabis and 20 age- and sex-matched typically-developing adolescents. This study design will enable us to examine cannabis effects on short-term neural network dynamics and evaluate whether cannabis using adolescents are characterized by reduced stability of cannabis risk networks relative to their typically-developing peers. By combining multiple existing large-scale neuroimaging datasets with original, longitudinal, densely- sampled fMRI data, the proposed study design offers a unique opportunity to examine the interplay between neural mechanisms of risk for problem use and cannabis exposure effects on the developing adolescent brain and promises to yield important insights into the neural mechanisms of risk for problem cannabis use that can foster novel prevention and intervention initiatives to mitigate cannabis-related harms for individuals at high risk.  The current proposal also aims to provide Dr. Sarah Lichenstein with expert mentorship by Drs. Pearlson, Casey, Yip, Scheinost and Stevens to build the skills necessary to develop into an independent clinical scientist applying multimodal neuroimaging methods to study the pathophysiology of addiction. Dr. Lichenstein will pursue specialized training in studying cannabis effects on brain and behavior, big data science, and the conduct of research with adolescent participants. Furthermore, the collection of novel, densely-sampled, adolescent fMRI data will also provide Dr. Lichenstein with a rich and unique pilot dataset to support the submission of a R01 application by the end of the award period and facilitate her transition to an independent investigator. Project Narrative Cannabis use is extremely common and associated with clinically-significant negative outcomes for a subset of users, yet it is not currently possible to predict who is at highest risk for cannabis-related harms at the individual level. The current proposal aims to identify a neural network predictive of problem cannabis use, and to characterize the development of this network both before and after cannabis use onset. Elucidating the neural basis of problem cannabis use will facilitate the development of novel prevention and early intervention efforts to mitigate potential cannabis-related harms for individuals at highest risk.",Connectome-based neuromarkers of problem cannabis use,10038977,K08DA051667,"['18 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Cannabis', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Fostering', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Play', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Specificity', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'alcohol research', 'base', 'big-data science', 'brain behavior', 'brain research', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive development', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'design', 'early life adversity', 'endogenous cannabinoid system', 'high risk', 'illicit drug use', 'improved', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'marijuana legalization', 'marijuana use', 'multimodality', 'neural network', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'peer', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'skills', 'university student']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,191700,0.05652476682616967
"SCH: ChangeGradients: Promoting Adolescent Health Behavior Change with Clinically Integrated Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient Methods Because the majority of adolescent health problems are amenable to behavioral intervention and most adolescents visit a healthcare provider once a year, hea lth behavior change interventions linked to clinic- based health information technologies hold significant promise for improving healthcare quality and subsequent behavioral health outcomes for adolescents. Recognizing the potential to leverage advances in machine learning and virtual narrative environments, the field of health behavior change is now well- positioned to design health behavior change systems that extend the reach of clinicians to realize significant impacts on behavior change for adolescent preventive health. With a focus on risky behaviors and an emphasis on alcohol use, the project has two specific aims: (1) design, develop, and iteratively refine a policy-based reinforcement learning behavior change system for preventive adolescent health, and (2) investigate the impact of a clinically integrated sample-efficient policy gradient-based behavior change system on adolescent behavior. The project w ill culminate w ith an investigation of the behavioral effects of the CHANGEGRADIENTS system using adolescent patients recruited from two outpatient primary care clinics within the UCSF Department of Pediatrics: Mt. Zion Pediatrics and the Adolescent/Young Adult Clinic. It is hypothesized that adolescents who interact with CHANGEGRADIENTS with reduce number of days of alcohol use, reduce binge drinking, and increase self-efficacy to engage in healthy behavior a nd avoid risky substance use. It is anticipated that CHANGEGRADIENTS will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and serve as the foundation for next-generation personalized preventive healthcare through computationally-enabled behavior change that is designed to be tightly integrated into clinical practice workflow. By taking advantage of the high degree of adaptive interactivity offered by its personalized behavior change environment, CHANGEGRADIENTS holds significant potential for creating compelling interactions that promote self-efficacy and engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to prevent cancer through improving cancer-related behaviors and risk factors.  REL EVAN CE (Se e in stru cti ons): The proposed research will develop and field test an innovative computationally-enabled personalized behavior change model that will provide a testbed for a broad range of health behavior change research and is designed to be integrated into clinical practice.

"Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minorities (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) are at increased risk for numerous adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, suicidality, substance use, HIV/AIDS, asthma, cardiovascular disease, and certain forms of cancer. Despite clear documentation and replication of these health disparities, relatively little is known about their development from adolescence into adulthood. Two theories primarily dominate the literature. Minority stress models describe unique life stressors experienced only by sexual minorities (e.g., victimization and discrimination based on sexual orientation) as primary contributors to health disparities. Other models implicate both minority stress and normative psychosocial processes together as contributors to health disparities. Some such normative processes include (1) psychological adjustment and characteristics (e.g., emotion regulation/dysregulation, substance use expectancies), (2) disrupted social systems (e.g., family, peers, school), and (3) individual differences (e.g., race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, temperament). To date, most studies of both minority stress and normative processes are limited by use of cross-sectional samples of primarily Caucasian adults. Although much has been learned from these studies, they do not permit analysis of emerging health disparities across development. Existing research is therefore limited in terms of both generalizability to diverse populations, and validity of directionality inferences between observed âpredictorsâ and âoutcomesâ. My long-term career goals are to identify mechanisms leading to disparities among sexual minorities, with the goal of improving treatments for these disparities, and to develop screening tools to identify high-risk youth who would benefit from prevention programs. To reach this goal, in this project, I address existing limitations to the literature using a prospective sample of individuals who were 14-19 years old at baseline and followed for over 4 years. My goal is to describe developmental trajectories and mechanisms of health disparity development for sexual minority youth compared with heterosexual youth across a 10-year developmental window spanning ages 14- 23 years. Longitudinal outcomes include depression/anxiety, suicidality, delinquency, sleep, general physical health, disordered eating and substance use. Developmental trajectories for these outcomes will be charted by gender and sexual orientation. Confirmatory analyses based on existing literature will be conducted to examine relations between minority stress and adverse outcomes. Then, I will use machine learning to identify as-yet unknown predictors of adverse outcomes and health disparities and characterize any changes in prediction across time. Finally, I will use state-of-the art intervening variable analyses (mediation, moderation) to evaluate longitudinal mechanisms through which health disparities emerge. Findings should provide insight into mechanisms of disparity development and maintenance, informing prevention and intervention strategies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority youth (lesbian, gay, bisexual and other non-heterosexual individuals) experience wide-ranging disparities in mental and physical health that often persist into adulthood, yet little is known about development of these disparities. This research (1) examines developmental trajectories in mental and physical health outcomes from adolescence to young adulthood among sexual minority and matched heterosexual youth, (2) uses advanced statistical methods (e.g., machine learning) to identify hypothesized and currently unknown factors that predict disparities over time, and (3) elucidates pathways to adversity and resilience. Experiences of sexual minority and heterosexual youth and young adults will be compared to uncover possible differences in developmental experiences that lead to health disparities, with possible implications for prevention and intervention among a highly vulnerable population.",Predicting adverse outcomes among sexual minorities and heterosexuals from a prospective study of adolescent health and wellbeing,9929425,F31MD014052,"['19 year old', 'AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Asthma', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Caucasians', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Depression and Suicide', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Documentation', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Expectancy', 'Family', 'Feeling hopeless', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterosexuals', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Lesbian Gay Bisexual', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal prospective study', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Ohio', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Prevention program', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological adjustment', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Factor', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Sex Orientation', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spirituality', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Victimization', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Youth', 'adolescent health', 'adverse outcome', 'age group', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'career', 'emerging adult', 'emotion dysregulation', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'multilevel analysis', 'non-heterosexual', 'outcome prediction', 'peer', 'peer influence', 'peer victimization', 'physical conditioning', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychosocial', 'racial diversity', 'racial minority', 'resilience', 'sexual identity', 'sexual minority', 'sexual risk behavior', 'social', 'social factors', 'stressor', 'substance misuse', 'theories', 'treatment disparity', 'young adult']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,33937,0.023544219530733667
"From Manic Symptoms to Bipolar Disorder: Neural-behavioral Markers Using Two Analytic Models PROJECT SUMMARY Bipolar disorder (BD) is a devastating neuropsychiatric illness that affects 2-5% of youth and causes morbidity, functional impairment, and suicide. Prodromal manic symptoms without manic episodes usually emerge before BD types I and II (BD-I/II) develop, but less than 60% of youth with manic symptoms will develop BD-I/II. The uncertainty of diagnosis and illness progression results in potentially detrimental interventions and 7-10 years delay appropriate treatments. It is thus imperative that objective biomarkers of risk for conversion to BD-I/II are identified and tested in youth before the peak onset of illness. Given that neural measures of structure and function associated with emotion and reward processing, in combination with clinical and behavior measures, can improve prediction of psychiatric outcomes in youth, this project will investigate brain-behavior relations in the most severely ill youth during inpatient stays and aims to build a predictive model of BD. We aim to use two distinct analytic models to test our hypotheses. First a general linear model (GLM) with a machine learning (ML) model of regularized regression with cross validation and second a whole brain ML pattern recognition model. We will first identify neural and behavioral markers of BD-I/II in circuitry associated with emotion and reward processing. We hypothesize that decreased activity and connectivity in prefrontal, amygdala, and striatal regions and behavioral measures showing less sleep, lower activity, and poorer mood and cognition will distinguish BD- I/II from clinically matched youth without mania and healthy. Next, we will identify using ML a whole brain neural classifier of BD-I/II relative to clinically matched inpatients without mania. Aim 2 is to, after two years, identify and quantify the neural and behavioral measures that predict conversion to BD-I/II, and to test individual conversion in an independent group of high symptomatic risk adolescents. Aim 3 is to identify brain-behavior associations for app development. Training samples include mid-/post- pubertal adolescents aged 13-17 years recruited from the nationâs only specialized inpatient unit for adolescents with BD and the general adolescent unit at our hospital; 70 well-characterized adolescents with BD-I/II, a clinically matched group of 70 inpatient youth without mania. Testing sample is an independent group of 180 adolescents with manic symptoms without BD-I/II. 60 healthy controls will be recruited. The project includes emotion and reward processing neural function and structure, clinical and behavioral measures including sleep and activity with actigraphy, computerized cognitive measures, and self-reports during inpatient evaluation and for two weeks post discharge. At two-year follow up, clinical assessments will confirm diagnoses. This is the first study to employ a multimodal assessment of behavior and mood symptoms combined with multimodal imaging methods to comprehensively assess disease-specific abnormalities and prediction of BD-I/II. Findings from this study may identify biological and behavioral markers of conversion to BD-I/II in adolescents and may contribute developing disease-specific risk calculators, low-cost biosensors for mobile applications, and novel targets of intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Adolescents may experience manic symptoms that may or may not progress into bipolar disorder. This proposed longitudinal study would be the first of its kind and could shed light on the neural and behavioral markers of disease progression in high-risk adolescents with manic symptoms.

The President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis and others have suggested that telemedicine for substance use disorder (âtele- SUDâ) may be part of the solution. In preliminary analyses, we have found that tele-SUD use is growing rapidly, and there is widespread policy interest in Congress and state legislatures in how to accelerate this growth. The SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, signed into law in October 2018, includes several provisions intended to reduce barriers to tele-SUD use and will likely increase the availability of and reimbursement for tele-SUD.

"Health Quest: Engaging Adolescents in Health Careers with Technology-Rich Personalized Learning Project Summary/Abstract Engaging adolescents' interest in pursuing careers in health science and the health professions offers significant promise for building our nation's healthcare and health research capacity. The goal of this project is to create Health Quest, an intelligent game-based learning environment that increases adolescents' knowledge of, interest in, and self-efficacy to pursue health science careers. Three specific aims will be accomplished by the project: 1. Design and develop Health Quest to engage adolescents' interest in the health sciences utilizing  personalized learning technologies that integrate the following components: (a) the Health Quest Career  Adventure Game, an intelligent game-based learning environment that leverages AI technologies to  create personalized health career adventures; (b) the Health Quest Student Discovery website, which  will feature interactive video interviews with health professionals about their biomedical, behavioral, and  clinical research careers; and (c) the Health Quest Teacher Resource Center website, which will provide  online professional development materials and in-class support for teachers' classroom implementation of  Health Quest. 2. Investigate the impact of Health Quest on adolescents' (1) knowledge of biomedical, behavioral, and  clinical research careers; (2) interest in biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research careers; and (3) self-  efficacy for pursuing biomedical, behavioral, and clinical research careers by conducting a matched  comparison study in middle school classes. ! 3. Examine the effect of Health Quest on diverse adolescents by gender and racial/ethnicity.

"Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Summary/Abstract Missing outcome data threaten the validity of randomized clinical trials because inference about treatment effects then necessarily relies on untestable assumptions, which wrongly stated can lead to incorrect conclusions. While it is widely recognized that evaluating the sensitivity of trial results to assumptions about the missing data mech- anism should be a mandatory component of reporting, rigorous sensitivity analyses are not routinely reported. Likely explanations include inadequate knowledge translation by statistical methodologists to both principal in- vestigators and their statistical collaborators as well as lack of software. Substance use disorder clinical trials are known to suffer from high rates of missing data. Unlike regulatory trials where missing data are primarily the result of premature study withdrawal, individuals in substance use disorder trials tend to intermittently skip their scheduled outcome assessments. This produces an explosion of ânon-monotoneâ missing data patterns that makes sensitivity analysis methodologically and computationally chal- lenging. There has been relatively little research on sensitivity analysis procedures for analyzing such data and the procedures that have been developed are anchored to assumptions that are problematic. Thus, investigators are faced with challenging analytic barriers and the conclusions they draw from their trials may be ï¬awed. In this three-year proposal, we will reanalyze 29 clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network (CTN), and made publicly available on NIDA's DataShare website, to evaluate their robustness to missing data assump- tions through rigorous sensitivity analysis. Since adequate tools for conducting sensitivity analysis of studies with highly non-monotone missing data patterns do not yet exist, we plan to develop, implement and dissemi- nate (through journal articles, short courses and webinars) an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software to evaluate the robustness, to missing data assumptions, of trials in which binary outcomes (e.g., substance use) are scheduled to be repeatedly collected at ï¬xed points in time after ran- domization and participants intermittently skip their scheduled assessments. Our tool will be developed by an interdisciplinary team of biostatisticians and substance use disorder treatment experts, with input from an advi- sory board comprised of highly regarded statistical experts and leading scientists in the substance use disorder community. Through reanalysis of the NIDA's CTN trials using our tool, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions. Additionally, demonstrat- ing the importance and utility of our tool to our advisory board and to the substance use disorder community more broadly stands to increase the likelihood of adoption. Finally, the development, testing, and dissemination of this innovative statistical tool can serve as a template for other scientiï¬c domains, making âstress-testingâ to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine component of scientiï¬c reporting. Program Director/Principal Investigator (Last, First, Middle): Scharfstein, Daniel, Oscar Project Narrative We will develop, implement and disseminate an innovative sensitivity analysis methodology and open-source, user-friendly software tool to evaluate the robustness to missing data assumptions of clinical trials in which binary outcomes are collected at ï¬xed points over time but where participants intermittently miss their scheduled assess- ments, as frequently occurs in addiction research. We will utilize this tool to reanalyze data from 29 substance abuse clinical trials conducted by NIDA's Clinical Trials Network and available publicly on NIDA's DataShare web- site. As a result, we will be better able to understand the impact of missing data assumptions on the evaluation of the studied interventions and, by demonstrating the importance and utility of our tool to an advisory board comprised of study investigators and to the substance use disorder community more broadly, we aim to make âstress-testingâ to untestable missing data assumptions a more routine part of scientiï¬c reporting.",Missing Data Matters: Substance Use Disorder Clinical Trials,9923614,R01DA046534,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Network', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Explosion', 'Future', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'HIV risk', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Individual', 'Intervention Studies', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Outcome Measure', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stress Tests', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Withdrawal', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'clinical trial analysis', 'data sharing', 'flexibility', 'innovation', 'interest', 'journal article', 'knowledge translation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'secondary analysis', 'simulation', 'software development', 'study characteristics', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'web site', 'webinar']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,100287,0.10547693717905207
"Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY  This proposal responds to RFA-MH-17-612, âPilot Effectiveness Trials for Treatment, Preventive and Services Interventions (R34).â We have shown in several randomized trials that family-focused therapy (FFT) for symptomatic youth at high-risk for bipolar disorder - consisting of psychoeducation and family communication and problem solving skills training - is an effective adjunct to pharmacotherapy in hastening symptomatic recovery. However, between 50%-60% of high-risk youth still have residual mood symptoms and functional impairment after 18 weeks of FFT. In our prior studies, two constructs have emerged as predictors of lack of response to treatment: mood instability in the child and expressed emotion (EE) in parents (i.e., frequent critical comments or hostility). In adolescents (ages 12-18) with a parent with bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder, we hypothesize that augmenting FFT with frequent and targeted interventions in the home setting through a Smartphone app (MyCoachConnect, or MCC) will (a) have a greater and more rapid impact than standard FFT on the targeted mechanisms of mood instability in adolescents and EE in parents, and (b) as a result, enhance symptom resolution and functioning in adolescents. To be eligible, adolescents must score high on parent-rated measures of mood instability, and have at least one parent who is high-EE by speech sample coding criteria. The MCC app will record weekly open speech samples from parents and children and daily and weekly mood ratings from adolescents. The app assessments will be fed back to the FFT clinician, who will use this information to âpushâ recommendations for mood regulation, communication, and problem-solving strategies (linked to the FFT modules) for parents and youth. In year 1, we will conduct an open trial (n=25) to determine (a) the feasibility and acceptability of FFT with mobile coaching (FFT-MCC), as given by clinicians in community settings, and (b) associations between online/speech feature proxies of the targets (mood instability and EE as measured weekly by MCC) and standard measures of the targets. In years 2 and 3 we will conduct a 75- case RCT in which families are assigned to FFT with MCC skills coaching, FFT with MCC assessments only, with no coaching; or FFT Only, without MCC. We hypothesize that FFT-MCC will be acceptable to parents, adolescents and clinicians, and more effective than FFT without MCC coaching or FFT-Only in engaging the targets of mood instability and EE and promoting improvements in adolescents' mood symptoms and quality of life over 27 weeks. The study will facilitate the translation of a technological augmentation to an evidence-based family intervention, with the goal of increasing treatment access among families with mood disorders. Project Narrative/Relevance We propose to enhance the scalability of family-focused therapy (FFT), a 12-session evidence- based therapy for youth at high risk for mood disorders, through augmentation with a novel mobile phone application called MyCoachConnect (MCC). In adolescents with mood instability who have a parent with bipolar or major depressive disorder, clinicians in community clinics will conduct FFT sessions (consisting of psychoeducation and family skills training) supplemented by weekly MCC âreal timeâ assessments of moods and family relationships; based on results of these assessments and the family's progress in treatment, clinicians will then push personalized informational and coaching alerts regarding the practice of communication and problem-solving skills. We hypothesize that the augmented version of FFT (FFT-MCC) will be more effective than FFT without coaching/informational alerts in altering treatment targets and in stabilizing youths' mood symptoms and quality of life.",Technology-Enhanced Family-Focused Treatment for Adolescents at High Risk for Mood Disorders,9940913,R34MH117200,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Anxiety', 'Back', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Code', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Dimensions', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotional', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Expressed Emotion', 'Family', 'Family Relationship', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Home environment', 'Hostility', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Manic', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phase', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem Solving', 'Protocols documentation', 'Provider', 'Proxy', 'Published Comment', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Readiness', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Sleep', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Voice', 'Youth', 'base', 'boys', 'community clinic', 'community setting', 'effectiveness trial', 'emerging adult', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'girls', 'high risk', 'hypomania', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'mobile application', 'mood regulation', 'mood symptom', 'novel', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'psychoeducation', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'service intervention', 'skills', 'skills training', 'smartphone Application', 'standard measure', 'symptomatic improvement', 'therapy design', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'usability', 'volunteer']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R34,2020,273000,0.0584143554643116
"Leveraging Social Media for Substance Use Behavioral Insight  Project Summary Substance misuse places a tremendous burden on individuals and society and remains high because so many youth initiate substance use at an early age and progress to dependence. In one of my NIDA sponsored R01s, I am funded to examine the effects of school and state-level penalties on youth substance use behaviors while accounting for anti-tobacco/drug media campaigns (R01 DA032843). My research signals a health issue of increasing importance that is youth exposure to the promotion of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug-related content via advertisements, online social networking, and other normalizing and pro-use messages. There is potential for leveraging social media as a tool to understand, inform, and potentially dissuade harmful substance use behaviors. However, a critical and necessary first step is to better understand displayed substance use references on key social media sites and how these displays are associated with use. In my second NIDA-sponsored R01, I am funded to investigate the implications of social media content and engagement for alcohol and marijuana use (R01 DA039456). I am a newly tenured investigator who has already made important contributions to the study of substance use policy and social media research. I will investigate social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity. I also aim to generate a strong scientific base about social media as a potential medium for delivering anti-/pro- substance use messages to young people. At this juncture, it is critical for me to receive support from this Independent Scientist Award so that I can devote all of my efforts towards continuing to build my research program and to enhance my scientific skills and advance me to the next level of achievement. I will collaborate with investigators at Washington University and nationally in order to gain further experience in sophisticated and efficient data mining analysis. I will additionally achieve an improved ability to synthesize results across multiple studies into strategic and actionable recommendations for tailored prevention messages to deliver on social media. This award will also enable me to devote a substantial amount of time to mentorship and the development of the next generation of researchers. In summary, this Independent Scientist Award will enable me to expand my knowledge base in targeted areas to significantly enhance my research trajectory in ways that would not be otherwise feasible. Project Narrative This study is significant to the public health field because it will harness social media posts for novel insight into drug use, especially newly emerging drugs that are increasing in popularity.

"ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center Project Summary/Abstract In its initial funding period, the ABCD consortium used a rigorous epidemiological approach to recruit a diverse sample of 11,878 9-10-year-olds through our 21 research sites, of which 2136 are twins or triplets. ABCD has created a comprehensive yet efficient protocol for participating youth and parents, using standardized and state-of-the-art methods for neuroimaging, biospecimens, and assessments of substance use, mental and physical health, neurocognition, culture, and environment, using a fully digital platform and making use of mobile technologies. We ensure cohesion and standardization by having employed a recruitment strategy designed by a professional survey company (experience with Monitoring the Future); standardized environmental, neurocognitive and mental health assessments, MRI assessments with all scanners using harmonized Human Connectome Project procedures, and computerized data collection with real-time quality control. Developmentally tailored assessments will have stable sensitivity and construct validity across the childhood and adolescent developmental period. They minimize participant burden, yet capture even subtle changes over time in substance use, mental health, neurocognition, development, and environment, and we employ novel state-of-the-art bioassays and passive data collection from mobile devices. A detailed retention plan builds on the experience and success of our investigators. This application describes the ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC), which will: maintain and update the harmonized MRI acquisition protocol, compatible with all major scanner platforms, taking advantage of recent technological advances in structural and functional MRI; perform rigorous quality control and quantitative calibration procedures to ensure accuracy and comparability of derived imaging measures across scanners and across time; implement advanced computational analysis workflows for all imaging data; implement reliable data entry, quality control, and monitoring tools for the substance use questionnaire, neurocognitive assessments, bioassay- derived measures, and mobile technologies assessment data; implement the state-of-the-art statistical analysis tools and procedures needed to integrate information across measures and modalities; continue development of infrastructure and procedures for public sharing of raw and derived data and associated tools and computational workflows; and enable interactive data exploration and analytics through a web-based Portal. PROJECT NARRATIVE The ABCD Consortium will use multimodal brain imaging, cognitive and clinical assessments, bioassays, mobile monitoring, and careful assessment of substance use, environment, psychopathological symptoms, and social functioning in 11,878 adolescents followed over 10 years to determine the effects of substance use on adolescent brain and cognitive development. Our ABCD Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center (DAIRC) will maintain and update harmonized MRI protocols across sites and scanners, perform quality control of raw and derived data, and implement the informatics and computational infrastructure needed for the overall project.","ABCD-USA Consortium: Data Analysis, Informatics and Resource Center",9981957,U24DA041123,"['10 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Athletic Injuries', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caffeine', 'Calibration', 'Childhood', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic study', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Dissemination', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurocognition', 'Neurocognitive', 'Nicotine', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality Control', 'Questionnaires', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Social Functioning', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Technology Assessment', 'Time', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Update', 'Youth', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive testing', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'computer infrastructure', 'computerized', 'connectome', 'data archive', 'data dissemination', 'data exploration', 'data quality', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'gene interaction', 'handheld mobile device', 'health assessment', 'high standard', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'infrastructure development', 'mobile computing', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'physical conditioning', 'recruit', 'retention rate', 'success', 'tool', 'tv watching', 'web portal']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U24,2020,1020000,0.0963703597409767
