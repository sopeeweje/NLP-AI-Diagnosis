"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques. We propose leveraging state of the art deep learning models built using data from hospitals and insurers to both predict which pregnancies will result in preterm birth and to predict which preterm infants will experience severe cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.",Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning,9928552,K01HL141771,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Accounting', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Boston', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cardiac', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Graduate Degree', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Human Pathology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Outcome', 'Patent Ductus Arteriosus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Premature Labor', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'education planning', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'peer', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'social', 'statistics']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2019,166320,0.02171086209121157
"Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome Project Summary/Abstract The high risk of neurodevelopmental impairments is a major concern for parents and clinicians caring for premature babies. Annually, approximately 22,000 very preterm infants (i.e. ≤32 weeks gestational age) in the United States develop cognitive deficits. Efforts to target interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental sequelae are hampered by our current inability to diagnose disabilities before the age of 3 to 5 years. Research supports the notion that cognitive deficits may result from a perturbation of neural connection and communication. Recent brain connectome studies in adults and older children show that abnormal network properties are useful as prognostic biomarkers. Many of these studies have exploited machine learning models based on brain connectome data for the prediction of a variety of neurological conditions, however this progress has not been fully extended to the preterm population. Our preliminary studies suggest that early and accurate prediction of cognitive deficits at an individual level is possible using machine learning models based on brain connectome features at term corrected age (CA). We have correctly classified 91.3% of very preterm infants at high risk of cognitive deficits with 90% specificity and 92.3% sensitivity. Our overall objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that can analyze integrated structural and functional brain connectome data obtained at term CA to make a prediction of later cognitive deficits in very preterm infants. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning techniques analyzing integrated structural and functional brain connectome features at birth can predict cognitive deficits at 2 years CA at an individual level in very preterm infants with accuracy of greater than 90%, exceeding the performance of current classical multivariate analyses. The two specific aims to test the central hypothesis are: 1) Develop and implement a machine learning model to extract high-level brain connectome features and 2) Develop and validate a machine learning framework to predict cognitive deficits. On completion of the first aim, we will explicate the brain connectome, and extract high-dimensional connectome features that best represent the brain connectome. In the second aim, the machine learning model we proposed will be applied in predicting both cognitive deficit (i.e. 2-class classification) and cognitive scores on a continuous scale (i.e., regression) at 2 years CA. To quantify the model's discrimination, we will also validate its performance in data that are not used for the model development, and compare with the current conventional multivariate approach. The proposed research is significant because it will increase scientific knowledge about the developing brain connectome in very preterm infants and facilitate earlier identification of babies at high risk of neurodevelopmental deficits, allowing timely clinical interventions for optimal cognitive outcome. Project Narrative Babies born before 32 weeks' gestational age are at a very high risk of developing cognitive deficits, which may impact their brain function in many ways, including life-long learning difficulties. Fortunately, infant brains are highly malleable, so it is important to identify those at highest risk as early as possible to allow effective early interventions. We propose to apply a reliable, accurate and sensitive artificial intelligence approach based on state-of-the-art brain MRI to allow identification of babies at highest risk of learning difficulties.",Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome,9759972,R21HD094085,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Premature Infant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'disability', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'interest', 'life-long learning', 'medical complication', 'model development', 'neonate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2019,238500,0.04625621353203687
"Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this R01 project is to develop an automated assessment system that can capitalize on state of the art sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable accurate and early detection of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities. In the USA, 1 in 10 infants are born at risk for these disabilities. For children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, early treatment in the first year of life improves long-term outcomes. However, we are currently held back by inadequacies of available clinical tests to measure and predict impairment. Existing tests are hard to administer, require specialized training, and have limited long- term predictive value. There is a critical need to develop an objective, accurate, easy-to-use tool for the early prediction of long-term physical disability. The field of pediatrics and infant development would greatly benefit from a quantitative score that would correlate with existing clinical measures used today to detect movement impairments in very young infants. To realize a new generation of tests that will be easy to administer, we will obtain large datasets of infants playing in an instrumented gym or simply being recorded while moving in a supine posture. Video and sensor data analyses will convert movement into feature vectors based on our knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach will use machine learning to relate these feature vectors to currently recommended clinical tests or other ground truth information. The power of this design is that algorithms can utilize many aspects of movement to produce the relevant scores. Our preliminary data allows us to lay the following aims: 1)Aim 1: To assess concurrent validity of a multimodal instrumented gym with existing clinical tools. Here, using 150 infants (75 with early brain injury and 75 controls), we will focus on converting data from an instrumented gym into estimates of the standard clinical tests; 2)Aim 2: To develop a computer vision-based algorithm to quantify infant motor performance from single camera video. Here using video data from 1200 infants (400 with early brain injury, 400 preterm without early brain injury, 400 controls), plus those gathered from Aim 1 and Aim 3, we will extract pose data from single-camera video recordings and convert these into kinematic features and relevant scores needed to classify infant movement; 3)Aim3: To discover the features related to long-term motor development. Here we will convert data collected longitudinally from 50 infants (25 with early brain injury and 25 controls) using both instrumented gym and video recordings into estimates standard clinical tests change over time and track features over developmental timescales. These three aims spearhead the use of real world behavior for movement scoring. Our aims will bring us closer to a universal non-invasive test for early detection of neurodevelopmental disabilities and lay the groundwork for long-term prediction of disability. But above all, it promises to scale to infants worldwide, producing an affordable tool to aid in infant health assessment. NARRATIVE Increased survival rates of medically fragile infants lead to an increased number of children with functional impairments later in life. Early detection of motor delays or impairments provides the opportunity for early treatment which improves health outcomes. This study will use state of the art sensors combined with machine learning approaches to develop objective, accurate, easy-to-use tools for the early scoring of deficits and lays the foundation for the early prediction of physical disability.",Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability,9765496,R01HD097686,"['Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Asphyxia', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Birth History', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Educational Status', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand Strength', 'Health', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infant Health', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Birth', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Seizures', 'Supination', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'base', 'critical period', 'design', 'disability', 'drug abuse in pregnancy', 'early screening', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neonatal stroke', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'prognostic tool', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'vector']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,711064,0.09098082860121624
"A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Early Childhood Obesity Among WIC Participating Families PROJECT SUMMARY Early childhood obesity continues to be a clinical and public health challenge in the United States; almost a third of children ages 2-to-5 years old are either overweight or obese. Children who are overweight during early childhood are at least 5 times more likely than normal weight children to be overweight/obese as adults. Non- Hispanic blacks (NHB) have double and Hispanics have triple the rates of obesity compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW) and Asians (10.4%,15.6%, 5.2%, and 5.0%, respectively). Once established, obesity and its comorbid medical conditions are difficult to treat and usually persist throughout adulthood. Thus, preventing its development as early as possible in life is critical to reduce the health care costs associated with obesity- related chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Current evidence suggests that pregnancy, infancy and early childhood may be critical time periods in the development of overweight/obesity throughout the lifespan but many knowledge gaps remain. These gaps include understanding factors that contribute to high risk for excessive weight gain during gestation, infancy and early childhood which may also partially explain differential response to intervention strategies. Moreover, risk for the development of overweight and obesity during these critical developmental periods appear to be increased in children from racial and ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status backgrounds, but there is a paucity of studies in the literature that include these groups. To better understand how early life factors impact the onset of childhood obesity by age 5, this study will utilize data from the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program in Miami Dade County (MDC), Florida. Specifically, we will examine the relationship between pregnancy (maternal weight, gestational diabetes, smoking, alcohol/substance use) and early life (initiation, exclusive and duration of breastfeeding, time of introduction to solid food) risk/ protective factors and child body mass index percentile and z score at age 5. Covariates include mother's race/ethnicity, education level and household income. Statistical models will be evaluated using machine learning-cross validation techniques. This approach has not been previously applied to the obesity science to examine pregnancy and early life obesity risk/protective factors. The analyses take advantage of a robust secondary data set that is arguably one of the most diverse in the country; the WIC program currently services almost half of the nation's mothers babies and young children (as does the local program for MDC) who are from predominantly low income and ethnically diverse backgrounds. The findings from this study will inform the development of obesity prevention interventions targeting pregnancy, prenatal and early childhood developmental periods. Project Narrative The proposed research will increase the understanding of pregnancy and early life obesity risk factors and how these factors vary by ethnic group in low income families, addressing a critical gap in the literature. This study will utilize machine learning-cross validation techniques to ensure the external reliability and validity of our statistical models. Study results generated here will inform the development and delivery of pregnancy and early life obesity prevention interventions and actionable recommendations for pediatric and family clinical care delivered to diverse families.",A Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Early Childhood Obesity Among WIC Participating Families,9870787,F31DK116533,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adolescent obesity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Asians', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Comorbidity', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Educational Background', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Exclusive Breastfeeding', 'Family', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Florida', 'Food', 'Food Supplements', 'Genetic', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'High Prevalence', 'Hispanics', 'Household', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Low income', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Nursery Schools', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevalence', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Services', 'Smoke', 'Smoking', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Woman', 'adult obesity', 'clinical care', 'critical developmental period', 'design', 'early childhood', 'early onset', 'ethnic disparity', 'ethnic diversity', 'ethnic minority population', 'federal poverty level', 'feeding', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'low socioeconomic status', 'lower income families', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal weight', 'minority children', 'mortality', 'obesity development', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prevent', 'programs', 'protective factors', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sex', 'statistics', 'systematic review']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,F31,2019,38616,0.002888443078876241
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9701190,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2019,139614,0.051026716985792545
"Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Abstract: The increasing availability of infant brain MR images, such as those that will be collected through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP, on which Dr. Shen is a Co-PI, focusing on data acquisition), affords unprecedented opportunities for precise charting of dynamic early brain developmental trajectories in understanding normative and aberrant growth. However, to fully benefit from these datasets, a major barrier that needs to be overcome is the critical lacking of computational tools for accurate processing and analysis of infant MRI data, which typically exhibit poor tissue contrast, large within tissue intensity variation, and regionally-heterogeneous and dynamic changes. To fill this critical gap, in 2012 we pioneered in creating an infant-centric MRI processing software package, called infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Tool (iBEAT), and a set of infant-specific atlases, called UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases, and further made them freely and publicly available via NITRC. Over the last 4 years, iBEAT and UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases have been downloaded 2900+ and 5600+ times, respectively, and contributed to 160+ independent research papers. As indicated by 30+ support letters, iBEAT is now driving the research for MRI studies of early brain development in many labs throughout the world. Results produced by iBEAT are also highlighted in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT, by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. To achieve this goal, we propose four aims. In Aim 1, we will create an innovative learning-based multi-source information integration framework for joint skull stripping and tissue segmentation for accurate structural measurements. Our method employs random forest to adaptively learn the optimal image appearance features from multimodality images and also informative context features from tissue probability maps. In Aim 2, we will construct longitudinal infant brain atlases at multiple time points (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age) for both T1-/T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR images. We propose a longitudinally-consistent sparse representation technique to construct representative atlases with significantly improved structural details by explicitly dealing with possible misalignments between images even after registration. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel learning-based approach for cortical topology correction and integrate it, along with our infant-centric analysis tools and atlases for cortical surfaces, into iBEAT for precise mapping of dynamic and complex cortical changes in infants. Unlike existing tools that perform poorly for infant brains, we will incorporate infant-dedicated tools for topology correction, surface reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and measurements. We will further integrate longitudinal infant cortical surface atlases equipped with parcellations based on growth trajectories. In Aim 4, we will significantly enhance iBEAT in terms of its software functionalities as well as user support via systematic outreach and training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC. Project Narrative This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. In particular, we propose four aims: 1) Learning-Based Brain Segmentation; 2) Infant Brain Atlases in the First Year of Life; 3) Cortical Surface-Based Analysis; and 4) Enhancing User Experience and Training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC.",Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools,9755508,R01MH117943,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education and Outreach', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'cranium', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'diffusion weighted', 'experience', 'file format', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'random forest', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,465334,0.07839900367670727
"What you see is what you learn: Visual attention in statistical word learning PROJECT SUMMARY Individual differences in the quantity and quality of parent talk and individual differences in infant visual attention predict later vocabulary development, which in turn has the cascading consequences of later cognitive development and school achievement. The proposed research studies how infants prior to their first birthday begin to learn object names, and does so in a unique approach, focusing on how visual information from the infant perspective coincide with parent naming and on how infant looking behavior selects the data to be aggregated and how that selected data changes incrementally in statistical learning. Toward this goal, we will collect a corpus of infant-perspective scenes from 8-12-month-old infants as they play with their parent in a toy room and as parents naturally name objects during play. We will analyze the referential ambiguity of the scenes that co-occur with parent naming events, by showing the scenes to infants and tracking their gaze direction in free viewing. We will use the gaze data to quantify ambiguity in terms of the uncertainty, correctness, and informativeness of the scenes as to the intended object referent. We will then construct training sets for cross-situational learning experiments from the collected scenes by manipulating the mix of high and low ambiguity trials. We will test a series of hypotheses about how infants aggregate information to learn multiple object names.  Moreover, we will feed the trial-by-trial gaze data of individual infants to models to predict final learning outcomes, with the goal of specifying attentional and memory processes that support learning. Our overarching aim of the project is to show that the infant-perspective scenes co- occurring with early naming events have properties that guide and train infant visual attention and in so doing support the learning of names and their referents through the aggregation of information across multiple naming events.

"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9747247,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,682492,0.013344333052874574
"A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome Longitudinal MRI Characterization of Very Early Brain Development  in Infants with Down Syndrome Project Summary/Abstract Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with varying degrees of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Pharmacologic therapies and genetic modulators are emerging which, if administered early in conjunction with traditional therapies, show promise for improving developmental outcomes in children with DS. However, the stark absence of early neurodevelopment knowledge in DS hampers these efforts. The main goal of this proposal is to develop biomarkers as future targets for specific therapies based on careful characterization of early aberrant neurodevelopmental patterns. This study will be a combined effort with WU as the coordinating center and six other research groups: UNC, UW, CHOP, MNI, NYU, and University of Minnesota. These groups comprise the ACE-IBIS (Autism Center of Excellence Infant Brain Imaging Study) network, a well-established and experienced group that has been productively collaborating for 8 years on MRI imaging and behavioral characterization of infants at high risk for autism, healthy typical infants (TYP), and infants with Fragile X. The aims of this proposal are: 1) Define the longitudinal characteristics of early brain development in infants (3 to 24 months) with DS in comparison to TYP infants and infants with other developmental disabilities (ASD and Fragile X) using three different types of neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, rsfMRI); 2) Develop predictive models for developmental outcomes in infants with DS based on longitudinal structural or functional MRI characteristics; and 3) Characterize brain-behavior correlates with coordinated multimodal imaging in infancy characterizing the interrelationship between longitudinal network imaging parameters and cognitive, behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes using sophisticated multivariate support vector machine (SVM) analytic strategies. 120 infants with DS and 40 TYP control infants will be followed longitudinally from 3 to 24 months. MRI scans will be obtained during natural sleep and a series of well-validated developmental and behavioral assessments will be completed at each visit. This project will be the first to define the nature and timing of alterations in brain development in infants with DS. The proposed project addresses several key research recommendations from the “NICHD 2014-The NIH Research Plan on Down Syndrome.” The study aims match the recommendation for the quantitative characterization based on imaging of early brain development and the relationship of cognitive, behavioral and social development to early aberrant neurodevelopment in DS. This project will also address recommendations for investigation of comorbid ASD in DS, which could be as high as 5-10%. The IBIS network is uniquely qualified to examine early neurodevelopmental patterns, utilizing the ASD, TYP and FraX infant data sets to better characterize and examine specificity of DS early developmental patterns including ASD qualities and impairments in social development. It is clear that quantification of neurodevelopmental trajectories in infants with DS will be critical to identification of personalized intervention strategies and to assess the efficacy of early life, targeted, highly novel and mechanistically specific DS interventions. Project Narrative Down's syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with a wide range of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Through the use of cutting edge MRI technology that allows us to look at the shape, function, and connections within the brain, we will be able to study and better understand early brain development in infants with DS. Working toward the goal to be able to assess the impact of specific early intervention therapies that are most helpful in improving the developmental outcomes of children with DS. This study mirrors and expands on the study designs and techniques that were developed to study infants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Fragile X, and typically developing infants, and will allow us to further our understanding of maturation patterns of infant brains that we can apply to DS, ASD, Fragile X, and other disabilities.",A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome,9789674,R01HD088125,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Down Syndrome', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Live Birth', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Minnesota', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social Development', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive development', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data acquisition', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'malformation', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'traditional therapy', 'white matter']",NICHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,2314238,0.016709370022254217
"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features. The Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) will enable clinical staff with only minimal training to cost effectively implement General Movement Assessment (GMA) for Cramped Synchronous General Movements (CSGMs), with interpretive reporting performed automatically. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology for advancement in the identification, characterization and treatment assessment of CP.",Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System,9769890,R43NS098840,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Adoption', 'Advisory Committees', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Network', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Budgets', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collaborations', 'Consensus', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Compromising', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health care facility', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Incidence', 'Income', 'Infant', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Muscle Cramp', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neonatology', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Progress Reports', 'Provider', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specialist', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transportation', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Video Recording', 'Weight', 'Wireless Technology', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'comparative', 'computerized', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'critical period', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'digital', 'experience', 'field study', 'follow-up', 'heuristics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'limb movement', 'miniaturize', 'new technology', 'off-patent', 'perinatal brain', 'postnatal period', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'software systems', 'success', 'tool', 'wireless communication']",NINDS,"NEUROCOMP SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2019,261076,0.06881986292207631
"Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity This proposal describes a rigorous and comprehensive plan designed to obtain expert training in advanced MRI acquisition and analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and fetal programming of health and disease risk. The proposed research relates to the public health problem of childhood obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. Obesity is a multi-factorial phenotype. Among these factors, the critical importance of energy homeostasis (balance), and the hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates it, is well established. However, it is unclear whether the observed difference in this brain circuitry between obese and normal-weight individuals is a cause or consequence of the obese state. Also, relatively little is known about the developmental origin (fetal and early postnatal) of variation in this brain circuitry and its prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. My proposal addresses this fundamental knowledge gap. I advance the overarching hypothesis that energy homeostasis brain circuitry a) already is established by the time of birth; b) exhibits developmental plasticity (fetal programming); and c) is functionally relevant (predicts postnatal adipose tissue accrual). The K99 mentored phase will be conducted under the mentorship of leading experts in fetal programming of health and disease (P. Wadhwa), brain imaging (P. Thompson), and developmental systems neuroscience (D. Fair). I will first develop novel MRI-based measures of the newborn brain circuitry underlying energy homeostasis, and then identify the prenatal determinants of variation in this circuitry. The importance of focusing efforts on the newborn brain derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time is not yet influenced by postnatal factors. In the R00 phase, I will recruit a new cohort and use a repeated measures design to address the functional relevance of the initial (newborn) setting of this brain circuitry in the context of adipose tissue accrual over infancy (a key indicator of childhood obesity risk). K99/Aim 1. Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry, this aim will fulfill an important and as yet unmet need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also technical capability. K99/Aim 2. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology) determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are associated with infant adiposity. R00/Aim 3. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity risk. R00/Aim 4. Consider the complimentary hypothesis that infant adiposity at birth is prospectively associated with changes in newborn energy homeostasis brain circuitry. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan for the applicant, Dr. Jerod Rasmussen, to obtain expert training and conduct research that aims to identify novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, identify their gestational biology determinants, and determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood obesity. The identification of brain-related biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity,9871505,K99HD100593,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemical Shift Imaging', 'Cholesterol', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'data reduction', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'energy balance', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'metabolic rate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'population based', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'sex', 'skills', 'vector', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K99,2019,108276,0.05179206671916053
"Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity This revised application, submitted in response to NIH PA-18-741 “Secondary Analyses in Obesity,  Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,” relates to the public health problem of childhood  obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, determinants and role of energy balance  homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. The proposal describes a comprehensive  plan designed to advance neonatal MRI analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and  fetal programming of health and disease risk. The critical importance of the  hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates energy homeostasis is well  established, and MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuits have been  associated with obesity outcomes. However, it is unclear whether the observed differences in these  brain regions and circuitry in obese relative to normal-weight individuals are a cause,  consequence, or both, of the obese state. Moreover, relatively little is known about the  developmental ontogeny of these brain regions and circuitry, particularly during the fetal period,  and their prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. This project addresses  this fundamental knowledge gap. We will develop novel measures and conduct analyses using newborn  brain imaging and other data elements from 4 inter-linked NIH-funded projects on prenatal stress  and fetal programming of brain development and infant body composition (R01 HD-060628; R01  MH-091351; R01 HD-065825; UG3 OD-023349). The importance of selecting the newborn brain as the  starting time point derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time could not yet have  been influenced by postnatal factors such as diet/feeding, thereby enabling the study to  disentangle the temporality of effects. In a recent position paper on the pathogenesis of obesity,  the U.S. Endocrine Society emphasized the need to conceptualize obesity as a disorder of the  energy homeostasis system and elucidate its underlying mechanisms and developmental influences.  Towards this objective, and using a population of ~100 mother-infant dyads followed from early  gestation through birth till 5 yrs age, we will integrate research aims that leverage the resources  of these projects to advance our understanding of the origins of childhood obesity. Aim 1.  Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional  MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry,  this aim will fulfill an important need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also  technical capability.

"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology.

"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Gestational diabetes (GDM) rates are on the rise in the US, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. GDM is associated with higher rates of large for gestational age (LGA) infants, C-section, and serious perinatal complications, and increased long-term risks of Type 2 diabetes and morbidity in both mothers and infants. Women who get treatment for GDM are less likely to experience perinatal complications and give birth to LGA infants than those who do not; therefore, rapid detection of GDM may be critical to reducing perinatal complications and disparities in birth outcomes. GDM is normally diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks gestation, but clinically important insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction may be missed by not testing earlier. A metabolically unhealthy uterine environment in early pregnancy may lead to long-term negative impacts on mother and child, but how and when to test for insulin resistance and associated metabolic dysfunction in pregnancy is poorly defined. More data are needed on how glucose levels and other metabolic measures change across pregnancy to better evaluate women's metabolic risks and how those risks relate to perinatal and long-term outcomes. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and metabolic biomarker assays, we will describe detailed metabolic phenotype profiles over the course of pregnancy and examine how they are associated with perinatal and postpartum outcomes. We propose to recruit a diverse sample of 400 women in their first trimester from Kaiser Permanente Northwest and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii and to perform CGM, OGTT, and obtain biomarkers at 12 weeks, 20 weeks, and 28 weeks of gestation to examine how these measures relate to each other and to perinatal outcomes. Aim 1 and Aim 3 will assess the effects of CGM variables (Aim 1) and OGTT and other biomarkers (Aim 3) at each time point on the risk of LGA, other perinatal outcomes, and postpartum diabetes. Aim 2 will assess the relationship between CGM variables and diagnosis of GDM by OGTT, as well as the relationship between CGM variables and other metabolic biomarkers. We hypothesize that dysglycemia is just one marker of a much larger metabolic dysregulation that can be characterized through the work of this consortium. Characterizing a broader spectrum of metabolic dysregulation and its association with adverse perinatal outcomes will lead to improved screening regimens and treatments for pregnant women and better outcomes for both mothers and babies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy that increases the risk of pregnancy and birth complications. New tests may allow doctors to identify women with GDM earlier and more accurately than the tests currently being used, but we need to understand them better. We will recruit 400 pregnant women and screen them using both traditional and new GDM screening tools at 12, 20, and 28 weeks of pregnancy to determine how well these tools identify women who are at risk of complications and need treatment.","ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae",9900630,U01DK123791,"['Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'C-Peptide', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cesarean section', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dystocia', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fasting', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fracture', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'OGTT', 'Oral Diagnosis', 'Organogenesis', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Shoulder', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'Uterus', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomarker identification', 'delivery complications', 'early pregnancy', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fetal', 'glucose monitor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'mortality', 'neonatal death', 'obesogenic', 'offspring', 'perinatal complications', 'perinatal outcomes', 'polypeptide C', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'primary outcome', 'racial minority', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'stillbirth', 'tool']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2019,800511,0.01892009811569176
"Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders Project Summary: Early life psychosocial adversity and stress are well-established as the most powerful environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children. Impairments in developing emotion regulation and cognitive control and associated alterations in brain development have been shown to mediate the effects of adversity on risk for the development of psychopathology. Early psychosocial adversity impacts the epigenetic and inflammation-mediated processes that contribute to these negative outcomes, a process known as “biological embedding of stress.” While this risk trajectory has been clearly linked to increased rates of psychopathology, the mechanisms of this process, its targetable mediators and how early in development they operate are yet to be determined. Here we focus on the effects of early life adversity on brain, emotion regulation and cognitive control outcomes relevant to risk for mental disorders, beginning antenatally and extending to age 3. We will examine the role of pre- and postnatal adversity/stress, the maternal and child perinatal gut microbiome and early caregiver support on these key neurodevelopmental outcomes utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging. Our unifying hypothesis is that these factors modulate systemic inflammatory responses, induce neuronal effects through this and other processes that adversely impact brain development in limbic and cortical regions, and mediate the effects of early adversity on child emotion regulation, cognitive control and mental health outcomes. These factors will be studied in a unique, prospectively ascertained cohort of 370 mothers and their offspring at high psychosocial risk being recruited as part of an already funded March of Dimes project at Washington University. The cohort will include both term- and prematurely-born infants and toddlers given the increased risk of psychosocial adversity and aberrant gut microbiome in preterm children. The offspring will be intensively prospectively studied from the 1st trimester to age 3, providing a unique dataset in which to examine the interrelationships among pre- and postnatal adversity, biomarkers of inflammation, the gut microbiome and developmental and mental health outcomes. The perinatal and early childhood periods are critical times to study these exposures as adverse neurodevelopment associated with adversity begins in utero through fetal programming. Likewise, the perinatal period is a critical developmental window for microbial influences, when gut microbial colonization has its most enduring effects. The proposed study merges established research groups in these areas in a center with advanced infant and childhood neuroimaging and extensive microbiome expertise, and offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand the mechanisms of the biological embedding of adversity on brain, cognitive and emotional trajectories in a high-risk cohort. We will also apply innovative computational methods, using Deep Learning, to extend understanding of these data. Findings will provide critical and novel insights to inform early preventive interventions relevant to emotional, cognitive and mental health outcomes for children at greatest risk. Project Narrative This study will investigate the mechanisms by which psychosocial adversity experienced in utero and early in life impact the child’s brain, cognitive and emotional development, testing the hypothesis that stress and adversity during pregnancy adversely affect early brain development through inflammatory mechanisms. Another important focus of this project is to examine how the maternal perinatal microbiome and infant’s gut microbiome during early childhood impact brain development, either through the infant’s inflammatory response or other effects. A third focus is to explore the effects of caregiver support on this risk trajectory, testing the idea that high caregiver support reduces the negative influences of early adversity, altered immune biomarkers and disruptions in the gut microbiome.","Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders",9701281,R01MH113883,"['3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caregiver support', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Funding', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informal Social Control', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mothers', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Poverty', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'antenatal', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'gray matter', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiome', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal period', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,2374629,0.019525471320597156
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates.

"Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood traumatic stress (CTS), resulting from experiences such as abuse and neglect, is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences effecting overall health across the lifespan. Growing evidence shows that the negative effects of CTS are not limited to a single individual and may be transmitted across generations, increasing the risk for behavioral and psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Psychological stress during pregnancy is associated with heightened stress responses, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral problems in infancy and early childhood potentially making it a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The majority of studies examining maternal psychological stress (MPS) during pregnancy consider the magnitude of stress as the `risk factor' for alterations in offspring development; however, psychological stress, particularly during the prenatal period, is dynamic and variable. Infant neurodevelopment occurs sequentially and is sensitive to environmental influences, meaning that the effect of any insult is likely as much about the timing, as it is the magnitude. As a result, it remains unclear which aspects of stress most strongly impact offspring development – is it simply the magnitude as previously suggested, or does the trajectory matter as well? Understanding the variability of prenatal factors and their influence on infant neurobiological and psychosocial development is critical to targeting preventive interventions. The goal of this proposal is to explore maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress. The overall hypothesis is that a history of maternal CTS will increase the amplitude and velocity of MPS trajectories compared to a low-risk group, will predict increased offspring limbic system connectivity and negative affect expression, and that an intervention to reduce MPS in a high-risk sample will alter the observed trajectories. These hypotheses will be tested using a novel methodology that characterizes the longitudinal heterogeneity of psychological symptom data to create MPS trajectories. These trajectories will be used to explore the role of timing and rate of change of MPS on offspring neurobiological and affective development and, further, to test whether these trajectories mediate the effects of CTS on infant development. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To characterize the longitudinal heterogeneity of MPS in a sample of women with and without a history of CTS; (2) To examine the effects of heterogeneous longitudinal trajectories in MPS on offspring limbic system and negative affect development in mothers with and without childhood trauma; and (3) (Exploratory) To determine whether an intervention designed to reduce MPS will alter MPS trajectories in a high-risk sample. This study aims to elucidate the importance of trajectories of MPS for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS. Achieving these goals will provide insight into the best timing for targeted screening and interventions to alter MPS during pregnancy for women with a history of CTS and, thereby, reduce the risk of offspring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood traumatic stress is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences for psychological well-being, such as increased stress reactivity and increased risk for perinatal psychopathology. The proposed research will integrate tools from developmental neuroscience, clinical science, and computer science to: (1) examine the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a potential mediator of childhood traumatic stress on infant brain and negative affect development; and (2) evaluate whether an intervention designed to reduce maternal psychological stress will alter the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal prenatal stress. By identifying the importance of trajectories of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS, this work stands to improve the targeting and timing of prenatal interventions for women with a history of childhood traumatic stress.",Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress,9794014,F30MH118762,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Limbic System', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'maternal stress', 'mindfulness based cognitive therapy', 'negative affect', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatric trauma', 'prenatal', 'prenatal intervention', 'prenatal stress', 'psychological symptom', 'psychosocial development', 'random forest', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'stress reactivity', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2019,50016,0.02141375294992516
"Place-level discrimination and birth outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability. In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination partially contributes to this disparity. Most of research on discrimination and birth outcomes relies on self-reported experiences of discrimination, and there have been few studies examining discrimination at the U.S. national level. Social contexts in which greater hostility towards minorities is manifested may cause psychological stress and increase risk of adverse birth outcomes. The scientific objective of this research plan is to develop a new county-level indicator of discriminatory attitudes from social media data as well as make use hate crimes data and measures of explicit and implicit racial bias to provide a detailed and nuanced investigation of the impact of discrimination on birth outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities in birth outcomes. Another strength of this research plan is the longitudinal study design with multiple years of data for both measures of discrimination and birth outcomes, which allows us to control for temporal trends and stable characteristics of the counties. Furthermore, the influence of discrimination on birth outcomes may begin prior to pregnancy. There is increasing recognition of maternal health prior to conception influencing fetal development and birth outcomes. The project will empirically evaluate whether place-level discrimination is associated with biomarkers of chronic stress among young women of child-bearing age. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in: 1) developing expertise in Big Data, 2) measurement of discrimination, and 3) stress physiology and birth outcomes. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career evaluating how discrimination impact minority health and health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability. In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination partially contributes to this disparity.

"Neurocognitive outcomes and changes in brain and CSF volume after treatment of post-infectious hydrocephalus in Ugandan infants by shunting or ETV/CPC: a randomized prospective trial We estimate 250,000 new infants develop hydrocephalus, most commonly following neonatal infection, in sub- Saharan Africa (SSA) each year. Most have poor access to treatment. We developed and validated a novel operative treatment for infant hydrocephalus combining endoscopic third ventriculostomy and choroid plexus cauterization (ETV/CPC) that avoids shunt dependence in the majority. Our prior collaborative work at CURE Children’s Hospital of Uganda (CCHU) supported equipoise between shunt placement and ETV/CPC in regard to 5-year survival and development. That ETV/CPC prevents shunt dependence among those with no urgent access for shunt malfunction is compelling, but we do not know which treatment optimizes development. We seek to confirm the optimal treatment selection paradigm. Using CT-based measures we found that brain and CSF volume discriminated neurocognitive outcome, providing a promising objective measure of hydrocephalus treatment efficacy. Preliminary data from our R-21 and R01 funded randomized controlled trial (RCT) of ETV/CPC vs. shunt for PIH treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT01936272) have shown no important differences at one year in regard to safety, efficacy, developmental outcome, or brain growth Those achieving normal or near-normal brain volume by 1 year, regardless of preop volume, had the best outcome. The current proposal seeks to accomplish the following aims: 1) test the hypothesis that endoscopic treatment of PIH is better than or equal to shunt placement in regard to five-year neurocognitive development; 2) further develop CCHU as a neuroscience research facility; 3) develop the in-country capacity for sustainable ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI imaging; 4) install optimized ULF-MRI at CCHU; 5) Correlate MRI-derived brain/CSF volume metrics with long-term neurocognitive development following PIH treatment. As planned, the RCT patient study cohort will undergo further developmental assessment using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) at 24 months post- operatively along with repeat CT-based brain and CSF volume metrics. In the current proposal, developmental assessment will be conducted at 5 years post-treatment using the Vineland-III, as well as an assessment of quality of life. After developing Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) as an ULF-MRI demonstration and resource center, ULF-MRI will be installed at CCHU for evaluation as a volumetric and diagnostic tool compared to CT. Neurocognitive outcome will be correlated with pre- and post-operative MRI- based brain/CSF volumes and treatment modality. Extension of the study will determine whether non-inferiority of ETV/CPC to shunt in regard to developmental outcome and brain growth persists at 5 years post-treatment, whether MRI-based volume metrics effectively supplant CT-based measures, and whether brain and CSF volumetrics prove useful in guiding optimal clinical management. The proposed project will determine whether ETV/CPC is the preferred initial treatment and will further develop research capacity at CCHU. Project Narrative We have established neonatal postinfectious hydrocephalus (PIH) as a major public health problem in East Africa for which there are two strategies of treatment – shunting versus endoscopic third ventriculostomy + choroid plexus cauterization (ETV/CPC), which we developed – with no definitive evidence supporting which therapy is optimal. Our randomized controlled trial of ETV/CPC vs. shunt for PIH has shown no difference in success rate, developmental outcome or brain growth at one year following treatment, with better outcome among those demonstrating “catch-up” brain growth after treatment. We here propose extended follow up of the existing study cohort to analyze early childhood development at 5 years after treatment and to implement new sustainable ultra-low-field MRI technology for brain and CSF volume metrics to provide an evidence- based foundation for better treatment of such children.",Neurocognitive outcomes and changes in brain and CSF volume after treatment of post-infectious hydrocephalus in Ugandan infants by shunting or ETV/CPC: a randomized prospective trial,9751092,R01HD085853,"['7 year old', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Aftercare', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cauterize', 'Child', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Equipoise', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human Resources', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infrastructure', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Neonatal', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-of-Life Assessment', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ventriculostomy', 'Work', 'base', 'brain volume', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'design', 'early childhood', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'neonatal infection', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research facility', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2019,10000,0.036471768223940174
"Impact of Maternal Diet and Supplements on Breast Milk Composition Breast-feeding is recommended to prevent the development of allergic diseases, but mechanisms are unclear. Human milk is a source of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and fatty acids (FAs), which are likely impacted by maternal diet. HMOs are complex glycans prevalent in human milk; non-digestible by humans, but one of the main substrates for the infant gut microbiota. We have recently shown that mothers' milk has significant variations in qualitative and quantitative HMO composition, depending on genetics and maternal probiotic supplementation. Human milk is a rich source of FAs such as polyunsaturated (PUFAs) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs); these are strongly influenced by maternal diet and could directly induce mucosal immunity. The impact of maternal diet and supplements on immunomodulatory composition of human milk is poorly characterized and varies between mothers.  Our initial studies have shown that certain HMOs are associated with protection against cow's milk allergy in the infant, but the mechanisms are not known. Our initial study in the Old Order Mennonites (OOM), who have a lifestyle dating back to 150 years ago and rich exposure to unpasteurized milk, indicated a low prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases, compared to the Rochester population. OOM mothers also have rich sources of diet-based probiotics such as unpasteurized dairy products (kefir, yogurt, cheese, butter); these can significantly affect their breast milk FA and HMO composition, whereas OTC supplement use may not be common. Our central hypothesis is that factors related to OOM diet decrease the risk of allergies through impact on human milk composition. Our preliminary data suggests that the infant gut microbiome is enriched in Bifidobacteria in the OOM. Bifidobacteria in turn are largely impacted by human milk composition.  The overall objective of this supplemental application is to expand our ongoing longitudinal infant cohort study, entitled “Mucosal and systemic immunity and food allergy” (U01 AI131344), by gathering and analyzing samples to define the role of maternal diet, including dietary and OTC probiotics on human milk composition, and to assess their impact on infant immunity. The parent study is characterizing the infant gut microbiome, immune markers and atopic diseases in the first year of life in OOM and Rochester infants. We have a unique opportunity to investigate maternal dietary impact on human milk composition. This additional data along with modeling as part of the parent grant will provide holistic understanding of interactions between OOM lifestyle and infant gut microbiome composition, immune markers and allergic disease outcomes in infants. 1 Our initial study in the Old Order Mennonites (OOM), who have a lifestyle dating back to 150 years ago and rich exposure to unpasteurized milk, indicated a low prevalence of asthma and allergic diseases, compared to the Rochester population.

"Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants PROJECT SUMMARY Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening, gastrointestinal (GI) emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. ""Leaky gut"", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal permeability (IP), is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC in preterm neonates. Early detection of leaky gut is essential to identify infants at risk for NEC to prevent and reduce disease severity. No clinical factor, routine laboratory test or biomarker alone or in combination have been described that identify preterm neonates with impaired intestinal barrier function who at increased risk for NEC. The goal of this study is to develop a rapid, non-invasive screening tool to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. We recently revealed rapid maturation of the intestinal barrier is strongly associated with clinical factors such as early breastmilk feeding, less antibiotic exposure and later post-menstrual age, and significantly higher abundance and metabolic activities of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Although the butyrate producing Clostridiales have been implicated in strengthening the intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing intestinal inflammation, it is unknown whether butyrate and potentially other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with neonatal intestinal barrier maturation. Our preliminary data revealed butyrate production pathways, in particular Pyruvate/Acetyl-CoA pathway are significantly more abundant in low IP subjects. In this study, we propose to validate a substantiated measure of fecal microbial and/or metabolic biomarkers combined with associated neonatal factors for a rapid, non-invasive screening test. We postulate that the level(s) of metabolic activities, particularly butyrate production and potentially other SCFAs via increased colonization of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium, are associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates. To address our hypothesis, we will leverage existed stool samples collected from a cohort of ~200 preterms (<33 weeks), for whom both microbiota (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and IP (urine non-metabolized sugar probes lactulose and rhamnose) are available, and propose 2 aims: 1) to determine fecal metabolic activities associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestation; and 2) to identify and characterize butyrate-producing bacteria associated with intestinal permeability in preterm neonates during the first 7-10 days of life. At the completion of the study, we will determine the biomarkers associated with healthy intestinal barrier functions and the discriminatory scheme for accurate classification of high or low IP group. Our long-term goal is to conduct a randomize clinical trial of rationally designed intervention for NEC early prevention. Refinement of the screening tool will identify infants with aberrant leaky gut, an essential prerequisite for subsequent rational design of novel strategies such as clinical trials of probiotics to promote healthy intestinal barrier functions to reduce NEC incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE ""Leaky gut"", is the proximate cause of susceptibility to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening, gastrointestinal emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%.

The results of this study will support clinical trials aimed to optimize intestinal maturation and to reduce the burden of NEC complications.

"Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome Project Summary/Abstract The high risk of neurodevelopmental impairments is a major concern for parents and clinicians caring for premature babies. Annually, approximately 22,000 very preterm infants (i.e. ≤32 weeks gestational age) in the United States develop cognitive deficits. Efforts to target interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental sequelae are hampered by our current inability to diagnose disabilities before the age of 3 to 5 years. Research supports the notion that cognitive deficits may result from a perturbation of neural connection and communication. Recent brain connectome studies in adults and older children show that abnormal network properties are useful as prognostic biomarkers. Many of these studies have exploited machine learning models based on brain connectome data for the prediction of a variety of neurological conditions, however this progress has not been fully extended to the preterm population. Our preliminary studies suggest that early and accurate prediction of cognitive deficits at an individual level is possible using machine learning models based on brain connectome features at term corrected age (CA). We have correctly classified 91.3% of very preterm infants at high risk of cognitive deficits with 90% specificity and 92.3% sensitivity. Our overall objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that can analyze integrated structural and functional brain connectome data obtained at term CA to make a prediction of later cognitive deficits in very preterm infants. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning techniques analyzing integrated structural and functional brain connectome features at birth can predict cognitive deficits at 2 years CA at an individual level in very preterm infants with accuracy of greater than 90%, exceeding the performance of current classical multivariate analyses. The two specific aims to test the central hypothesis are: 1) Develop and implement a machine learning model to extract high-level brain connectome features and 2) Develop and validate a machine learning framework to predict cognitive deficits. On completion of the first aim, we will explicate the brain connectome, and extract high-dimensional connectome features that best represent the brain connectome. In the second aim, the machine learning model we proposed will be applied in predicting both cognitive deficit (i.e. 2-class classification) and cognitive scores on a continuous scale (i.e., regression) at 2 years CA. To quantify the model's discrimination, we will also validate its performance in data that are not used for the model development, and compare with the current conventional multivariate approach. The proposed research is significant because it will increase scientific knowledge about the developing brain connectome in very preterm infants and facilitate earlier identification of babies at high risk of neurodevelopmental deficits, allowing timely clinical interventions for optimal cognitive outcome. Project Narrative Babies born before 32 weeks' gestational age are at a very high risk of developing cognitive deficits, which may impact their brain function in many ways, including life-long learning difficulties. Fortunately, infant brains are highly malleable, so it is important to identify those at highest risk as early as possible to allow effective early interventions. We propose to apply a reliable, accurate and sensitive artificial intelligence approach based on state-of-the-art brain MRI to allow identification of babies at highest risk of learning difficulties.",Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome,9432651,R21HD094085,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Premature Infant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'connectome', 'disability', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'interest', 'life-long learning', 'medical complication', 'model development', 'neonate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2018,198750,0.04625621353203687
"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,9558014,R44HD095783,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2018,605627,0.06035992816063652
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ! Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9526588,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'screening', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2018,141114,0.051026716985792545
"What you see is what you learn: Visual attention in statistical word learning PROJECT SUMMARY Individual differences in the quantity and quality of parent talk and individual differences in infant visual attention predict later vocabulary development, which in turn has the cascading consequences of later cognitive development and school achievement. The proposed research studies how infants prior to their first birthday begin to learn object names, and does so in a unique approach, focusing on how visual information from the infant perspective coincide with parent naming and on how infant looking behavior selects the data to be aggregated and how that selected data changes incrementally in statistical learning. Toward this goal, we will collect a corpus of infant-perspective scenes from 8-12-month-old infants as they play with their parent in a toy room and as parents naturally name objects during play. We will analyze the referential ambiguity of the scenes that co-occur with parent naming events, by showing the scenes to infants and tracking their gaze direction in free viewing. We will use the gaze data to quantify ambiguity in terms of the uncertainty, correctness, and informativeness of the scenes as to the intended object referent. We will then construct training sets for cross-situational learning experiments from the collected scenes by manipulating the mix of high and low ambiguity trials. We will test a series of hypotheses about how infants aggregate information to learn multiple object names.  Moreover, we will feed the trial-by-trial gaze data of individual infants to models to predict final learning outcomes, with the goal of specifying attentional and memory processes that support learning. Our overarching aim of the project is to show that the infant-perspective scenes co- occurring with early naming events have properties that guide and train infant visual attention and in so doing support the learning of names and their referents through the aggregation of information across multiple naming events.

"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9538116,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,679633,0.013344333052874574
"A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome Longitudinal MRI Characterization of Very Early Brain Development  in Infants with Down Syndrome Project Summary/Abstract Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with varying degrees of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Pharmacologic therapies and genetic modulators are emerging which, if administered early in conjunction with traditional therapies, show promise for improving developmental outcomes in children with DS. However, the stark absence of early neurodevelopment knowledge in DS hampers these efforts. The main goal of this proposal is to develop biomarkers as future targets for specific therapies based on careful characterization of early aberrant neurodevelopmental patterns. This study will be a combined effort with WU as the coordinating center and six other research groups: UNC, UW, CHOP, MNI, NYU, and University of Minnesota. These groups comprise the ACE-IBIS (Autism Center of Excellence Infant Brain Imaging Study) network, a well-established and experienced group that has been productively collaborating for 8 years on MRI imaging and behavioral characterization of infants at high risk for autism, healthy typical infants (TYP), and infants with Fragile X. The aims of this proposal are: 1) Define the longitudinal characteristics of early brain development in infants (3 to 24 months) with DS in comparison to TYP infants and infants with other developmental disabilities (ASD and Fragile X) using three different types of neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, rsfMRI); 2) Develop predictive models for developmental outcomes in infants with DS based on longitudinal structural or functional MRI characteristics; and 3) Characterize brain-behavior correlates with coordinated multimodal imaging in infancy characterizing the interrelationship between longitudinal network imaging parameters and cognitive, behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes using sophisticated multivariate support vector machine (SVM) analytic strategies. 120 infants with DS and 40 TYP control infants will be followed longitudinally from 3 to 24 months. MRI scans will be obtained during natural sleep and a series of well-validated developmental and behavioral assessments will be completed at each visit. This project will be the first to define the nature and timing of alterations in brain development in infants with DS. The proposed project addresses several key research recommendations from the “NICHD 2014-The NIH Research Plan on Down Syndrome.” The study aims match the recommendation for the quantitative characterization based on imaging of early brain development and the relationship of cognitive, behavioral and social development to early aberrant neurodevelopment in DS. This project will also address recommendations for investigation of comorbid ASD in DS, which could be as high as 5-10%. The IBIS network is uniquely qualified to examine early neurodevelopmental patterns, utilizing the ASD, TYP and FraX infant data sets to better characterize and examine specificity of DS early developmental patterns including ASD qualities and impairments in social development. It is clear that quantification of neurodevelopmental trajectories in infants with DS will be critical to identification of personalized intervention strategies and to assess the efficacy of early life, targeted, highly novel and mechanistically specific DS interventions. Project Narrative Down's syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with a wide range of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Through the use of cutting edge MRI technology that allows us to look at the shape, function, and connections within the brain, we will be able to study and better understand early brain development in infants with DS. Working toward the goal to be able to assess the impact of specific early intervention therapies that are most helpful in improving the developmental outcomes of children with DS. This study mirrors and expands on the study designs and techniques that were developed to study infants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Fragile X, and typically developing infants, and will allow us to further our understanding of maturation patterns of infant brains that we can apply to DS, ASD, Fragile X, and other disabilities.",A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome,9263673,R01HD088125,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Down Syndrome', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Live Birth', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Minnesota', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social Development', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive development', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data acquisition', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'malformation', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'traditional therapy', 'white matter']",NICHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,2297205,0.016709370022254217
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9548924,K02NS089852,"['2 year old', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early identification', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor deficit', 'motor impairment', 'neonatal brain', 'neonatal period', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2018,137131,0.03440083894496632
"Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System PROJECT SUMMARY AND ABSTRACT [ Pediatric specialists are often required to identify infants who are likely to suffer poor neurodevelopmental outcome, including Cerebral Palsy (CP). CP is the most common developmental disability among children in the United States and results from several factors, including low weight for gestational age, premature birth, and stroke. Although MRI and cranial ultrasound (cUS) provide valuable structural information in the preterm period, they have moderate sensitivity to CP and require transportation of the infant. Over the past 20 years, numerous studies have validated the clinical potential of General Movement Assessment (GMA) for CP risk identification. During the early period, (23 weeks to 36 weeks gestational age), the presence of Cramped Synchronized General Movements (CSGMs), has demonstrated very high sensitivity and specificity for CP, conjointly ranging from 80%-98%. CSGMs are assessed while preterm infants are still in an acute care facility (NICU) and can inform the clinician independently, and in combination with cUS and MRI. Despite its potential, GMA is available in only a few clinical centers, as adoption and routine application depend on lengthy, cost-intensive observation and availability of specially trained raters. A Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) is proposed that will automate GMA for bedside evaluations in both preterm and postterm periods. The CPRIS constitutes a key enabling technology not only for routine risk identification, but also for establishing disease trajectory and potentially differentiating CP subtypes and assessing efficacy of emerging treatments along the early developmental continuum.  Preliminary studies at UC Irvine have demonstrated that GMA analysis for CSGMs can be automated by quantifying infant limb movement using highly miniaturized, 3-axis wireless accelerometers and classifying CSGMs using a patented Markov-type approach that merges an application-specific Erlang-Cox state transition model with a Dynamic Bayesian Network (“EC-DBN”), treating instantaneous machine learning classification values as observations and explicitly modeling CSGM (and non-CSGM) duration and interval. In Phase I, this approach will be utilized in a comparative evaluation of two movement measurement modalities to determine which has the best overall performance and clinical utility at three leading NICU centers. Infant movement data will be concurrently acquired using an advanced, second generation prototype wireless accelerometer system (CPRIS-A) and a high definition 3D (infrared) optical camera (CPRIS-O). The optical modality offers significant potential advantages as it requires no infant contact and can monitor unattended, intermittently, over weeks or months. However, its potential for GMA automation must be systematically evaluated. Classifier results from both modalities will be compared to expert rater consensus in 80 preterm infants. The primary outcome will be CSGM identification accuracy, as determined by ROC-AUC analyses, with a threshold for success of 0.85. Additional comparative performance measures include reliability and practicability in the NICU environment. An Advisory Committee of experts in the fields of neonatology, pediatrics and cerebral palsy will evaluate project results and advise on the clinical potential of each modality. ] PROJECT NARRATIVE Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability in childhood, with a prevalence of 2.1 cases per 1000 in high-income countries. The overall project goal is to develop a computerized hardware-software system capable of identifying preterm infants at high risk of developing cerebral palsy (CP), based on the systematic identification of specific patterns of movement-derived features. The Cerebral Palsy Risk Identification System (CPRIS) will enable clinical staff with only minimal training to cost effectively implement General Movement Assessment (GMA) for Cramped Synchronous General Movements (CSGMs), with interpretive reporting performed automatically.

"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9545867,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process', 'wearable sensor technology']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2018,117680,0.037671952703136655
"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders Project Summary: Early life psychosocial adversity and stress are well-established as the most powerful environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children. Impairments in developing emotion regulation and cognitive control and associated alterations in brain development have been shown to mediate the effects of adversity on risk for the development of psychopathology. Early psychosocial adversity impacts the epigenetic and inflammation-mediated processes that contribute to these negative outcomes, a process known as “biological embedding of stress.” While this risk trajectory has been clearly linked to increased rates of psychopathology, the mechanisms of this process, its targetable mediators and how early in development they operate are yet to be determined. Here we focus on the effects of early life adversity on brain, emotion regulation and cognitive control outcomes relevant to risk for mental disorders, beginning antenatally and extending to age 3. We will examine the role of pre- and postnatal adversity/stress, the maternal and child perinatal gut microbiome and early caregiver support on these key neurodevelopmental outcomes utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging. Our unifying hypothesis is that these factors modulate systemic inflammatory responses, induce neuronal effects through this and other processes that adversely impact brain development in limbic and cortical regions, and mediate the effects of early adversity on child emotion regulation, cognitive control and mental health outcomes. These factors will be studied in a unique, prospectively ascertained cohort of 370 mothers and their offspring at high psychosocial risk being recruited as part of an already funded March of Dimes project at Washington University. The cohort will include both term- and prematurely-born infants and toddlers given the increased risk of psychosocial adversity and aberrant gut microbiome in preterm children. The offspring will be intensively prospectively studied from the 1st trimester to age 3, providing a unique dataset in which to examine the interrelationships among pre- and postnatal adversity, biomarkers of inflammation, the gut microbiome and developmental and mental health outcomes. The perinatal and early childhood periods are critical times to study these exposures as adverse neurodevelopment associated with adversity begins in utero through fetal programming. Likewise, the perinatal period is a critical developmental window for microbial influences, when gut microbial colonization has its most enduring effects. The proposed study merges established research groups in these areas in a center with advanced infant and childhood neuroimaging and extensive microbiome expertise, and offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand the mechanisms of the biological embedding of adversity on brain, cognitive and emotional trajectories in a high-risk cohort. We will also apply innovative computational methods, using Deep Learning, to extend understanding of these data. Findings will provide critical and novel insights to inform early preventive interventions relevant to emotional, cognitive and mental health outcomes for children at greatest risk. Project Narrative This study will investigate the mechanisms by which psychosocial adversity experienced in utero and early in life impact the child’s brain, cognitive and emotional development, testing the hypothesis that stress and adversity during pregnancy adversely affect early brain development through inflammatory mechanisms. Another important focus of this project is to examine how the maternal perinatal microbiome and infant’s gut microbiome during early childhood impact brain development, either through the infant’s inflammatory response or other effects. A third focus is to explore the effects of caregiver support on this risk trajectory, testing the idea that high caregiver support reduces the negative influences of early adversity, altered immune biomarkers and disruptions in the gut microbiome.","Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders",9518320,R01MH113883,"['3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caregiver support', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Funding', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informal Social Control', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mothers', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Poverty', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'antenatal', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'gray matter', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiome', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal period', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,1996238,0.019525471320597156
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9568765,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multitask', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'premature neonates', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,392718,0.0016045156709692523
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9553779,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA analysis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'dysbiosis', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'fecal microbiome', 'fecal microbiota', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gene complementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'stool sample', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2018,619708,0.055299157898797704
"Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Abstract: The increasing availability of infant brain MR images, such as those that will be collected through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP, on which Dr. Shen is a Co-PI, focusing on data acquisition), affords unprecedented opportunities for precise charting of dynamic early brain developmental trajectories in understanding normative and aberrant growth. However, to fully benefit from these datasets, a major barrier that needs to be overcome is the critical lacking of computational tools for accurate processing and analysis of infant MRI data, which typically exhibit poor tissue contrast, large within tissue intensity variation, and regionally-heterogeneous and dynamic changes. To fill this critical gap, in 2012 we pioneered in creating an infant-centric MRI processing software package, called infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Tool (iBEAT), and a set of infant-specific atlases, called UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases, and further made them freely and publicly available via NITRC. Over the last 4 years, iBEAT and UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases have been downloaded 2900+ and 5600+ times, respectively, and contributed to 160+ independent research papers. As indicated by 30+ support letters, iBEAT is now driving the research for MRI studies of early brain development in many labs throughout the world. Results produced by iBEAT are also highlighted in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT, by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. To achieve this goal, we propose four aims. In Aim 1, we will create an innovative learning-based multi-source information integration framework for joint skull stripping and tissue segmentation for accurate structural measurements. Our method employs random forest to adaptively learn the optimal image appearance features from multimodality images and also informative context features from tissue probability maps. In Aim 2, we will construct longitudinal infant brain atlases at multiple time points (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age) for both T1-/T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR images. We propose a longitudinally-consistent sparse representation technique to construct representative atlases with significantly improved structural details by explicitly dealing with possible misalignments between images even after registration. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel learning-based approach for cortical topology correction and integrate it, along with our infant-centric analysis tools and atlases for cortical surfaces, into iBEAT for precise mapping of dynamic and complex cortical changes in infants. Unlike existing tools that perform poorly for infant brains, we will incorporate infant-dedicated tools for topology correction, surface reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and measurements. We will further integrate longitudinal infant cortical surface atlases equipped with parcellations based on growth trajectories. In Aim 4, we will significantly enhance iBEAT in terms of its software functionalities as well as user support via systematic outreach and training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC. Project Narrative This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. In particular, we propose four aims: 1) Learning-Based Brain Segmentation; 2) Infant Brain Atlases in the First Year of Life; 3) Cortical Surface-Based Analysis; and 4) Enhancing User Experience and Training.

"Place-level discrimination and birth outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY  Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability. In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination partially contributes to this disparity. Most of research on discrimination and birth outcomes relies on self-reported experiences of discrimination, and there have been few studies examining discrimination at the U.S. national level. Social contexts in which greater hostility towards minorities is manifested may cause psychological stress and increase risk of adverse birth outcomes. The scientific objective of this research plan is to develop a new county-level indicator of discriminatory attitudes from social media data as well as make use hate crimes data and measures of explicit and implicit racial bias to provide a detailed and nuanced investigation of the impact of discrimination on birth outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities in birth outcomes. Another strength of this research plan is the longitudinal study design with multiple years of data for both measures of discrimination and birth outcomes, which allows us to control for temporal trends and stable characteristics of the counties. Furthermore, the influence of discrimination on birth outcomes may begin prior to pregnancy. There is increasing recognition of maternal health prior to conception influencing fetal development and birth outcomes. The project will empirically evaluate whether place-level discrimination is associated with biomarkers of chronic stress among young women of child-bearing age. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in: 1) developing expertise in Big Data, 2) measurement of discrimination, and 3) stress physiology and birth outcomes. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful independent research career evaluating how discrimination impact minority health and health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability. In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination partially contributes to this disparity. Using national data at multiple points in time, the result of this project will quantify the extent to which place-level discrimination impacts birth outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities in birth outcomes.",Place-level discrimination and birth outcomes,9504439,K99MD012615,"['Attitude', 'Behavior', 'Belief', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Chronic stress', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Conceptions', 'Country', 'County', 'Crime', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discrimination', 'Epidemiology', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exposure to', 'Female of child bearing age', 'Fetal Development', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geography', 'Hate', 'Health', 'Hostility', 'Individual', 'Infant Mortality', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal and Child Health', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Mentorship', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcome', 'Psychological Stress', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Shapes', 'Social Environment', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time trend', 'Training', 'allostatic load', 'body language', 'career', 'disability', 'ethnic disparity', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'health disparity', 'member', 'minority health', 'multidisciplinary', 'physical conditioning', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial bias', 'racial disparity', 'racial identity', 'racial minority', 'social', 'social media', 'statistics', 'stem', 'young woman']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2018,135437,0.021092507639930636
"Neurocognitive outcomes and changes in brain and CSF volume after treatment of post-infectious hydrocephalus in Ugandan infants by shunting or ETV/CPC: a randomized prospective trial We estimate 250,000 new infants develop hydrocephalus, most commonly following neonatal infection, in sub- Saharan Africa (SSA) each year. Most have poor access to treatment. We developed and validated a novel operative treatment for infant hydrocephalus combining endoscopic third ventriculostomy and choroid plexus cauterization (ETV/CPC) that avoids shunt dependence in the majority. Our prior collaborative work at CURE Children’s Hospital of Uganda (CCHU) supported equipoise between shunt placement and ETV/CPC in regard to 5-year survival and development. That ETV/CPC prevents shunt dependence among those with no urgent access for shunt malfunction is compelling, but we do not know which treatment optimizes development. We seek to confirm the optimal treatment selection paradigm. Using CT-based measures we found that brain and CSF volume discriminated neurocognitive outcome, providing a promising objective measure of hydrocephalus treatment efficacy. Preliminary data from our R-21 and R01 funded randomized controlled trial (RCT) of ETV/CPC vs. shunt for PIH treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov registration NCT01936272) have shown no important differences at one year in regard to safety, efficacy, developmental outcome, or brain growth Those achieving normal or near-normal brain volume by 1 year, regardless of preop volume, had the best outcome. The current proposal seeks to accomplish the following aims: 1) test the hypothesis that endoscopic treatment of PIH is better than or equal to shunt placement in regard to five-year neurocognitive development; 2) further develop CCHU as a neuroscience research facility; 3) develop the in-country capacity for sustainable ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI imaging; 4) install optimized ULF-MRI at CCHU; 5) Correlate MRI-derived brain/CSF volume metrics with long-term neurocognitive development following PIH treatment. As planned, the RCT patient study cohort will undergo further developmental assessment using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID-III) at 24 months post- operatively along with repeat CT-based brain and CSF volume metrics. In the current proposal, developmental assessment will be conducted at 5 years post-treatment using the Vineland-III, as well as an assessment of quality of life. After developing Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) as an ULF-MRI demonstration and resource center, ULF-MRI will be installed at CCHU for evaluation as a volumetric and diagnostic tool compared to CT. Neurocognitive outcome will be correlated with pre- and post-operative MRI- based brain/CSF volumes and treatment modality. Extension of the study will determine whether non-inferiority of ETV/CPC to shunt in regard to developmental outcome and brain growth persists at 5 years post-treatment, whether MRI-based volume metrics effectively supplant CT-based measures, and whether brain and CSF volumetrics prove useful in guiding optimal clinical management. The proposed project will determine whether ETV/CPC is the preferred initial treatment and will further develop research capacity at CCHU. Project Narrative We have established neonatal postinfectious hydrocephalus (PIH) as a major public health problem in East Africa for which there are two strategies of treatment – shunting versus endoscopic third ventriculostomy + choroid plexus cauterization (ETV/CPC), which we developed – with no definitive evidence supporting which therapy is optimal. Our randomized controlled trial of ETV/CPC vs. shunt for PIH has shown no difference in success rate, developmental outcome or brain growth at one year following treatment, with better outcome among those demonstrating “catch-up” brain growth after treatment. We here propose extended follow up of the existing study cohort to analyze early childhood development at 5 years after treatment and to implement new sustainable ultra-low-field MRI technology for brain and CSF volume metrics to provide an evidence- based foundation for better treatment of such children.",Neurocognitive outcomes and changes in brain and CSF volume after treatment of post-infectious hydrocephalus in Ugandan infants by shunting or ETV/CPC: a randomized prospective trial,9553835,R01HD085853,"['7 year old', 'Africa', 'Africa South of the Sahara', 'Aftercare', 'Age-Months', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cauterize', 'Child', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer software', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Environment', 'Equipoise', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human Resources', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infection', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Neonatal', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Physicians', 'Postoperative Period', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-of-Life Assessment', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Safety', 'Science', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Shunt Device', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure of choroid plexus', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Uganda', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Ventriculostomy', 'Work', 'base', 'brain volume', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'deep learning', 'design', 'early childhood', 'evidence base', 'follow-up', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'patient subsets', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'research facility', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment strategy', 'trial comparing']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV HERSHEY MED CTR,R01,2018,10000,0.036471768223940174
"Imaging Biomarkers of Severe Respiratory Infections in Premature Infants ABSTRACT  Prematurity is the largest single cause of death in children under five in the world and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) are the top cause of hospitalization and mortality in premature infants. Clinical tools to predict and prevent severe LRTI in premature pediatric patients are critically needed to allow early interventions to decrease the high morbidity and mortality in this patient group. Although imaging biomarkers of lung disease from computed tomography have been successfully used in adults, they entail heightened risks for children due to cumulative radiation and the need for sedation. Our goal is to address these gaps and improve clinical practice by developing an objective imaging biomarker framework to assess the risk of severe respiratory disease in premature babies using non-invasive low-radiation X-ray imaging.  Previous efforts lead by Dr. Linguraru (Principal Investigator) at Children's National Health System (CNHS) have focused on developing technical components to quantify lung structural data from chest X-ray (CXR) in children. The image processing pipeline developed at CNHS integrates three novel technical components: a) automatic lung segmentation, b) obtrusive object removal in CXR, and c) severity quantification of lung pathology. These innovations enabled the development of a quantitative imaging software technology to quantify Lung Air trapping and Irregular opacities Radiological analyzer (LungAIR).  This Phase I project builds on the methodology developed in preliminary work. We will analyze a large database (n=200) of retrospective CXR images from premature infants with known clinical outcomes, and further develop and validate lung imaging biomarkers. In Specific Aim 1 we will design and implement a prototype of the software technology (LungAIR) for the localization and quantification of heterogeneous aeration patterns in each lung quadrant through quantitative imaging algorithms. A graphical user interface will also be developed for the simple clinical use of the technology. In Specific Aim 2 we will perform clinical outcome analysis to correlate these biomarkers with the severity of lung disease. We will also combine our new imaging biomarkers with clinical parameters to design and evaluate a predictive model of LRTI risk in the first year of life to optimize the clinical management and improve the outcomes for premature babies.  In this project, CNHS partners with Kitware to translate our research into a clinical software application and lay the groundwork for further developments and clinical studies in Phase II. In summary, our approach will enable better clinical management of diseases of prematurity leading to novel diagnostic strategies to improve treatment and outcomes for the highly vulnerable population of premature infants.

"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment. We propose a new portable motor rehabilitation system with social robotic interfaces that maximizes rehabilitation dosage. The project will provide insights into motor development in special needs children suggesting a new early intervention paradigm for children with motor disabilities.",SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation,9348402,R01HD087133,"['Adaptive Behaviors', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Delaware', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Visual', 'aged', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cognitive disability', 'computer game', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'educational atmosphere', 'equipment training', 'human-robot interaction', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'motor rehabilitation', 'neuromuscular', 'peer', 'personalized medicine', 'physical therapist', 'portability', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skeletal', 'social']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2017,477276,0.025302777481116947
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9384304,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opiates', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,704051,0.013344333052874574
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9324377,K02NS089852,"['2 year old', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early identification', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor deficit', 'motor impairment', 'neonatal brain', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2017,137131,0.03440083894496632
"High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks Project Summary Major theories of socioemotional development suggest that adaptive patterns of self-regulation reflect the accumulation of thousands of individual daily experiences of distress. In particular, parents’ efforts to regulate their infants’ distress are thought to provide critical inputs to developing self-regulation skills. Factors affecting caregiving, such as caregiver stress or mood disorders, are thought to limit parents’ ability to provide this early support. Thus, early-emerging patterns of mother-infant interaction are theorized to be an important mechanism by which mental health risks are transmitted from caregivers to their children. However, empirical evidence for these theories are scarce, as it has not been possible to systematically capture episodes of distress as they occur in day-to-day mother and infant activity. Additionally, most studies cannot disentangle complex interactions between infant and maternal psychobiological factors. For example, highly fussy infants are more likely to stress and overwhelm their parents, thereby likely affecting parental regulation efforts and potentially exacerbating their own early biological predispositions. Datasets capturing the details of daily interactions between mothers and their infants are needed to access the basic bio-behavioral mechanisms of developing psychopathology risk. In the future, such rich datasets could also provide a foundation for emerging “just in time” interventions that could provide mothers with real-time support and reassurance during day-to-day activities. To thus advance the field of developmental psychopathology, this proposal will leverage emerging “wearable” or mobile-sensor technologies to capture episodes of infant distress and subsequent maternal regulation efforts as they occur in the typical day-to-day activities of infants and their mothers. The research aims of this proposal are 1) to develop a mobile-sensing platform that will automatically detect detailed markers of mother-infant distress-related activity as participants go about their daily lives, captured via a synchronized suite of “wearable” physiology, audio and proximity sensors, and once validated, to use this platform to 2) investigate the daily mechanisms of maladaptive mother-infant interaction dynamics The training goals of this proposal are to 1) develop my expertise with state-of-the art computational tools to study mother-infant activity in the “wild”, allowing me unprecedented access to the dynamic processes of bio- behavioral development, and 2) to provide me the opportunity bridge my work to the domain of developmental psychopathology. The proposed K01 is thus a key step in my goal to develop a research program that can harness the rich dynamics of day-to-day activity to support theoretically-driven clinical innovations. Children of mothers with depression anxiety and stress are at increased risk for a range of maladaptive outcomes, including both internalizing and externalizing mental health disorders. The current training proposal will develop a state-of-the-art mobile sensor paradigm to capture high-density ecologically valid markers of mother-infant interactions—a key mechanism of the transmission of psychopathology from mothers to their children—and use this paradigm to examine how daily activity and exposures contribute to adaptive and maladaptive dynamics of mother-infant interaction.","High-density markers of mother-infant bio-behavioral activity ""in the wild"": Developing a mobile-sensing paradigm to examine transmission of mental health risks",9386536,K01MH111957,"['Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Caregiver Burden', 'Caregivers', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Distress', 'Ecosystem', 'Emerging Technologies', 'Emotional', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Human Development', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Social Interaction', 'Stress', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'biobehavior', 'caregiving', 'computerized tools', 'density', 'developmental psychology', 'discrete time', 'experience', 'high risk', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'maternal depression', 'novel marker', 'programs', 'psychobiologic', 'response', 'sensor', 'skills', 'social', 'stress disorder', 'theories', 'trait', 'transmission process']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",K01,2017,118352,0.037671952703136655
"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). If successful, the system will significantly improve clinical diagnosis, treatment and surgery for children with CSO disease.",A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery,9360750,R01DE027027,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Baptist Church', 'Behavior', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Tissue', 'Brain', 'Calvaria', 'Catalogs', 'Cephalic', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Congenital abnormal Synostosis', 'Craniosynostosis', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Deformity', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Family', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Hospitals', 'Imaging Device', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Joint structure of suture of skull', 'Life', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical sutures', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Training', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bone', 'bone aging', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cranium', 'experience', 'forest', 'image processing', 'imaging informatics', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'occipital bone', 'open source', 'premature', 'tool', 'vector', 'virtual']",NIDCR,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2017,372360,0.041380179420849234
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age Project Summary/Abstract The goal of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care is not just survival of preterm infants, but also intact neurodevelopment for these vulnerable patients. Many factors affect neurodevelopment. Identification of factors that are modifiable at a time point early enough to improve the developmental trajectory of an individual infant is needed. While preterm infants are discharged from the NICU with a certain developmental potential based on their gestational age and clinical course, socioeconomic status (SES) of the home environment can significantly alter the developmental trajectory. Poverty increases risk for neurodevelopmental deterioration, resulting in significant health disparities. The means by which poverty alters neurodevelopment are unknown. The microbiome is influenced by environment and in turn influences brain development. We hypothesize that that the microbiome is a biologic effector of the influence of SES and environment on neurodevelopment. This proposal will focus on two key time points at which the microbiome is exposed to significant environmental alteration – first 2 weeks of life in the NICU and 6-12 months of life in the home environment. Longitudinal clinical data, patient microbial samples, environmental data, and SES data will be collected on established cohorts of preterm infants from five institutions across the United States already investigating the intestinal microbiome of preterm infants. Neurodevelopmental exams will be performed to assess the functional outcome of school readiness. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that microbiome development influences neurodevelopment. Furthermore we will identify environmental factors associated with SES that influence the microbiome and thus neurodevelopmental outcomes. Strengths of this proposal include distinctive expertise of the interdisciplinary investigative team in neonatal care, neurodevelopment, microbiome analysis, bioinformatics, economics, and analysis of environmental features of the home environment. Advanced sequencing techniques, spatial analysis of environmental factors (geomapping), and economic modeling will be used to investigate the relationships among SES, environment, microbiome, and neurodevelopmental outcome to identify a time point and possible environmental or microbiome modification to improve outcomes. Beyond increasing social strategies, expanding effective learning models, and mitigating medical needs of at risk infants, understanding and promoting shifts in the microbiome could lead to improved understanding of health disparities and enable interventions to alter infant neurodevelopmental-trajectories in innovative ways. Project Narrative Preterm infants are at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome due to their degree of prematurity, hospital course, and home environment. This proposal will study the changes in the bacterial colonization patterns of the infants in the context of their home environment to identify a potentially modifiable factor that may influence brain development and thus school readiness for these vulnerable infants.",The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age,9355704,UG3OD023281,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'California', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Ecology', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Enteral Feeding', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Florida', 'Food', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human Milk', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infant formula', 'Inflammation', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poverty', 'Premature Infant', 'Readiness', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'base', 'built environment', 'cohort', 'course development', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'gut microbiome', 'health disparity', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'neonatal care', 'neurodevelopment', 'patient population', 'premature', 'professor', 'social', 'socioeconomics']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,UG3,2017,1679656,0.06924922731529694
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9397322,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hearing', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multitask', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'premature neonates', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,435809,0.0016045156709692523
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9349480,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA analysis', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbiology', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gene complementation', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2017,619708,0.055299157898797704
"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment. We propose a new portable motor rehabilitation system with social robotic interfaces that maximizes rehabilitation dosage. The project will provide insights into motor development in special needs children suggesting a new early intervention paradigm for children with motor disabilities.",SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation,9146176,R01HD087133,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Delaware', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Visual', 'Visual Motion', 'Weight', 'aged', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cognitive disability', 'computer game', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'educational atmosphere', 'equipment training', 'human-robot interaction', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'learned behavior', 'meetings', 'motor rehabilitation', 'neuromuscular', 'peer', 'personalized medicine', 'physical therapist', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skeletal', 'social', 'technology training']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2016,477724,0.025302777481116947
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited. This study is designed to improve our understanding of the alterations in brain function and structure that produce these deficits by using novel approaches to examine how magnetic resonance imaging data predicts early childhood outcomes. The goal is to identify imaging measures which identify preterm infants at risk for particular deficits, thereby allowing institution of timely therapies specific to each chid's needs and enabling larger research trials evaluating interventions designed to improve developmental outcomes in this vulnerable group.",PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY,9118361,K02NS089852,"['2 year old', '5 year old', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrum', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early identification', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evolution', 'Fostering', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Independent Scientist Award', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Language Disorders', 'Lead', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Structure', 'Survival Rate', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'career development', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor deficit', 'motor impairment', 'neonatal brain', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'research study', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter injury']",NINDS,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K02,2016,191131,0.03440083894496632

Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,9124921,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'dynamic system', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2016,504474,0.046872420392105235
"The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age Project Summary/Abstract The goal of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) care is not just survival of preterm infants, but also intact neurodevelopment for these vulnerable patients. Many factors affect neurodevelopment. Identification of factors that are modifiable at a time point early enough to improve the developmental trajectory of an individual infant is needed. While preterm infants are discharged from the NICU with a certain developmental potential based on their gestational age and clinical course, socioeconomic status (SES) of the home environment can significantly alter the developmental trajectory. Poverty increases risk for neurodevelopmental deterioration, resulting in significant health disparities. The means by which poverty alters neurodevelopment are unknown. The microbiome is influenced by environment and in turn influences brain development. We hypothesize that that the microbiome is a biologic effector of the influence of SES and environment on neurodevelopment. This proposal will focus on two key time points at which the microbiome is exposed to significant environmental alteration – first 2 weeks of life in the NICU and 6-12 months of life in the home environment. Longitudinal clinical data, patient microbial samples, environmental data, and SES data will be collected on established cohorts of preterm infants from five institutions across the United States already investigating the intestinal microbiome of preterm infants. Neurodevelopmental exams will be performed to assess the functional outcome of school readiness. The goal of this proposal is to demonstrate that microbiome development influences neurodevelopment. Furthermore we will identify environmental factors associated with SES that influence the microbiome and thus neurodevelopmental outcomes. Strengths of this proposal include distinctive expertise of the interdisciplinary investigative team in neonatal care, neurodevelopment, microbiome analysis, bioinformatics, economics, and analysis of environmental features of the home environment. Advanced sequencing techniques, spatial analysis of environmental factors (geomapping), and economic modeling will be used to investigate the relationships among SES, environment, microbiome, and neurodevelopmental outcome to identify a time point and possible environmental or microbiome modification to improve outcomes. Beyond increasing social strategies, expanding effective learning models, and mitigating medical needs of at risk infants, understanding and promoting shifts in the microbiome could lead to improved understanding of health disparities and enable interventions to alter infant neurodevelopmental-trajectories in innovative ways. Project Narrative Preterm infants are at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome due to their degree of prematurity, hospital course, and home environment. This proposal will study the changes in the bacterial colonization patterns of the infants in the context of their home environment to identify a potentially modifiable factor that may influence brain development and thus school readiness for these vulnerable infants.",The microbiome as a potential mediator of socio-economic disparities in preterm infant neurodevelopmental trajectories from NICU discharge to school age,9262661,UG3OD023281,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'California', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chicago', 'Child health care', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Ecology', 'Economic Models', 'Economics', 'Encephalitis', 'Enteral Feeding', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Event', 'Face', 'Florida', 'Food', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human Milk', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Intestines', 'Israel', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Factor', 'Premature Infant', 'Qualifying', 'Readiness', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'School-Age Population', 'Schools', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'built environment', 'cohort', 'course development', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'gut microbiome', 'health disparity', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in utero', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'neonatal care', 'neurodevelopment', 'patient population', 'premature', 'professor', 'social', 'socioeconomics']",OD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,UG3,2016,1661003,0.06924922731529694
"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,9067148,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'heart rate monitor', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature neonates', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,642962,0.027743908868205748
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,9134726,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,653525,0.055299157898797704
"Neural Systems For Infant Sensitivity to Phonological Rhythmic-Temporal Patterning No abstract available PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to understand how all infants discover the finite set of language units in their native language from the infinite combinations of sensory stimuli around them.

"SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation ﻿PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions}: According to the 2010 US census (http://www.census.gov/prod/2011 pubs/acsbr1 0-12. pdf) 2.8 million school-aged children (aged 5 to 17) suffer from some form of mental and/or physical disability. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) guarantees such children equal access to education. However, children aged 1 to 5, while even more in need of early rehabilitation therapy and social interaction, do not receive the same attention. This proposal describes a plan for developing a new paradigm for pediatric rehabilitation. The paradigm involves robots that interact socially with special needs children, within a closed feedback control loop. Its components include new methods for modeling and representation of children motion, visual activity recognition, machine learning and behavior adaptation, and general-sum game-theoretic analysis of human-robot interaction. The research groups in the two collaborating institutions, University of Delaware (UD) and Johns Hopkins University (JHU), have produced preliminary results and evidence which suggest that the envisioned technical innovations in the domains mentioned above are feasible, and that physical implementation is possible.  There are three intertwined research thrusts in the proposed activity, that address specific long-standing challenges in each area: 1. pediatric rehabilitation: develop a robot-assisted, pediatric rehabilitation environment which combines motor training with social interaction; 2. computer vision and perception: develop interpretable perception and machine learning algorithms for adaptive activity recognition; 3. robot control: develop the control and coordination algorithms to enable directed and purposeful human-robot interaction. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Each year, 10 000 infants in the U.S. develop cerebral palsy and 4 000 infants have birth defects of the spine and the brain. The motor delays for these infants have lifelong consequences. This gap in mobility is a significant secondary impairment. We propose a new portable motor rehabilitation system with social robotic interfaces that maximizes rehabilitation dosage. The project will provide insights into motor development in special needs children suggesting a new early intervention paradigm for children with motor disabilities.",SCH: GEAR - Grounded Early Adaptive Rehabilitation,9067563,R01HD087133,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Body part', 'Brain', 'Censuses', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Cognitive', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computers', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Dancing', 'Data', 'Delaware', 'Development', 'Disabled Persons', 'Early Intervention', 'Education', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Feedback', 'Friends', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Activities', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Perception', 'Physical activity', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Play', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'School-Age Population', 'Social Environment', 'Social Interaction', 'Socialization', 'Solutions', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Transducers', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Visual', 'Visual Motion', 'Weight', 'aged', 'base', 'catalyst', 'cognitive disability', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'disability', 'dosage', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'learned behavior', 'meetings', 'neuromuscular', 'peer', 'personalized medicine', 'robot assistance', 'skeletal', 'social']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF DELAWARE,R01,2015,503237,0.025302777481116947
"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population.

"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,8897409,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2015,521457,0.046872420392105235
"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8856234,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,614823,0.027743908868205748
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,8929222,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient absorption', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,645802,0.055299157898797704
"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.          This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.

"PREDICTING CHILDHOOD OUTCOMES IN PRETERM INFANTS USING CEREBRAL CONNECTIVITY     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Premature birth remains a major public health issue due to its continuing high incidence combined with the frequency of developmental impairments among surviving infants. In order to improve developmental outcomes in very preterm infants (VPT, born prior to 32 weeks' gestation), accurate and early identification of the alterations in brain development that lead to subsequent developmental impairment is required. The candidate for this K02 Independent Scientist Award is a uniquely trained pediatric neurologist who seeks to define the relationship between cerebral connectivity during infancy and childhood developmental outcomes. This project will involve a valuable, well-characterized VPT cohort (N=128) which includes high-risk children selected due to the presence of brain injury during the neonatal period. These children have undergone clinical characterization and MRI during the neonatal period and developmental assessment at age 2 years. They will now undergo standardized assessment of developmental outcomes at age 5 years. The central hypotheses are that VPT children will display a persisting range of motor and language difficulties, and that affected VPT children will display abnormalities on imaging measures obtained during infancy that predict childhood performance, both at the group and individual level, in these distinct and critical developmental domains. We propose to investigate these postulates by: 1) comprehensively evaluating childhood motor and language performance; 2) defining the relationship between alterations in domain-specific neonatal functional and structural connectivity and childhood motor and language outcomes; and 3) investigating differences in brain- wide cerebral connectivity in impaired VPT children using machine learning, pattern classification approach. The result will be characterization of the alterations in cerebral connectivity that underlie developmental disabilities in VPT children. In addition, we seek to develop highly valuable neuroimaging biomarkers that predict future motor and language impairment, enabling the provision of targeted care tailored to the needs of each individual infant. Finally, these tools will contribute to future, large-scale trials evaluating interventions designed to protect the developing brain. In pursuit of this goal, a focused career development program will complement the candidate's background in engineering and magnetic resonance methodology with training in developmental assessments and innovative image analysis approaches using applied mathematics, providing skills necessary to perform accurate longitudinal clinical research studies and develop individual prediction models. The supported activities will facilitate an NIH R-mechanism application centered upon innovative investigation of individual prediction models for developmental trajectories in VPT children during school-age, including repeat neuroimaging assessments during childhood. The culmination of these efforts will be transformative investigation that fosters improved outcomes for this high-risk population.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite continued high rates of disabilities in infants born prematurely, methods for accurately identifying those that would benefit most from specific therapies or protective interventions remain limited.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge.

"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,8711519,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional RNA', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2014,480422,0.046872420392105235
"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.                ",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8688242,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,602789,0.027743908868205748
"The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Intestinal tract disease is responsible for a substantial amount of the morbidity and mortality among people with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF). The manifestations of CF intestinal disease frequently occur during infancy and result from pancreatic exocrine insufficiency (PI), resulting in profound nutrient malabsorption and malnutrition, and consequently in growth failure and intestinal obstruction. Despite aggressive, early nutritional intervention with pancreatic enzyme replacement and other therapies, early growth failure remains common among infants with CF, suggesting that characteristics other than PI contribute to growth and nutritional failure in infants with CF. The identification of thes growth and nutritional determinants in children with CF therefore remains a key research goal in CF care. Recently, a clue to a potentially critical contributor to nutrient and energy uptake in children has emerged from the study of the microbes present in the gastrointestinal tract- the gut microbiota. Research has identified a complex relationship between gut microbiota, nutritional intake, nutrient absorption, and other health measures. GI tract microbes are known to contribute significantly to human nutrient metabolism and energy harvest, and they are altered in many disease states. Therefore, infant GI tract microbes may represent important determinants of CF nutritional outcomes, which in turn can significantly impact severity of lung disease and overall longevity. We recently showed that infants and children with CF had GI microbiota that differ markedly from those of children without CF, and that this dysbiosis correlated with severity of GI dysfunction. However, the relationships between CF GI microbiota with growth and other clinically important outcomes have not been studied. We hypothesize that the intestinal microbiomes among children with CF correlate with severity of malabsorption, intestinal inflammation, gastrointestinal signs and symptoms, vitamin and mineral deficiency, and nutritional status. To test these hypotheses, this ancillary study will define the fecal microbiomes of 250 infants with CF being enrolled in an ongoing multicenter study of infant nutrition (the Baby Observational NUtrition Study (BONUS), funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and the National Institutes of Health) using ultra high-throughput, culture-independent sequencing methods. With these resources, we will (1) define the fecal microbiomes, composed of the microbiota (the species of microbes present) and metagenomes (the microbial genes present, which reflects the metabolic capacity of the microbiota) of at least four stool samples per subject over the first year of life, and (2) determine the relationship of fecal microbiomes, and their evolution over the year of study, with nutritional and clinical parameters (including weight, height, body mass index, growth rate of each of these parameters among subjects, serum vitamin levels, fecal nutrient and metabolite content, GI symptoms, and measures of inflammation). We will use massively parallel next- generation DNA sequencing methods, combined with advanced bioinformatic analytical methods, with which we have extensive experience. Our goal is to define the role of the infant CF GI microbiome in growth and nutrition, with the hope of identifying interventions that will improve early growth, and thus long-term outcomes, in CF.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent scientific evidence suggests that the microbes that live in the gastrointestinal tracts of humans and other animals play key roles in the metabolism of nutrients, harvest of energy for the host, and the uptake of vitamins. Therefore, these microbes may be important contributors to diseases in which nutrients are poorly absorbed, the gastrointestinal tract is diseased, and/or the host grows poorly. The aim of this project is to determine the role of gastrointestinal microbes in the relentless and difficult-to-treat growth failure in children with the genetic disease cystic fibrosis, with the hope of both identifying interventions that will lead to better nutritional outcomes in these and in other children with poo early growth.            ",The relationship of fecal microbiomes and nutritional status in CF,8815576,R01DK095869,"['Address', 'Ancillary Study', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Antibiotic Therapy', 'Antibiotics', 'Bacteria', 'Bacterial Genes', 'Bacteroides', 'Bioinformatics', 'Body mass index', 'Breast Feeding', 'Carbohydrates', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Dietary intake', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Enrollment', 'Escherichia coli', 'Evolution', 'Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency', 'Failure', 'Fat-Soluble Vitamin', 'Fatty Acids', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Gastrointestinal tract structure', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Height', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Intestinal Diseases', 'Intestinal Obstruction', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Longevity', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Malabsorption Syndromes', 'Malnutrition', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Micronutrients', 'Minerals', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neonatal Screening', 'Nutrient', 'Nutritional', 'Nutritional Study', 'Nutritional status', 'Observational Study', 'Obstruction', 'Outcome', 'Pancreatic enzyme', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteobacteria', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Study models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visit', 'Vitamins', 'Volatile Fatty Acids', 'Weight', 'absorption', 'analytical method', 'aqueous', 'candidate marker', 'children with cystic fibrosis', 'design', 'dosage', 'early cystic fibrosis', 'enzyme replacement therapy', 'experience', 'gastrointestinal', 'gastrointestinal sign', 'gastrointestinal symptom', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant nutrition', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'mortality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'nutrient metabolism', 'nutrition', 'public health relevance', 'routine care', 'uptake']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,675943,0.055299157898797704
"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge.

"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.          This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.

In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms.

"Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Significance. Computational modeling is central to a rigorous understanding of the development of the child's first social relationships. The project will address this challenge by modeling longitudinal change in the dynamics of early social interactions. Modeling will integrate objective (automated) measurements of emotion and attention and common genetic variants relevant to those constructs.     Innovation. Objective measurement of behavior will involve the automated modeling and classification of the physical properties of communicative signals-such as facial expressions and vocalizations. Dynamic models of self-regulation and interactive influence during dyadic interaction will utilize precise measurements of expressive behavior as moderated by genetic markers associated with dopaminergic and serotonergic functioning. The interdisciplinary team includes investigators including from developmental and quantitative psychology, genetics, affective computing, computer vision, and physics who model dynamic interactive processes at a variety of time scales.     Approach. Infant-mother interaction, its perturbation, and its development, will be investigated using the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. Facial modeling, head, and arm/hand modeling will be used to conduct objective measurements of a multimodal suite of interactive behaviors including facial expression, gaze direction, head movement, tickling, and vocalization. Models will be trained and evaluated with respect to expert coding and non-experts' perceptions of emotional valence constructs. Dynamic approaches to time-series modeling will focus on the development of self-regulation and interactive influence. Inverse optimal control modeling will be used to infer infant and mother preferences for particular dyadic states given observed patterns of behavior. The context-dependence of these parameters will be assessed with respect to the perturbation introduced by the still-face (a brief period of investigator-requested adult non-responsivity). Individual differences in infant and mother behavioral parameters will be modeled with respect to genetic indices of infant and mother dopaminergic and serotonergic function. Modeling algorithms, measurement software, and coded recordings will be shared with the scientific community to catalyze progress in the understanding of behavioral systems. These efforts will increase understanding of pathways to healthy cognitive and socio-emotional development, and shed light on the potential for change that will inform early intervention efforts.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     The modeling of early infant-parent relationships is central to a rigorous quantitative understanding of social development. Objective measurements of communicative behavior and related genetic markers in infant and mother will be used to model the development of self- regulation and interactive influence as they develop longitudinally. Genetically informed modeling of the infant-mother interactive system will produce a rigorous understanding of parameters that describe the diversity of early developmental pathways and potential psychopathological deviations from those pathways.                ",Modeling the Dynamics of Early Communication and Development,8452565,R01GM105004,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Child Development', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Face', 'Facial Expression', 'Functional RNA', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Hand', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Joints', 'Light', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metaphor', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Parents', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Psychology', 'Research Personnel', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Development', 'Social Interaction', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'arm', 'behavior measurement', 'dyadic interaction', 'gaze', 'genetic variant', 'indexing', 'infant monitoring', 'innovation', 'insight', 'model development', 'multilevel analysis', 'physical property', 'preference', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'social', 'social skills', 'vocalization']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R01,2013,571955,0.046872420392105235
"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.                ",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8509448,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,650062,0.027743908868205748
"Optimal neural and behavioral markers for learning to learn during infancy     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Human infants are confronted with a complex world that is filled with ambiguity. Not only are many different features and dimensions of information present in the environment, but these cues are often unrelated to any reinforcement or feedback. There are two solutions to learning in a complex and ambiguous environment: (a) innate constraints on the cues selected for processing (bottom-up), or (b) rapid learning-to-learn mechanisms that assess cues (top-down). Learned top-down mechanisms of information selection may be tuned more to specific task demands, and thus more useful for learning. Given how much infants have to learn over the first two years of life, it is not efficient to use mainly slow but precise (top-down) search methods. My hypothesis is that the developmental progression of learning how to learn requires using bottom-up information in a systematic way, while creating top-down buffers against bottom- up distraction. The experiments in the research plan will test this hypothesis, with each experiment evaluating an additional level of learning. Sophisticated behavioral techniques (i.e., both table- and head-mounted eye- tracking) and complementary state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods (i.e., functional near-infrared spectroscopy [fNIRS], measuring spatially-localized neural activation via non-invasive light probes on the scalp), as well as data mining tools applied to infant eye movement data, will examine how infants learn to learn from both computer displays and in naturalistic settings.  There are four specific aims in this research program: 1) to establish a new, robust measure of learning with both behavioral and neural measures, 2) to investigate how attentional deployment can optimally improve learning, 3) to apply the learning paradigm to the natural environment, and 4) to conduct microanalyses on and to develop computational models of infant eye movements. The training component focuses on learning to use two state-of-the-art methods in infancy research (a head-mounted eye-tracker and fNIRS), and learning to use innovative data mining tools to analyze patterns of infant eye movements to link looking behavior to cognitive abilities. This training program is essential for the applicant's career goal of identifying the optimal strategies for learning to learn that will lead to training regimens for populations with learning difficulties.  The findings will benefit researchers within the larger community of developmental science, as well as artificial intelligence, perceptual learning, education, animal learning, machine learning, and evolutionary psychology. This work will contribute to a foundational understanding of the dynamics of selective attention and learning in typical development, which in turn would inform populations with learning difficulties.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This multi-disciplinary research program will indicate signatures of optimal attentional deployment for efficient learning among distractions via converging evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging methods and data mining tools.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning. We propose a multi-component model of development in which infants bootstrap simple preferences and associations into complex beliefs and attitudes.

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program.

"The origin and significance of appearance-based stereotypes.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research program examines the origins, consequences, and significance of appearance-based stereotypes. One goal is to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying the development of the universal preferences shown by infants, children, and adults for attractive faces. Why do even young infants prefer to look at attractive rather than unattractive faces and when do stereotypical expectations become attached to these visual preferences? By what processes do infants come to associate attractiveness with positive attributes and to associate unattractiveness with negative attributes? Given infants as young as 12 months of age display differential treatment of attractive and unattractive individuals they may have some primitive knowledge of appearance-based stereotypes much earlier than previously assumed. A second goal of the research is to form a better understanding of the consequences of appearance- based stereotypes. How do children behave toward others based on appearance? Do non-prototypical faces elicit negative affect from perceivers and, if so, how might this lead to stigmatization? What are the social, physical, and mental health risks associated with appearance-based stereotypes? Because the intent of this research is to provide a full understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of preferences, attitudes, and stereotypes based on facial appearance, a multi- method, converging evidence approach, beginning in infancy is required. This project includes standard behavioral measures widely used in the developmental literature including infant looking behavior with physiological measures (EEG, ERP, & EMG). Physiological data (e.g. EEG recorded brain activity) will be correlated with a behavioral response and/or a measure of attitudes. The ultimate goal of this research will be to ameliorate the negative consequences associated with appearance-based stereotypes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Rudimentary stereotypes are the result of three innate information-processing mechanisms: Cognitive averaging, categorization, and statistical learning.

"Improving Prematurity-related Respiratory Outcomes at Vanderbilt (IMPROV)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm birth is associated with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a form of chronic lung disease that impacts the pulmonary and overall health of more than 10,000 infants in the US each year. The long-term objective of this Clinical Research Center (CRC) is translation of biochemical, genetic and bioinformatics research into innovative interventions that improve outcomes of extremely preterm infants at risk for long- term pulmonary morbidity. Our proposal focuses specifically on the urea cycle-nitric oxide (UC-NO) and glutathione (GSH) pathways as pivotal and interrelated mechanisms in the response of the developing lung to the extrauterine environment. Overall hypotheses: (1) Biochemical immaturity and functional genetic variation in the UC-NO and GSH pathways modulate the BPD phenotype spectrum; (2) The duration and degree of NO insufficiency and free radical excess predicts BPD severity and correlates with pulmonary morbidity after NICU discharge. To investigate our hypothesis, our CRC will enroll 250 infants with birthweights 510-1250 grams and follow the survivors through 1 year of life. Our hypothesis invokes an immature hepatic and gut synthetic capacity to make citrulline and GSH, functional genetic variations in the UC-NO and GSH pathways, nutritional deficiencies and the physiologic and environmental stress of preterm birth. The resultant NO deficiency and free radical excess alters pulmonary vascular and alveolar development. Our biomarker discovery concept includes (a) collection of plasma, urine, red blood cells, DNA and tracheal aspirates for measurements of NO and GSH precursor sufficiency, production of NO metabolites and GSH, functional genetic variants in these pathways, and biomarkers of in vivo oxidative stress and (b) validation of these biomarkers for diagnosis and long term prognosis of patients with BPD. A bioinformatics approach using machine learning and predictive modeling has been developed for respiratory phenotyping and risk stratification at 36 weeks and 40 weeks postmenstrual age and at 12 months after hospital discharge. Accomplishment of these goals will promote novel clinical trials design to test new therapies to prevent BPD and improve long term pulmonary health of infants born preterm.

"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus.

We recently developed a machine-learned model (an Artificial Neural Network, ANN) to assist in decision- making regarding extubation of premature newborns (Mueller et al., 2004, 2006). The ANN model was found to perform with accuracy comparable to that of experienced clinicians; however, this approach needs to be compared to equally powerful machine-learning approaches before it can be evaluated in clinical practice. An appropriately validated decision-support tool could help in reducing the number of days a premature infant spends on a mechanical ventilator, and hence the risk of developing short and long-term side effects of mechanical ventilation, resulting in a corresponding decrease in overall health care costs.    In this R21 proposal, we will use several machine-learning approaches combined as a committee formation to obtain the best prediction of extubation success for a given infant. Further, we will build on the previously developed ANN prototype to create an enhanced decision support tool by developing data representation, storage, management, and most important, causal inference, which will enable effective integration of the resulting web-based decision-support tool with clinical practice. This last feature is only possible due to the integrated nature of the proponents themselves, which range from data structure and mathematical modeling experts to experienced neonatologists with a well established working relationship. The proposed effort aims at using advanced modeling tools for translational research by developing a web-based decision-support tool to aid primarily inexperienced clinicians in their decision-making and by promoting interoperability and data exchange among researchers in this field. The critical feature of this infrastructure is its web-based nature, which enables clinicians to evaluate a predictor's accuracy and parametric sensitivity individually for each neonate without having to use any other software than a web-browser. Such a prediction model will be of critical value not only to increase overall clinical accuracy but also to identify effective measures of validity of the original predictions.    The overall aim of this study is to develop a high performing web-based prediction system to use as a decision-support tool in clinical practice and to promote interoperability, and thus, data sharing and interaction among researchers in the neonatal community.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Predicting extubation outcome in premature infants on mechanical ventilators remains a challenging task even for experienced clinicians. In the proposed work, we aim to provide a sophisticated web-based tool that uses a machine-learning committee comprised of artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), naive Bayesian classifiers (NBC), influence diagrams (ID), boosted decision trees (BDT) and multivariable logistic regression (MLR) to assist primarily inexperienced clinicians in the decision-making. For the implementation of this tool we propose to develop an XML schema and RDFS model that can promote interoperability, and thus, data sharing and interaction among researchers in the neonatal community.          n/a",Decision Support in the Care of Preterm Newborns-Tool Development,7665362,R21HL090598,"['Adverse effects', 'Arts', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Committee Members', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Decision Making', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Evaluation', 'Extensible Markup Language', 'Health Care Costs', 'Infant', 'Information Resources Management', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical Ventilators', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Newborn Infant', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Premature Infant', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'System', 'Translational Research', 'Ventilator', 'Work', 'caregiving', 'clinical practice', 'data exchange', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'data structure', 'experience', 'interoperability', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'neonate', 'premature', 'prototype', 'public health relevance', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'routine care', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web based interface']",NHLBI,MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA,R21,2009,185389,0.03413424939900191
"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program. The proposed BRP will be lead by Drs. De Luca, Roy, and Adam, key personnel from Boston University (BU) with expertise in biomedical engineering and EMG system development.

"Sequence Induction in Infancy: A systematic approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thirteen experiments investigate the early development of the ability to learn patterns in sequential input. Such evidence would seem likely to provide a substantial contribution to our knowledge of how infants identify both concrete and abstract patterns, a fundamental aspect of cognitive development. The proposed experiments are organized into three broad studies. In the first study, we will examine ""ancillary"" factors that may influence sequence learning in infancy. We emphasize the importance of two kinds of relations between elements in any multi-element group or string: itemwise relations, between specific instances (e.g., statistical learning), and variablewise relations, between algebraic placeholders (e.g., abstract pattern or rule learning). We argue that a first step toward any programmatic series of experiments on these kinds of learning-must involve an understanding of processing limitations that may constrain performance. In the second study, we will investigate the different kinds of patterns infants may be able to learn, using past and pilot data as a guide for our theorizing. In the final study, we will explore the intriguing possibility that infants may learn more than one pattern in any single set of inputs, a classic question that has received little empirical attention in the literature on cognitive development. The short-term objectives of the present proposal are to elucidate fundamental developmental mechanisms in the ability to detect abstract visual and auditory structure. The long-term goals are to shed light on the larger question of how knowledge is acquired and structured in the human, how perceptual skills impact knowledge acquisition and structure, and how to best characterize early development.

"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results. A dissemination plan is included to make this technology available to the Motor Control community. Commercialization will be realized through Altec Inc. This technology will enable researchers in the fields of Motor Control, Aging, Exercise Physiology, Space Medicine, and Ergonomics, where it is of interest to understand how the CNS controls muscles, and how that control is altered as a consequence of aging, exercise, exposure to microgravity, fatigue, and excessive and prolonged force production.

"Early Detection of Keratoconus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Keratoconus is the most common degenerative disease affecting the cornea. This condition tends to develop around puberty and to progress over the next few decades, but its clinical history can be quite variable. As keratoconus develops, the cornea thins and bulges. Eventually, a corneal transplant may be needed to maintain vision. In its earliest stages, the disease is particularly difficult to detect, even using state-of-the-art diagnostic techniques such as anterior/posterior surface topography. This is of great importance to the corneal refractive surgeon because surgical treatment of an occult keratoconic cornea will weaken it and greatly accelerate the occurrence of symptoms. Because of the difficulty in differentiating early keratoconus from atypical normal corneas, many normal eyes deemed 'suspicious' are denied treatment. At the same time, some keratoconic eyes are missed and operated upon, with disastrous consequences. Early detection of keratoconus may also benefit patients because of the recent development of methods for strengthening the corneal stroma and preventing disease progression. We have developed a technique based on the use of high resolution ultrasound for imaging the cornea and measuring the thickness of its component layers, including the epithelium (about 50 microns in thickness) and the stroma (about 500 microns in thickness). We have shown that the epithelium, which is the surface layer of the cornea, will remodel itself to smooth out underlying irregularities. In early keratoconus, as the anterior stromal surface begins to bulge forward, the epithelium will thin above the apex of the bulge and thicken around it, to maintain a smooth anterior surface. This compensatory mechanism prevents anterior surface topography from detecting keratoconus in its early stages. We have also developed methods for characterizing the elastic properties of the cornea by inducing and measuring surface displacements in response to a pulse of acoustic radiation force. We will further develop and test this technique and apply it clinically in conjunction with the Ocular Response Analyzer, an instrument that causes a similar effect by use of an air pressure pulse. This proposal will involve analysis of topographic and pachymetric patterns and elastic properties in normal, keratoconus and keratoconus-suspicious eyes. We will develop an index based on multivariate analysis of these patterns based on unambiguously classified cases, and validate the risk index on suspicious cases based on clinical documentation of disease progression. Our goal is to reduce the percentage of screened cases deemed keratoconus- suspicious by at least a factor of two by allowing an unambiguous diagnosis of early keratoconus. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision. Early detection, which is not possible with current technology, would allow early treatment and prevent sever damage to KC corneas inadvertently operated upon for correction of vision. Our aim is to combine measurements of corneal elasticity, topography and epithelial thickness to develop means for early detection of KC.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Keratoconus (KC) is a corneal dystrophy will in many cases ultimately require corneal transplantation to maintain vision.

"Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to continue the development of an automatic system that will accurately and quickly decompose electromyographic (EMG) signals into their constituent action potentials and provide the timing of every firing of a set of concurrently active motor units. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system. We will improve the performance of the decomposition algorithms by incorporating new Artificial Intelligence concepts, and a new multi-strategy Hidden Markov Model (HMM) processing stage, to address signal decomposition challenges that cannot be met by the present technology. We will improve the present accuracy from typically 85% for 8 concurrently active motor units to greater than 96% for up to 15 concurrently active motor units. We will also design and build the hardware and software for a stand-alone portable system that may be used in the laboratory or clinic. Then we will transfer the system to a manufacturer for commercialization. In so doing we will produce, for the first time, an advanced system for conveniently and accurately obtaining the firings of a large group of concurrently active motor units from an EMG signal. The new technology will be tested in two applied studies that will be carried out concurrently with the technical developments. One will investigate neural modifications in the firing characteristics of motor units as a function of aging and physical activity. The other will investigate the mitigating effects of resistive exercise on age-related neural adaptations, culminating in the development of a clinical marker to estimate the likelihood that an elderly individual will benefit from an exercise program. The proposed BRP will be lead by Drs. De Luca, Roy, and Adam, key personnel from Boston University (BU) with expertise in biomedical engineering and EMG system development. Signal processing/software development will be provided by the leadership from Dr. Nawab through BU's Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Clinical expertise on aging/motor control will be provided by Dr. Novak, from The Department of Neurology at BU School of Medicine, and through Dr. Wolf, from the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta           n/a",Harnessing Motoneuron Activity: From Lab to Clinic,7236418,R01HD050111,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Boston', 'Characteristics', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Computer Systems Development', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Elderly', 'Electrodes', 'Engineering', 'Exercise', 'Fire - disasters', 'Human Resources', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motor', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neurology', 'Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Process', 'Range', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Universities', 'Wolves', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'age related', 'commercialization', 'computerized data processing', 'concept', 'design', 'improved', 'markov model', 'mathematical model', 'medical schools', 'motor control', 'neuroadaptation', 'neuromuscular system', 'new technology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'software development']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2007,557233,0.02537556190021069
"Sequence Induction in Infancy: A systematic approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Thirteen experiments investigate the early development of the ability to learn patterns in sequential input. Such evidence would seem likely to provide a substantial contribution to our knowledge of how infants identify both concrete and abstract patterns, a fundamental aspect of cognitive development. The proposed experiments are organized into three broad studies. In the first study, we will examine ""ancillary"" factors that may influence sequence learning in infancy. We emphasize the importance of two kinds of relations between elements in any multi-element group or string: itemwise relations, between specific instances (e.g., statistical learning), and variablewise relations, between algebraic placeholders (e.g., abstract pattern or rule learning). We argue that a first step toward any programmatic series of experiments on these kinds of learning-must involve an understanding of processing limitations that may constrain performance. In the second study, we will investigate the different kinds of patterns infants may be able to learn, using past and pilot data as a guide for our theorizing. In the final study, we will explore the intriguing possibility that infants may learn more than one pattern in any single set of inputs, a classic question that has received little empirical attention in the literature on cognitive development. The short-term objectives of the present proposal are to elucidate fundamental developmental mechanisms in the ability to detect abstract visual and auditory structure. The long-term goals are to shed light on the larger question of how knowledge is acquired and structured in the human, how perceptual skills impact knowledge acquisition and structure, and how to best characterize early development. In the future, such understanding may aid in the formulation of diagnostics and treatments for some developmental disorders.           n/a",Sequence Induction in Infancy: A systematic approach,7251991,R01HD048733,"['Address', 'Age', 'Attention', 'Auditory', 'Be++ element', 'Beds', 'Beryllium', 'Body of uterus', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Compatible', 'Conceptual Domain', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Count', 'Data', 'Dependency', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Drug Formulations', 'Elements', 'Fostering', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Human', 'Indium', 'Infant', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Language Development', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medial', 'Nature', 'Numbers', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Range', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Schools', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Vegetables', 'Visual', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'age related', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'coping', 'developmental disease', 'infancy', 'neglect', 'object perception', 'postnatal', 'research study', 'sequence learning', 'size', 'skills']",NICHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,304197,0.014259653279534903
"Non-Invasive System for Identifying Neural Behavior    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for ""Neurotechnology Research, Development, and Enhancement"" (PA-04-006) proposes the development of innovative technologies, methodologies, and instrumentation to advance our understanding of neural control mechanisms of muscle force production through a non-invasive means of recording neuronal firing patterns. The project will develop an automatic system to accurately and quickly decompose the surface Electromyographic (sEMG) signal into its constituent action potentials and provide the timing of the firings of concurrently active motor units. The goal is to achieve an accuracy of >85% in the automatic mode and >96% with the assistance of an interactive editor. This information will enable a wide range of studies to investigate the workings of the healthy and diseased neuromuscular system by simply placing a sensor above a muscle with no assault to the CNS. The sEMG Decomposition System will replace existing technology that relies on invasive procedures to detect the EMG signal through needle or fine-wire electrodes. The proposed work includes: 1) mathematical modeling and empirical studies to develop a sEMG electrode array that maximizes shape differences of motor unit firings and thereby facilitates sEMG signal decomposition; 2) algorithm development using artificial intelligence technology of our own design combined with Principal Component Analysis techniques; and 3) data acquisition/processing software and hardware to build a portable prototype surface decomposition system. Performance testing of the system will be conducted using data collection experiments to ensure that the system is comparable in motor unit yield, processing speed, and accuracy to the current state-of-the art indwelling decomposition system. We will also prove that the signal decomposition is performed correctly by decomposing two separately collected signals and matching the results.

"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.

"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks. The proposed studies therefore         represent the ability to study information processing of the cerebellum using        quite tractable motor behaviors and then to apply that information to more           complex cognitive processes. Thus, these studies will provide a basic                understanding of information processing for important aspects of the motor           system, and could provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of the           neural basis of information processing that is applied to cognitive properties       as well.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning,6889075,R01MH057051,"['artificial intelligence', 'behavioral /social science research tag', 'behavioral extinction', 'biological models', 'brain electronic stimulator', 'cerebellar Purkinje cell', 'cerebellar nuclei', 'cerebellum', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer simulation', 'electrophysiology', 'eye movements', 'laboratory rabbit', 'learning', 'microelectrodes', 'neural information processing', 'neural plasticity', 'neural transmission', 'neurons', 'operant conditionings', 'psychomotor function', 'reflex', 'statistics /biometry', 'stimulus /response', 'synapses']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2005,222750,0.021572433079088488

The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability. Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team. As part of this               application the enhanced system will be used in two laboratory studies and two       clinical studies. The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution. The clinical           studies will address the use of the device in quantifying the degree of              denervation in paralyzed laryngeal muscles and in studying the effect of acute       ataxia on the firing characteristics of the motorneurons in cerebellar stroke.

"Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this project is to develop data mining and artificial intelligence systems to recognize the presence and severity of motor fluctuations in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Such a system would be valuable both for the clinical management of patients as well as for the conduct of trials of new treatments for PD. We hypothesize that movement disorders that accompany late-stage PD will present with identifiable and predictable features that can be derived from surface electromyographic (EMG) and accelerometer (ACC) signals recorded during the execution of a standardized set of motor assessment tasks.      In the first phase of the project (R21) we will explore motor patterns associated with motor states (OFF, ON, DYSKINETIC). We will design methods that rely on data mining visualization techniques and vector quantization-projection algorithms for the identification of data clusters. Successful accomplishment of this exploratory phase will be followed by an R33 Phase in which we will develop a neuro-fuzzy system to provide clinical scores from automated analysis of the EMG and ACC features. Furthermore, we will perform a thorough analysis of motor pattems expressing the full complement of movement disorders associated with PD using fuzzy ARTMAP techniques. The approach will enable us to integrate clinical information into the quantitative EMG/ACC data analysis for the purpose of increasing our ability to identify the motor patterns associated with these disorders. Finally, Parkinsonian patients with motor fluctuations will be monitored before and after adjustment of their medications to assess the sensitivity of the technique to changes in the motor fluctuation patterns.       Although this project focuses on a specific clinical application requiring advanced analysis techniques, the approach can be generalized to numerous applications in which data mining and other methods developed in this project can be used to analyze large data sets recorded using wearable sensors. n/a",Data Mining to Identify Motor Fluctuations in PD,6792043,R21NS045410,"['Parkinson&apos', 's disease', 'abnormal involuntary movement', 'clinical research', 'computer data analysis', 'electromyography', 'human subject', 'method development', 'neuromuscular disorder', 'psychomotor function', 'tremor']",NINDS,SPAULDING REHABILITATION HOSPITAL,R21,2004,153537,-0.011925930414667928

The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability.

The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution.

"Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning   DESCRIPTION:(from applicant's abstract):                                                                                                 The long-term goal of this project is to understand the cerebellum well enough       to build a computer simulation that emulates its function. Several fortuitous        features of the cerebellum make it especially amenable to analysis using             large-scale, bottom-up computer simulations. The objectives of these                 simulations is to make our understanding of the cerebellum expressible at the        level of information processing: what the cerebellum processes and how. The          specific aims build on previous work using the particular advantages of              Pavlovian eyelid conditioning to build and test biologically detailed and            accurate computer simulations of the cerebellum. The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks.

"Predicting life-threatening events in CHIME infant data  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the sudden death of an infant under one year old without any apparent warning signs.  It is the leading cause of death of infants between the age of one month and one year in the developed countries. Previous studies have indicated that SIDS victims may suffer from cardiorespiratory failure, which reflects immaturity of autonomic nervous system (ANS) control. Heart variability (HRV) has been shown to be a noninvasive and inexpensive way to assess the ANS. Increased heart rate and decreased heart rate variability have been observed in SIDS victims. While it is unclear whether there is a relationship between SIDS and infants who have apparent life-threatening events (ALTE) like apnea and bradycardia, there is a desire to gain a better understanding of the nature of ALTE, their frequency and severity, and the ability of home monitors to detect events and provide an alarm. The Collaborative Home Infant Monitoring Evaluation (CHIME) study group, formed by NIH, sought to study these issues through the collection of a massive clinical database, which includes physiological, signals from 529 infants recorded in polysomnographic (PSG) studies. The infants were then studied several months using a home monitor which recorded life-threatening events. A classification is available regarding which infants had verified, apparent life-threatening events. Given the wealth of information linking SIDS and heart rate variability (HRV), we desire to investigate whether heart rate variability is effective predictor for life-threatening events. This research will investigate whether HRV can differentiate infants at risk for future apparent life-threatening events (FALTE). First statistical methods will be used to determine if there is significant difference in HRV between normal and FALTE infant groups. Next, the major goal is to design a method to classify infants using HRV, exploring various prediction models including logistic regression, decision tree, and neural networks. The relationship between HRV parameters and all the affected factors will also be studied to provide a clearer understanding of the parameters, and to help determine how to use HRV as a classifier. Successful prediction of infants with future apparent life-threatening events could have clinical significance and provide physicians with an opportunity for treatment.   n/a",Predicting life-threatening events in CHIME infant data,6619652,R03HD042479,"['apnea', ' autonomic nervous system', ' bradycardia', ' clinical research', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk', ' heart rate', ' human data', ' infant human (0-1 year)', ' mathematical model', ' model design /development', ' patient monitoring device', ' polysomnography', ' statistics /biometry', ' sudden infant death syndrome']",NICHD,CLARKSON UNIVERSITY,R03,2003,78500,0.07561989756756222

The studies of this project         will follow a two-pronged approach: capabilities of the simulations will be          used as the basis for empirical studies that test underlying mechanisms              predicted by the simulations, shortcomings of the simulations will be used as        the basis for further development of the simulations. Specific hypotheses will       be pursued as to how the addition of specific biological features will               alleviate specific shortcomings. In this way the simulations permit a                systematic structure-function analysis of cerebellar mechanisms that operate         during motor learning. The use of eyelid conditioning as the                         cerebellar-dependent behavior that the simulations must accomplish provides a        rich repertoire of behavioral properties to challenge the simulations and makes      the connections the between the simulations and empirical tests of its               predictions quite tight. The completion of these studies will provide a              relatively clear picture of the basic mechanisms that operate in the cerebellum      during learning and adaptation of movements. This should have important future       implications for those afflicted with cerebellar damage or degenerative              pathologies. In addition, mounting evidence suggests that certain parts of the       human cerebellum are involved in non-motor, cognitive process. Since the             synaptic organization of these regions and those involved in motor learning do       not appear to differ, the cerebellum must contribute the same information            processing to both motor and cognitive tasks. The proposed studies therefore         represent the ability to study information processing of the cerebellum using        quite tractable motor behaviors and then to apply that information to more           complex cognitive processes. Thus, these studies will provide a basic                understanding of information processing for important aspects of the motor           system, and could provide the foundation for a deeper understanding of the           neural basis of information processing that is applied to cognitive properties       as well.                                                                                                                                                                  n/a",Computational analysis of cerebellar motor learning,6327522,R01MH057051,"['artificial intelligence', ' behavioral /social science research tag', ' behavioral extinction', ' biological models', ' brain electronic stimulator', ' cerebellar Purkinje cell', ' cerebellar nuclei', ' cerebellum', ' computational neuroscience', ' computer simulation', ' electrophysiology', ' eye movements', ' laboratory rabbit', ' learning', ' microelectrodes', ' neural information processing', ' neural plasticity', ' neural transmission', ' neurons', ' operant conditionings', ' psychomotor function', ' reflex', ' statistics /biometry', ' stimulus /response', ' synapses']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2001,249250,0.021572433079088488
"HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the applicant's abstract): This study will develop an                                                                             automatic system for decomposing the electromyographic signal into the               constituent action potentials corresponding to the firing of individual motor        units activated by motorneurons. The system will be an enhancement of a current      system used over the past 20 years in many studies carried out by the                Neuromuscular Research Lab at Boston University. Although the current system         has been a valuable research tool, it has never been useful as a clinical tool       due to limitations in processing time, accuracy and portability. Proposed            enhancements will be introduced by redesigning the hardware and rewriting the        decomposition software using a knowledge-based artificial intelligence language      (IPUS), which has recently been developed by the team. As part of this               application the enhanced system will be used in two laboratory studies and two       clinical studies. The laboratory studies will investigate the modifications          that occur in the firing of motor units as a function of ageing and will             quantify the benefits that can be restored by exercise. The system will also be      used to investigate the phenomena of motor unit substitution. The clinical           studies will address the use of the device in quantifying the degree of              denervation in paralyzed laryngeal muscles and in studying the effect of acute       ataxia on the firing characteristics of the motorneurons in cerebellar stroke.       As well as testing specific hypotheses, these studies will be used to test and       improve the evolving design of the new decomposition system.                                                                                                              n/a",HARNESSING MOTONEURON ACTIVITY: FROM LAB TO CLINIC,6054979,R24HD038585,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioengineering /biomedical engineering', ' biological signal transduction', ' biomedical automation', ' biomedical equipment development', ' clinical research', ' electromyography', ' evaluation /testing', ' human subject', ' motor neurons', ' neuromuscular function']",NICHD,BOSTON UNIVERSITY,R24,2000,593340,0.012010974795591555
"Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning RESEARCH SUMMARY The goal of this award is to provide Andrew Beam, PhD with research support and comprehensive mentoring designed to transition him to an independent investigator in perinatal and neonatal informatics. Preterm labor (PTL) is labor which occurs before 37 weeks of gestation and carries with it enormous health and financial consequences. Preterm infants have some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity, yet machine-learning techniques for these important outcomes remains under developed. The research strategy is focused developing predictive models for two very important clinical scenarios using large sources of existing healthcare data. The focus of Specific Aim 1 develops a new form of machine learning known as deep learning for predicting PTL in pregnant women, while the focus of Specific Aim 2 investigates the use of deep learning for predicting clinical trajectories of preterm infants in the NICU. Currently, management and anticipation of both clinical scenarios is challenging and advancement in our predictive capacity could dramatically improve the quality and efficiency of the healthcare system. These models will be built using an existing database of 50 million patient-lives obtained through a partnership with a major US health insurer. Specific Aim 3 seeks to understand how the models constructed using this unique data resource translate and generalize to data from the electronic health records of Boston-area hospitals, which is a key concern for all healthcare data scientists. The education plan focuses on augmenting Dr. Beam’s graduate degrees in statistics and bioinformatics with additional training in clinical medicine and human pathology. This additional education will grant Dr. Beam a deeper understanding of the clinical problems faced by these populations and will allow for more fluid collaborations with clinicians in the future. The composition of Dr. Beam’s mentorship committee, which includes expertise in neonatology, biostatistics, and translational informatics, reflects his long-term desire to be quantitative scientist who works side-by-side practicing physicians so that quantitative research is translated into impactful clinical practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE Infants born prematurely experience some of the highest levels of pulmonary and cardiac morbidity and are among the most expensive patients in all of pediatrics. Now, with the availability of large sources of healthcare data from insurance claims databases and electronic health records, there is an opportunity to better understand prematurity and its predictors using computational techniques. We propose leveraging state of the art deep learning models built using data from hospitals and insurers to both predict which pregnancies will result in preterm birth and to predict which preterm infants will experience severe cardiac and pulmonary morbidity.",Predicting Pulmonary and Cardiac Morbidity in Preterm Infants with Deep Learning,9850130,K01HL141771,"['37 weeks gestation', 'Accounting', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Boston', 'Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia', 'Cardiac', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Collaborations', 'Computational Technique', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Graduate Degree', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Human Pathology', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Insurance Carriers', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neonatology', 'Outcome', 'Patent Ductus Arteriosus', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Perinatal', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Premature Labor', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Scientist', 'Sepsis', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Teaching Hospitals', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Update', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'data resource', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'education planning', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'improved', 'insurance claims', 'mortality', 'peer', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prognostic', 'respiratory distress syndrome', 'social', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'structured data']",NHLBI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2020,166320,0.02171086209121157
"MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants Project Summary/Abstract About 100,000 very preterm infants (VPI; ≤32 weeks gestational age) are born every year in the United States. Up to 35% develop noteworthy neurodevelopmental deficits, thereby increasing their risk for poor educational, health, and social outcomes. Unfortunately, neurodevelopmental deficits cannot currently be reliably diagnosed until 3 to 5 years of age. The imminent challenge lies in early identification of infants that are more likely to develop later deficits. Advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and deep learning (DL) provide means to address this challenge. Application of DL to infant brain MRI data can open up new windows into early prediction of neurodevelopmental outcomes in at-risk infants and facilitate the move towards precision medicine. Our objective is to apply DL to MRI acquired at term equivalent age for early prediction of neurodevelopment deficits (cognitive, language, and motor) at age 2 in VPI. Our group has identified three key components necessary for accurate prognostic models of later neurodevelopment. DL analysis of 1) anatomical features derived from structural MRI (sMRI) allowing detection of brain structural abnormalities and tissue pathologies; 2) brain connectivity features derived from resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion MRI (dMRI) giving insights into atypical brain connectivity patterns; and 3) integration of anatomical and connectivity features, thus enhancing abnormal neurodevelopment prediction. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts in accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1 and Aim 2, we will develop deepAna and deepConn models analyzing anatomical and connectivity features independently to predict adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes. By decoding each model, we will identify, validate and disseminate a series of the most discriminative anatomical and connectivity features to the research community. In Aim 3, we will develop an ensemble deepAnaConn model analyzing both anatomical and connectivity features, together with clinical risk factors, for early prediction of neurodevelopmental deficits. This model will help clinicians to predict later outcomes for those at-risk prematurely born infants before initial neonatal intensive care unit discharge. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data and will open the ‘black-box’ of DL to aid interpretation of imaging and clinical findings. The techniques we develop are expected to improve the modelling fidelity in medical diagnosis/ prognosis in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. The DL models we develop will not only benefit early detection of neurodevelopmental deficits in VPI, but also likely benefit individuals with other neurodevelopmental and neurological diseases. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow clinicians to target clinical and experimental intervention therapies to the most at-risk infants during periods of optimal neuroplasticity, and thus ultimately improve medical outcomes and patient well-being. Project Narrative Babies born at younger than 32 weeks’ gestation (~100,000 per year in the US) are at high risk for neurodevelopmental problems that can have a lifelong impact on quality of life. Early, targeted intervention while the brain is still malleable is the key, but accurately predicting which children will develop which problems, has not yet been successful. Herein, we propose to use artificial intelligence/deep learning, which works by feeding a computer program with existing imaging, clinical and outcome data, and then generating a template by which clinicians can compare new imaging and clinical data to accurately predict outcomes, thus allowing early, aggressive intervention where appropriate.",MRI and Deep Learning for Early Prediction of Neurodevelopmental Deficits in Very Preterm Infants,10028428,R01EB029944,"['5 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Anatomic Models', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Child', 'Child Welfare', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Distant', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Family', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Problem', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Infant', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Series', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'computer program', 'connectome', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'feeding', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neonate', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'repository', 'risk prediction model', 'social', 'success']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2020,297504,0.041986333032501176
"Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of this R01 project is to develop an automated assessment system that can capitalize on state of the art sensing technologies and machine learning algorithms to enable accurate and early detection of infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disabilities. In the USA, 1 in 10 infants are born at risk for these disabilities. For children with neurodevelopmental disabilities, early treatment in the first year of life improves long-term outcomes. However, we are currently held back by inadequacies of available clinical tests to measure and predict impairment. Existing tests are hard to administer, require specialized training, and have limited long- term predictive value. There is a critical need to develop an objective, accurate, easy-to-use tool for the early prediction of long-term physical disability. The field of pediatrics and infant development would greatly benefit from a quantitative score that would correlate with existing clinical measures used today to detect movement impairments in very young infants. To realize a new generation of tests that will be easy to administer, we will obtain large datasets of infants playing in an instrumented gym or simply being recorded while moving in a supine posture. Video and sensor data analyses will convert movement into feature vectors based on our knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach will use machine learning to relate these feature vectors to currently recommended clinical tests or other ground truth information. The power of this design is that algorithms can utilize many aspects of movement to produce the relevant scores. Our preliminary data allows us to lay the following aims: 1)Aim 1: To assess concurrent validity of a multimodal instrumented gym with existing clinical tools. Here, using 150 infants (75 with early brain injury and 75 controls), we will focus on converting data from an instrumented gym into estimates of the standard clinical tests; 2)Aim 2: To develop a computer vision-based algorithm to quantify infant motor performance from single camera video. Here using video data from 1200 infants (400 with early brain injury, 400 preterm without early brain injury, 400 controls), plus those gathered from Aim 1 and Aim 3, we will extract pose data from single-camera video recordings and convert these into kinematic features and relevant scores needed to classify infant movement; 3)Aim3: To discover the features related to long-term motor development. Here we will convert data collected longitudinally from 50 infants (25 with early brain injury and 25 controls) using both instrumented gym and video recordings into estimates standard clinical tests change over time and track features over developmental timescales. These three aims spearhead the use of real world behavior for movement scoring. Our aims will bring us closer to a universal non-invasive test for early detection of neurodevelopmental disabilities and lay the groundwork for long-term prediction of disability. But above all, it promises to scale to infants worldwide, producing an affordable tool to aid in infant health assessment. NARRATIVE Increased survival rates of medically fragile infants lead to an increased number of children with functional impairments later in life. Early detection of motor delays or impairments provides the opportunity for early treatment which improves health outcomes. This study will use state of the art sensors combined with machine learning approaches to develop objective, accurate, easy-to-use tools for the early scoring of deficits and lays the foundation for the early prediction of physical disability.",Automated Assessment of Neurodevelopment in Infants at Risk for Motor Disability,9993993,R01HD097686,"['Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Asphyxia', 'Back', 'Behavior', 'Birth History', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Consumption', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Early treatment', 'Educational Status', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hand Strength', 'Health', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Infant Health', 'Infection', 'Intervention', 'Intuition', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Limb structure', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Neurodevelopmental Disability', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Pediatrics', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Posture', 'Predictive Value', 'Premature Birth', 'Risk', 'School-Age Population', 'Seizures', 'Supination', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toy', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Video Recording', 'Work', 'base', 'critical period', 'design', 'disability', 'drug abuse in pregnancy', 'early screening', 'functional disability', 'functional outcomes', 'health assessment', 'improved', 'infant monitoring', 'instrument', 'kinematics', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'motor control', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neonatal stroke', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel strategies', 'physically handicapped', 'pressure', 'prognostic tool', 'recruit', 'screening', 'sensor', 'sensor technology', 'skeletal', 'tool', 'vector']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,670354,0.09098082860121624
"Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Abstract: The increasing availability of infant brain MR images, such as those that will be collected through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP, on which Dr. Shen is a Co-PI, focusing on data acquisition), affords unprecedented opportunities for precise charting of dynamic early brain developmental trajectories in understanding normative and aberrant growth. However, to fully benefit from these datasets, a major barrier that needs to be overcome is the critical lacking of computational tools for accurate processing and analysis of infant MRI data, which typically exhibit poor tissue contrast, large within tissue intensity variation, and regionally-heterogeneous and dynamic changes. To fill this critical gap, in 2012 we pioneered in creating an infant-centric MRI processing software package, called infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Tool (iBEAT), and a set of infant-specific atlases, called UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases, and further made them freely and publicly available via NITRC. Over the last 4 years, iBEAT and UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases have been downloaded 2900+ and 5600+ times, respectively, and contributed to 160+ independent research papers. As indicated by 30+ support letters, iBEAT is now driving the research for MRI studies of early brain development in many labs throughout the world. Results produced by iBEAT are also highlighted in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT, by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. To achieve this goal, we propose four aims. In Aim 1, we will create an innovative learning-based multi-source information integration framework for joint skull stripping and tissue segmentation for accurate structural measurements. Our method employs random forest to adaptively learn the optimal image appearance features from multimodality images and also informative context features from tissue probability maps. In Aim 2, we will construct longitudinal infant brain atlases at multiple time points (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age) for both T1-/T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR images. We propose a longitudinally-consistent sparse representation technique to construct representative atlases with significantly improved structural details by explicitly dealing with possible misalignments between images even after registration. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel learning-based approach for cortical topology correction and integrate it, along with our infant-centric analysis tools and atlases for cortical surfaces, into iBEAT for precise mapping of dynamic and complex cortical changes in infants. Unlike existing tools that perform poorly for infant brains, we will incorporate infant-dedicated tools for topology correction, surface reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and measurements. We will further integrate longitudinal infant cortical surface atlases equipped with parcellations based on growth trajectories. In Aim 4, we will significantly enhance iBEAT in terms of its software functionalities as well as user support via systematic outreach and training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC. Project Narrative This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. In particular, we propose four aims: 1) Learning-Based Brain Segmentation; 2) Infant Brain Atlases in the First Year of Life; 3) Cortical Surface-Based Analysis; and 4) Enhancing User Experience and Training.

"An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers Motor development plays a pivotal role in an infant’s overall development and has a cascading effect on social, cognitive, memory, and language ability. These functions can be compromised when motor development is disrupted; motor disruption is associated with generalized developmental delays. Early screening and identification of delays can allow early interventions with the goal of not just improving motor function but overall development in other domains. Experience with independent or motorized crawling is shown to improve spatial memory in infants. Active motor training, even as early as 3 months, is shown to achieve gains in object exploration and social engagement that persist long after the training sessions, indicating the benefits of early intervention. Children who get developmental screening are more likely to be identified with delays and receive early intervention services compared to those that only receive age-appropriate milestone checks as part of pediatric well-child visits. However, comprehensive motor screening, using standardized instruments, for developmental surveillance is labor intensive and requires specialized training in administration and evaluation. Shortage of resources to perform frequent, gold-standard, comprehensive motor assessments can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and contribute negatively to lifelong outcomes for infants at risk for behavioral and developmental disorders. In the US, 15-20% of children have a developmental or behavioral disability, but less than a third of them get diagnosed before entering school, preventing opportunities for early intervention during a critical period of brain development. In Phase I, we built a prototype Human Action Recognition Engine (HARE) to automate extraction of infant motor movement from video; then utilized this engine to demonstrate the feasibility of an automated developmental risk screener by leveraging recent advances in machine learning to achieve state of the art accuracies in assessment of infant motor development. In Phase II, we aim to build out the risk screener, SCOREIT, as a clinically deployable, cost-effective, developmental risk assessment tool to identify children who need further clinical follow-up. SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental screening by bringing the power of comprehensive motor screening, usually administered only to at-risk children utilizing specialized resources, to underserved and economically-fragile communities. Less than a third of US children receive developmental screening. SCOREIT can bring risk screenings to the over 70% of children that currently do not receive them, increasing opportunities for early intervention for behavioral and developmental disorders. Additionally, the HARE system’s ability to automatically extract and quantify motor movements from video can be an enabler for explorations of early markers for behavioral and developmental disorders, significantly easing manual video coding burdens and accelerating the pace of discoveries. This proposal introduces an automated, portable, low-cost developmental risk assessment tool, SCOREIT, that leverages advances in machine learning to extract motor movements from infant videos and generate a motor developmental score based on a standardized instrument (Alberta Infant Motor Scale; AIMS). SCOREIT has the potential to transform early developmental risk screening by bringing the power of standardized, comprehensive motor screening to underserved, economically-fragile communities, and increase opportunities for early intervention of developmental disorders.",An Automated Early Motor Development Risk Screener from Observational Video Recordings of Infants and Toddlers,9785611,R44HD095783,"['Address', 'Age', 'Alberta province', 'American', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Catalogs', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Coordination Disorders', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Infant', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Parents', 'Pediatrics', 'Phase', 'Physical therapy', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Questionnaires', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Screening procedure', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Supination', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Video Recording', 'Visit', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cognitive performance', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'early screening', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infant outcome', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'learning network', 'motor function improvement', 'portability', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'relating to nervous system', 'screening', 'service intervention', 'social', 'social engagement', 'spatial memory', 'tool']",NICHD,"BSOLUTIONS, INC.",R44,2020,601447,0.06035992816063652
"Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention Given the difficulty of reversing obesity once present, there has been increasing focus on the primary prevention of obesity early in the lifecourse. Few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. This proposal summarizes a 5-year program of mentored professional development tied to a multi-method research project intended to improve the identification and potential treatment of infants and toddlers with high risk for obesity. My long-term goal is to prevent obesity by identifying infants at greatest risk and providing for them an effective, family-centered intervention that targets modifiable, life course factors. My central hypothesis, based on my prior research, is that identifying infants at risk for obesity prior to the onset of unhealthy weight gain will enable early intervention. My research plan aims to: (1) create risk prediction models for obesity at age 24 months by linking three existing data systems that combine birth certificate, contextual- level, and health outcome data; (2) test the feasibility of linking these data prospectively to validate the Aim 1 obesity risk prediction models over a 24-month period within a contemporary, clinical cohort; and (3) identify best approaches for family-focused risk communication regarding the prevention of excessive weight gain and obesity in infants and toddlers using a human-centered design approach. Through my career development plan and guidance from my mentors, I will expand upon a foundation in epidemiology and pediatric health services research to develop expertise in machine learning, health informatics, data integration, qualitative methods, human-centered design, and behavior change. Together, the research and educational aims of this proposal will provide me with the necessary groundwork to compete for additional funding as an independent investigator. Specifically, I will seek R03-level grant funding from the NIDDK in year 4 of my K01 award to test the communication strategy developed in Aim 3 and to partner with families to modify an existing behavioral change intervention for use in infancy. By the end of this award, I will be well positioned to apply for funding from the NIDDK to conduct a robust R01-level study that combines the validated prediction models, family- focused communication strategy, and modified intervention to determine whether we can effectively prevent obesity in those infants and toddlers identified as being at the highest risk. This line of research will help ensure that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them. I will accomplish this work under the mentorship of Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, a child health services researcher, and a multidisciplinary team of faculty with expertise machine learning, health informatics, data integration and surveillance, qualitative research, human-centered design approaches, behavior change, and childhood obesity. I am ideally suited to complete this research due to my past research productivity, current mentorship team, open access to health care data, and the established clinical decision support infrastructure at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Project Narrative Increasing evidence suggests that the infancy and toddler periods represent the best opportunity for obesity prevention, but few attempts have been made to prevent obesity during the first years of life. The current proposal seeks to develop practical methods to assess the risk of future obesity in infants and toddlers in the clinical setting, and to partner with families to explore new ways to communicate early life obesity risk in ways that account for their perceptions, concerns and beliefs. This proposal has the promise to lead to targeted, tailored interventions for infants most at-risk for obesity, ensuring that prevention efforts are deployed in an efficient, cost-effective manner and accepted by those who need them.",Obesity Prevention in Early Life (OPEL): Risk Screening and Targeted Intervention,9912764,K01DK114383,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Belief', 'Birth Certificates', 'Child', 'Child Health Services', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Indiana', 'Infant', 'Information Systems', 'Infrastructure', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Epidemic', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Perception', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy Histories', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Prevention', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Publishing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Toddler', 'Universities', 'Weight', 'Weight Gain', 'Work', 'approach behavior', 'base', 'behavior change', 'career development', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'data integration', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'health care availability', 'health data', 'healthy weight', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'obesity in children', 'obesity prevention', 'obesity risk', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'sociodemographics', 'tool']",NIDDK,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,K01,2020,139614,0.051026716985792545
"Maternal Antecedents and Electronic Fetal Monitoring in Term Asphyxia (MAESTRA) Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a neurologic syndrome that results from reduced flow of oxygenated blood to the fetal or newborn brain. HIE occurs in 1-3 per 1,000 term births and may cause death or neurologic disabilities such as cerebral palsy. Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) was developed in the 1970's to assess the adequacy of fetal oxygenation as a strategy to prevent HIE, and is now standard of care. Yet clinical trials report that EFM usage has not reduced the rate of CP, perinatal death or HIE, but is associated with a dramatic increase in cesarean deliveries. The currently used 3 Category fetal heart rate (FHR) classification system, based on simple rules designed to be easy to apply at the bedside, has some utility in predicting HIE. However, Category II FHR patterns that make up the vast majority of tracings are poorly predictive of HIE and confer “indeterminate” risk. Category III patterns are also of limited use in predicting HIE due to low sensitivity. There is an urgent need to develop better objective methods to assess EFM that would identify more fetuses at risk of HIE in time for corrective actions. Uterine tachysystole, or excessive frequency of uterine contractions, has been implicated as a preventable cause of HIE; yet studies report conflicting results. EFM research has been limited by an inability to access and manually analyze the large datasets needed to study HIE. We now have the ability to analyze digital EFM signals using automated methods to measure standard FHR patterns as well as to discover novel aspects of the tracing that may not be readily detectable by a clinician at the bedside. We hypothesize that modern signal processing and machine learning techniques can create highly predictive models of HIE by analyzing established and novel features of EFM tracings, in combination with demographic and pertinent clinical information from the mother and fetus. We propose a population-based retrospective cohort study of 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2010-19. Our specific aims are: 1) To create the MAESTRA Cohort dataset that links EFM recordings to HIE and neonatal acidosis among 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation in 2010-19 at Kaiser Permanente Northern CA; 2) Using modern signal processing and machine learning techniques, to extract established and novel FHR and uterine contractility features from the EFM recordings, and to determine which of these features are most predictive of HIE and acidosis when combined with maternal and fetal clinical data; and 3) To perform external validation by applying the final predictive models to a historical dataset. We anticipate that machine learning techniques incorporating novel FHR and uterine contractility patterns over time, as well as pre- and perinatal clinical characteristics, will improve the predictive value of the EFM data that are already being collected as part of routine care. Our results will inform future clinical trials. Such an unprecedented large-scale multidisciplinary study will lead to improvements in our ability to use EFM data to prevent neonatal brain injury while minimizing unnecessary cesarean sections. MAESTRA Project Narrative Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs when a baby gets reduced oxygen and blood flow to the brain, and can lead to death or long-term disabilities such as cerebral palsy. During labor and delivery, doctors are able to continuously record the heart rate of the fetus. This study will determine how best to use the heart rate information so that we can reduce the number of infants who develop this severe brain condition.",Maternal Antecedents and Electronic Fetal Monitoring in Term Asphyxia (MAESTRA),9972526,R01HD099216,"['Acidosis', 'Address', 'Apgar Score', 'Asphyxia', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'California', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cesarean section', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Educational workshop', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Heart Rate', 'Infant', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metabolic Brain Diseases', 'Metabolic acidosis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Brain Injury', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal anoxic ischemic brain injury', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'falls', 'fetal', 'fetus at risk', 'high risk', 'hypoxia neonatorum', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'routine care', 'signal processing', 'standard measure', 'standard of care', 'uterine contractility']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,667049,0.010957678983336099
"A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome Longitudinal MRI Characterization of Very Early Brain Development  in Infants with Down Syndrome Project Summary/Abstract Down syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with varying degrees of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Pharmacologic therapies and genetic modulators are emerging which, if administered early in conjunction with traditional therapies, show promise for improving developmental outcomes in children with DS. However, the stark absence of early neurodevelopment knowledge in DS hampers these efforts. The main goal of this proposal is to develop biomarkers as future targets for specific therapies based on careful characterization of early aberrant neurodevelopmental patterns. This study will be a combined effort with WU as the coordinating center and six other research groups: UNC, UW, CHOP, MNI, NYU, and University of Minnesota. These groups comprise the ACE-IBIS (Autism Center of Excellence Infant Brain Imaging Study) network, a well-established and experienced group that has been productively collaborating for 8 years on MRI imaging and behavioral characterization of infants at high risk for autism, healthy typical infants (TYP), and infants with Fragile X. The aims of this proposal are: 1) Define the longitudinal characteristics of early brain development in infants (3 to 24 months) with DS in comparison to TYP infants and infants with other developmental disabilities (ASD and Fragile X) using three different types of neuroimaging (MRI, DTI, rsfMRI); 2) Develop predictive models for developmental outcomes in infants with DS based on longitudinal structural or functional MRI characteristics; and 3) Characterize brain-behavior correlates with coordinated multimodal imaging in infancy characterizing the interrelationship between longitudinal network imaging parameters and cognitive, behavioral and neurodevelopmental outcomes using sophisticated multivariate support vector machine (SVM) analytic strategies. 120 infants with DS and 40 TYP control infants will be followed longitudinally from 3 to 24 months. MRI scans will be obtained during natural sleep and a series of well-validated developmental and behavioral assessments will be completed at each visit. This project will be the first to define the nature and timing of alterations in brain development in infants with DS. The proposed project addresses several key research recommendations from the “NICHD 2014-The NIH Research Plan on Down Syndrome.” The study aims match the recommendation for the quantitative characterization based on imaging of early brain development and the relationship of cognitive, behavioral and social development to early aberrant neurodevelopment in DS. This project will also address recommendations for investigation of comorbid ASD in DS, which could be as high as 5-10%. The IBIS network is uniquely qualified to examine early neurodevelopmental patterns, utilizing the ASD, TYP and FraX infant data sets to better characterize and examine specificity of DS early developmental patterns including ASD qualities and impairments in social development. It is clear that quantification of neurodevelopmental trajectories in infants with DS will be critical to identification of personalized intervention strategies and to assess the efficacy of early life, targeted, highly novel and mechanistically specific DS interventions. Project Narrative Down's syndrome (DS), the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability, is associated with a wide range of cognitive and behavioral impairments. Through the use of cutting edge MRI technology that allows us to look at the shape, function, and connections within the brain, we will be able to study and better understand early brain development in infants with DS. Working toward the goal to be able to assess the impact of specific early intervention therapies that are most helpful in improving the developmental outcomes of children with DS. This study mirrors and expands on the study designs and techniques that were developed to study infants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Fragile X, and typically developing infants, and will allow us to further our understanding of maturation patterns of infant brains that we can apply to DS, ASD, Fragile X, and other disabilities.",A Longitudinal MRI Study Characterizing Very Early Brain Development in Infants with Down Syndrome,9998993,R01HD088125,"['Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Attention', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Disabilities', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Down Syndrome', 'Early Intervention', 'Evaluation', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Life', 'Life Expectancy', 'Live Birth', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Minnesota', 'Motor', 'Motor Skills', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rest', 'Sedation procedure', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Social Development', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thick', 'Time', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive development', 'comorbidity', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data acquisition', 'developmental disease', 'disability', 'experience', 'functional disability', 'gastrointestinal', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'malformation', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'personalized intervention', 'predictive modeling', 'preservation', 'recruit', 'skills', 'support vector machine', 'targeted treatment', 'traditional therapy', 'visual tracking', 'white matter']",NICHD,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,2368051,0.016709370022254217
"Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders Project Summary/Abstract In this K23 career development award, Dr. Rujuta Wilson will develop training in quantitative analysis of motor development to aid in early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Dr. Wilson’s longer-term goal is to be a leading clinician-scientist in motor development, utilizing novel quantitative methods and analyses to identify mechanisms, biomarkers, and treatments of motor impairments across diverse developmental populations affected by these impairments. Through the support of this K23 and the enriched transdisciplinary training environment and resources at UCLA, Dr. Wilson aims to accomplish the following training goals: (1) develop expertise in theoretical models and assessment of infant motor and developmental trajectories, (2) acquire knowledge of optimal statistical methods and skills in longitudinal modeling, signal processing, and machine learning techniques to analyze complex quantitative motor data and develop prediction models, (3) develop proficiency in advanced methods of clinical research design and implementation, and (4) translate the K23 training and findings into an R01 utilizing motor risk markers to aid in clinical stratification and monitor developmental outcomes of a targeted motor intervention. To achieve these goals, Dr. Wilson has assembled an exemplary mentorship team, including her primary mentor, Dr. James McCracken, a child psychiatrist with decades of research dedicated to studying development in children and in design and conduct of clinical trials in NDDs; co-mentor, Dr. Grace Baranek, a leader in the study of sensory- motor and behavioral risk markers of NDDs in the first year of life; co-mentor, Dr. David Elashoff, a leader of biostatistics with extensive knowledge of high dimensional data sets and sensor monitoring data; collaborators and contributors, Drs. William Kaiser, Beth Smith, Shafali Jeste, and Susan Bookheimer, experts in advanced analytic techniques of signal processing and machine learning, wearable sensors, high risk infant studies, and neuroimaging methods in high risk infants, respectively. Motor impairments occur across an array of NDDs and emerge early in disease course, but early identification remains an ongoing challenge due to lack of quantitative measures that can objectively identify these early motor impairments. The overarching goal of the proposed longitudinal study is to (1) utilize a validated wearable sensor to derive quantitative measurements of motor function and identify motor impairments in infants at high risk for NDDs (e.g., infants with an older sibling with Autism Spectrum Disorder [ASD]) as early as 3 months of age, and (2) examine the relationship of these motor impairments to symptoms of ASD and to delays in social communication, language, and cognition. This proposal will facilitate the development of novel transdiagnostic motor phenotyping tools that can be utilized to inform clinical screening, clinical risk stratification, and intervention studies across a range of neurologic disorders. These aims directly address NICHD research priorities; in particular, “research establishing the validity of biomarkers and outcome measures for intellectual and developmental disability symptoms.” Project Narrative Motor development plays a crucial role in the acquisition of social communication skills, cognition, and language, and motor impairments detrimentally affect downstream development. Many neurodevelopmental disorders describe motor impairments as an early comorbid symptom; however, current standardized assessments of motor function fail to clearly characteize these early motor impairments. This longitudinal study will utilize quantitative measures to objectively characterize the earliest manifestation of motor impairments in infants at high risk for autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders and elucidate the mechanistic relationship of these impairments to symptoms of autism and other adverse developmental outcomes with the goal to improve early identification and inform targeted interventions.",Quantification of Infant Motor Development to Predict Risk for Neurodevelopmental Disorders,9977506,K23HD099275,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age-Months', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Intellectual functioning disability', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Leg', 'Life', 'Life Experience', 'Locomotion', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Motor Manifestations', 'Motor Skills', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurologist', 'Neurology', 'Normal Range', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal Brain Injury', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Siblings', 'Space Perception', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Theoretical model', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Visual Motor Coordinations', 'advanced analytics', 'associated symptom', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical risk', 'cognitive process', 'design', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'improved', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'language impairment', 'motor impairment', 'multidimensional data', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'screening', 'sensor', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'social communication', 'social engagement', 'standardize measure', 'statistics', 'study population', 'tool', 'wearable sensor technology']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2020,177444,0.035117566951743104
"Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity This proposal describes a rigorous and comprehensive plan designed to obtain expert training in advanced MRI acquisition and analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and fetal programming of health and disease risk. The proposed research relates to the public health problem of childhood obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. Obesity is a multi-factorial phenotype. Among these factors, the critical importance of energy homeostasis (balance), and the hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates it, is well established. However, it is unclear whether the observed difference in this brain circuitry between obese and normal-weight individuals is a cause or consequence of the obese state. Also, relatively little is known about the developmental origin (fetal and early postnatal) of variation in this brain circuitry and its prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. My proposal addresses this fundamental knowledge gap. I advance the overarching hypothesis that energy homeostasis brain circuitry a) already is established by the time of birth; b) exhibits developmental plasticity (fetal programming); and c) is functionally relevant (predicts postnatal adipose tissue accrual). The K99 mentored phase will be conducted under the mentorship of leading experts in fetal programming of health and disease (P. Wadhwa), brain imaging (P. Thompson), and developmental systems neuroscience (D. Fair). I will first develop novel MRI-based measures of the newborn brain circuitry underlying energy homeostasis, and then identify the prenatal determinants of variation in this circuitry. The importance of focusing efforts on the newborn brain derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time is not yet influenced by postnatal factors. In the R00 phase, I will recruit a new cohort and use a repeated measures design to address the functional relevance of the initial (newborn) setting of this brain circuitry in the context of adipose tissue accrual over infancy (a key indicator of childhood obesity risk). K99/Aim 1. Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry, this aim will fulfill an important and as yet unmet need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also technical capability. K99/Aim 2. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology) determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are associated with infant adiposity. R00/Aim 3. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity risk. R00/Aim 4. Consider the complimentary hypothesis that infant adiposity at birth is prospectively associated with changes in newborn energy homeostasis brain circuitry. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan for the applicant, Dr. Jerod Rasmussen, to obtain expert training and conduct research that aims to identify novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, identify their gestational biology determinants, and determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood obesity. The identification of brain-related biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity,10022151,K99HD100593,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemical Shift Imaging', 'Cholesterol', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'data reduction', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'energy balance', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'metabolic rate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'obstetrical complication', 'population based', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'sex', 'skills', 'vector', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K99,2020,108600,0.05179206671916053
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9980863,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,682143,0.013344333052874574
"Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders Project Summary: Early life psychosocial adversity and stress are well-established as the most powerful environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children. Impairments in developing emotion regulation and cognitive control and associated alterations in brain development have been shown to mediate the effects of adversity on risk for the development of psychopathology. Early psychosocial adversity impacts the epigenetic and inflammation-mediated processes that contribute to these negative outcomes, a process known as “biological embedding of stress.” While this risk trajectory has been clearly linked to increased rates of psychopathology, the mechanisms of this process, its targetable mediators and how early in development they operate are yet to be determined. Here we focus on the effects of early life adversity on brain, emotion regulation and cognitive control outcomes relevant to risk for mental disorders, beginning antenatally and extending to age 3. We will examine the role of pre- and postnatal adversity/stress, the maternal and child perinatal gut microbiome and early caregiver support on these key neurodevelopmental outcomes utilizing state-of-the-art neuroimaging. Our unifying hypothesis is that these factors modulate systemic inflammatory responses, induce neuronal effects through this and other processes that adversely impact brain development in limbic and cortical regions, and mediate the effects of early adversity on child emotion regulation, cognitive control and mental health outcomes. These factors will be studied in a unique, prospectively ascertained cohort of 370 mothers and their offspring at high psychosocial risk being recruited as part of an already funded March of Dimes project at Washington University. The cohort will include both term- and prematurely-born infants and toddlers given the increased risk of psychosocial adversity and aberrant gut microbiome in preterm children. The offspring will be intensively prospectively studied from the 1st trimester to age 3, providing a unique dataset in which to examine the interrelationships among pre- and postnatal adversity, biomarkers of inflammation, the gut microbiome and developmental and mental health outcomes. The perinatal and early childhood periods are critical times to study these exposures as adverse neurodevelopment associated with adversity begins in utero through fetal programming. Likewise, the perinatal period is a critical developmental window for microbial influences, when gut microbial colonization has its most enduring effects. The proposed study merges established research groups in these areas in a center with advanced infant and childhood neuroimaging and extensive microbiome expertise, and offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand the mechanisms of the biological embedding of adversity on brain, cognitive and emotional trajectories in a high-risk cohort. We will also apply innovative computational methods, using Deep Learning, to extend understanding of these data. Findings will provide critical and novel insights to inform early preventive interventions relevant to emotional, cognitive and mental health outcomes for children at greatest risk. Project Narrative This study will investigate the mechanisms by which psychosocial adversity experienced in utero and early in life impact the child’s brain, cognitive and emotional development, testing the hypothesis that stress and adversity during pregnancy adversely affect early brain development through inflammatory mechanisms. Another important focus of this project is to examine how the maternal perinatal microbiome and infant’s gut microbiome during early childhood impact brain development, either through the infant’s inflammatory response or other effects. A third focus is to explore the effects of caregiver support on this risk trajectory, testing the idea that high caregiver support reduces the negative influences of early adversity, altered immune biomarkers and disruptions in the gut microbiome.","Early Life Adversity, Biological Embedding, and Risk for Developmental Precursors of Mental Disorders",9929031,R01MH113883,"['3 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caregiver support', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cognitive', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Funding', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Immunologic Markers', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Informal Social Control', 'Instruction', 'Life', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mothers', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Poverty', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Trimesters', 'Pregnant Women', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specimen', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Trauma', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'antenatal', 'base', 'cervicovaginal', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'deep learning', 'early childhood', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'fetal programming', 'gray matter', 'gut colonization', 'gut microbiome', 'high risk', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'infant gut microbiome', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'maternal microbiome', 'microbial', 'microbial colonization', 'microbiome', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'perinatal period', 'postnatal', 'premature', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'white matter']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,2343175,0.019525471320597156
"Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity This revised application, submitted in response to NIH PA-18-741 “Secondary Analyses in Obesity,  Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,” relates to the public health problem of childhood  obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, determinants and role of energy balance  homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. The proposal describes a comprehensive  plan designed to advance neonatal MRI analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and  fetal programming of health and disease risk. The critical importance of the  hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates energy homeostasis is well  established, and MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuits have been  associated with obesity outcomes. However, it is unclear whether the observed differences in these  brain regions and circuitry in obese relative to normal-weight individuals are a cause,  consequence, or both, of the obese state. Moreover, relatively little is known about the  developmental ontogeny of these brain regions and circuitry, particularly during the fetal period,  and their prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. This project addresses  this fundamental knowledge gap. We will develop novel measures and conduct analyses using newborn  brain imaging and other data elements from 4 inter-linked NIH-funded projects on prenatal stress  and fetal programming of brain development and infant body composition (R01 HD-060628; R01  MH-091351; R01 HD-065825; UG3 OD-023349). The importance of selecting the newborn brain as the  starting time point derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time could not yet have  been influenced by postnatal factors such as diet/feeding, thereby enabling the study to  disentangle the temporality of effects. In a recent position paper on the pathogenesis of obesity,  the U.S. Endocrine Society emphasized the need to conceptualize obesity as a disorder of the  energy homeostasis system and elucidate its underlying mechanisms and developmental influences.  Towards this objective, and using a population of ~100 mother-infant dyads followed from early  gestation through birth till 5 yrs age, we will integrate research aims that leverage the resources  of these projects to advance our understanding of the origins of childhood obesity. Aim 1.  Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional  MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry,  this aim will fulfill an important need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also  technical capability. Aim 2. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these  novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human  newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity  and subsequent childhood obesity risk. Aim 3. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology)  determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are  associated with infant adiposity. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of  energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately  provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of  childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan to conduct research that aims to identify  novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn,  determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood  obesity, and identify their gestational biology determinants. The identification of brain-related  biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment  will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early  identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity,9959421,R21DK118578,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Body Composition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Endocrine', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'clinically significant', 'connectome', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'energy balance', 'feeding', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'follow-up', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'inter-individual variation', 'interest', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'obstetrical complication', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'vector', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R21,2020,158513,0.052888996667567065
"Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress PROJECT SUMMARY Childhood traumatic stress (CTS), resulting from experiences such as abuse and neglect, is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences effecting overall health across the lifespan. Growing evidence shows that the negative effects of CTS are not limited to a single individual and may be transmitted across generations, increasing the risk for behavioral and psychiatric disorders in the offspring. Psychological stress during pregnancy is associated with heightened stress responses, emotional dysregulation, and behavioral problems in infancy and early childhood potentially making it a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of trauma. The majority of studies examining maternal psychological stress (MPS) during pregnancy consider the magnitude of stress as the `risk factor' for alterations in offspring development; however, psychological stress, particularly during the prenatal period, is dynamic and variable. Infant neurodevelopment occurs sequentially and is sensitive to environmental influences, meaning that the effect of any insult is likely as much about the timing, as it is the magnitude. As a result, it remains unclear which aspects of stress most strongly impact offspring development – is it simply the magnitude as previously suggested, or does the trajectory matter as well? Understanding the variability of prenatal factors and their influence on infant neurobiological and psychosocial development is critical to targeting preventive interventions. The goal of this proposal is to explore maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress. The overall hypothesis is that a history of maternal CTS will increase the amplitude and velocity of MPS trajectories compared to a low-risk group, will predict increased offspring limbic system connectivity and negative affect expression, and that an intervention to reduce MPS in a high-risk sample will alter the observed trajectories. These hypotheses will be tested using a novel methodology that characterizes the longitudinal heterogeneity of psychological symptom data to create MPS trajectories. These trajectories will be used to explore the role of timing and rate of change of MPS on offspring neurobiological and affective development and, further, to test whether these trajectories mediate the effects of CTS on infant development. The specific aims of this proposal are: (1) To characterize the longitudinal heterogeneity of MPS in a sample of women with and without a history of CTS; (2) To examine the effects of heterogeneous longitudinal trajectories in MPS on offspring limbic system and negative affect development in mothers with and without childhood trauma; and (3) (Exploratory) To determine whether an intervention designed to reduce MPS will alter MPS trajectories in a high-risk sample. This study aims to elucidate the importance of trajectories of MPS for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS. Achieving these goals will provide insight into the best timing for targeted screening and interventions to alter MPS during pregnancy for women with a history of CTS and, thereby, reduce the risk of offspring psychiatric disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood traumatic stress is a pervasive public health problem with devastating and lasting consequences for psychological well-being, such as increased stress reactivity and increased risk for perinatal psychopathology. The proposed research will integrate tools from developmental neuroscience, clinical science, and computer science to: (1) examine the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a potential mediator of childhood traumatic stress on infant brain and negative affect development; and (2) evaluate whether an intervention designed to reduce maternal psychological stress will alter the longitudinal heterogeneity of maternal prenatal stress. By identifying the importance of trajectories of maternal psychological stress during pregnancy for offspring brain and affective development, and as a mechanism for intergenerational transmission of CTS, this work stands to improve the targeting and timing of prenatal interventions for women with a history of childhood traumatic stress.",Maternal psychological stress during pregnancy as a key mechanism for the intergenerational transmission of childhood traumatic stress,9999677,F30MH118762,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Anxiety', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Brain', 'Child Traumatic Stress', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Limbic System', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mothers', 'Neonatal', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Problem behavior', 'Psychological Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychosocial Stress', 'Public Health', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Stress', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Trauma', 'Well in self', 'Woman', 'Work', 'abuse neglect', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'early childhood', 'emotion dysregulation', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infancy', 'insight', 'intergenerational', 'maternal risk', 'maternal stress', 'mindfulness based cognitive therapy', 'negative affect', 'neurodevelopment', 'novel', 'offspring', 'pediatric trauma', 'prenatal', 'prenatal intervention', 'prenatal stress', 'psychological symptom', 'psychosocial development', 'random forest', 'rate of change', 'response', 'screening', 'stress reactivity', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,0.02141375294992516
"Place-level discrimination and birth outcomes Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability.  In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination  partially contributes to this disparity. Most of research on discrimination and birth outcomes  relies on self-reported experiences of discrimination, and there have been few studies examining  discrimination at the U.S. national level. Social contexts in which greater hostility towards  minorities is manifested may cause psychological stress and increase risk of adverse birth  outcomes. The scientific objective of this research plan is to develop a new county-level indicator  of discriminatory attitudes from social media data as well as make use hate crimes data and  measures of explicit and implicit racial bias to provide a detailed and nuanced investigation of  the impact of discrimination on birth outcomes and racial/ethnic disparities in birth outcomes.  Another strength of this research plan is the longitudinal study design with multiple years of data  for both measures of discrimination and birth outcomes, which allows us to control for temporal  trends and stable characteristics of the counties. Furthermore, the influence of discrimination on  birth outcomes may begin prior to pregnancy. There is increasing recognition of maternal health  prior to conception influencing fetal development and birth outcomes. The project will empirically  evaluate whether place-level discrimination is associated with biomarkers of chronic stress among  young women of child-bearing age. This research plan is complemented by a training plan that builds  on the applicant’s background in epidemiology and biostatistics and includes new training in: 1)  developing expertise in Big Data, 2) measurement of discrimination, and 3) stress physiology and  birth outcomes. The combined research and training plan will prepare the applicant for a successful  independent research career evaluating how discrimination impact minority health and health  disparities. Preterm and low birth weight are the leading causes of infant mortality and childhood disability.  In the U.S. racial disparities in birth outcomes persist, and there is evidence that discrimination  partially contributes to this disparity.

"A Novel Informatics System for Craniosynostosis Surgery Project Summary CranioSynOstosis (CSO) is the premature fusion of one or more of cranial sutures that connect individual skull bones for kids. The estimated prevalence of CSO is one in 2500 live births and even higher. Our ultimate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS). CSO is an extremely serious birth defect that involves the premature fusion, of one or more sutures on a baby's skull. CSO, in terms of the fused suture, could be classified mainly into several types of synostosis, such as sagittal, coronal, metopic, and lambdoid. Infants with CSO may have problems with brain and skull growth, resulting in cognitive impairment. This defect may not only ruin the infant's life, but also deeply affect the infant's family. SAS, recognized as a safe, effective, and less invasive treatment method, introduced to treat the CSO. This treatment uses the force of a spring to reshape the skull in a slower manner that harnesses the growth of the skull to assist with shape change. Patient-specific spring selection is the principal barrier to the advancement of SAS for CSO because few surgeons have the experience to select personalized springs for each patient. The selection of the spring force is a crucial step in this surgical treatment, and it is dependent on the experience of the surgeon. Important factors essential in the selection of the spring force include the ages, bone thickness and the subtypes of CSO. One example is that sagittal CSO with an elongated occiput needs a stronger posterior spring, while one with no predominant characteristics typically needs a mid-range anterior and posterior spring. The current problem is that we do not have a complete objective way of classification of CSO and sagittal CSO and estimation of the spring force for the individual. Our hypothesis is that CSO and sagittal CSO can be accurately classified based on the features from sutures and head shape, and behaviors of calvarial bone tissue following virtual optimal spring force can be accurately simulated by integrating a finite element method (FEM) with statistical learning model. To test our hypothesis, we are proposing the following Specific Aim: (1) To define the eSuture Informatic system and build the database, with CT and DTI data; (2) To develop tools for image processing, segmentation, registration, quantification of sutures, and automatically categorize each patient to one catalogue of the CSO types or sagittal CSO subtype; (3) To model and estimate the optimal spring force for SAS; and (4) To validate and evaluate the eSuture system. Our system will produce a paradigm shift in CSO diagnosis and treatment. Narrative Our immediate goal is to develop an open-source imaging-informatics-platform, eSuture, for clinicians to objectively classify the craniosynostosis (CSO) using computed tomography (CT) data, and accurately estimate patient-specific spring force for spring-assisted surgery (SAS).

"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Identification of Early Metabolomic and Immune Endotypes of Allergy and Asthma: An Integrated Multiomics Approach PROJECT SUMMARY Metabolic dysregulation due to in utero and early-life environmental exposures has lasting consequences on the developing immune system and lung and that these changes underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze. However, significant gaps remain in understanding the dysregulated metabolic-immune pathways and mechanisms involved in early childhood atopy and wheeze. Our preliminary study of the infant untargeted metabolome demonstrated that dysregulation in the unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) and lipid mediator's pathway are associated with number of wheeze episodes in a dose-response manner, which suggests the involvement of endogenous antioxidant and lipid mediator pathways. In another preliminary study of the infant immunome, we demonstrated that two distinct infant immune response profiles to acute respiratory infection, with an immune response pattern characterized by increased Type-2 and Type-17 and decreased non-interferon Type- 1 immune responses to with increased risk of recurrent wheeze. While these single omics studies can identify dysregulated metabolites and immune-responses in wheeze phenotypes, they alone fail to capture the full spectrum of underlying pathobiology. The integration of omics data has advanced the understanding of other chronic disease pathogenesis, as it is likely to do for childhood atopy and wheeze. Therefore, we hypothesize that the integration of early-life metabolome (including lipidome) and immunome can elucidate molecular pathways relevant to atopy and wheeze development. To test this hypothesis, the candidate will capitalize on existing carefully phenotyped population-based birth cohort of healthy infants (INSPIRE) and a replication cohort from the NIH ECHO initiative (ECHO-CREW asthma consortium) and accomplish the following specific aims: 1) To investigate whether increased unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) levels reduce early life atopy and wheeze incidence by enhancing the bioavailability of pro-resolving lipid mediators and antioxidants and decreasing pro-inflammatory lipid mediators, 2) To discover novel immunome profiles and network modules that characterize atopy and wheeze phenotypes, and 3) To uncover novel metabolic-immune molecular pathways associated with the development of atopy and wheeze phenotypes by integrating metabolome and immunome data. Successful completion of these aims will: (1) provide novel insights into the role of the early- life metabolome and immunome in the pathogenesis of atopy and wheeze and (2) identify targets for disease prevention. The proposal builds on the candidate's previous work, expertise, and interest in systems approaches to understand disease development. The goal of this career development proposal is for the candidate to emerge as an independent investigator in the field of asthma and allergy with unique knowledge and application of systems approaches to understand disease mechanisms. The candidate is in an outstanding academic environment, has a well thought out training and research plan, which will propel him into an independent expert in the field of immuno-metabolism of atopy and asthma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Early life metabolic dysregulation has lasting consequences on the developing infant immune system and lung, and these changes likely underlie the pathobiology of childhood atopy and wheeze (an early manifestation of allergy and asthma). Knowledge gaps remain in understanding the pathobiological mechanisms of atopy and wheeze phenotypes, which the proposed study aims to address by computationally integrating metabolome and immune response data to identify molecular pathways relevant to the pathobiology of atopic and wheeze phenotypes. Biomarker and pathway identification will aid in identifying targets for primary prevention of allergy and asthma syndromes in the pediatric population, which is of high public health priority.",Identification of Early Metabolomic and Immune Endotypes of Allergy and Asthma: An Integrated Multiomics Approach,10038057,K01HL149989,"['Acute respiratory infection', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Antioxidants', 'Arachidonic Acids', 'Asthma', 'Bilirubin', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early identification', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Fatty Acids', 'Feces', 'Goals', 'Heme', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Lung', 'Lung Inflammation', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Molecular', 'Nose', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Primary Prevention', 'Property', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Supervision', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Wheezing', 'Work', 'airway inflammation', 'atopy', 'career development', 'cohort', 'disorder prevention', 'early childhood', 'experience', 'in utero', 'infancy', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning network', 'lipid mediator', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'molecular subtypes', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'oxidation', 'population based', 'public health priorities', 'response', 'statistics', 'two-dimensional', 'unsupervised learning']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K01,2020,161835,0.007046173943938401
"Peripheral Immune Development in Premature Infants with  and without NEC Title: Peripheral Immune Development in Premature Infants with and without NEC Abstract: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating complication of prematurity that frequently results in death (20- 50%) or severe systemic complications. Although NEC is a multifactorial disease, its precise etiology continues to be poorly understood. As such, there are still no effective prevention methods or treatments available. Given increased intestinal and systemic inflammation seen in NEC, it is likely that the dysregulation of the immune system contributes to its pathogenesis. In order to better understand NEC pathogenesis, it is essential to have a solid understanding of normal immune development that occurs over the first two months of age in premature infants. Our preliminary data obtained from fetuses, patients with NEC and control subjects, show that there is a drastic reduction of total and tissue resident memory T cells in the intestinal tissue and an increase in T cells in the periphery. Moreover, NEC is associated with a significant increase in pro-inflammatory macrophages in intestinal tissue, and a concomitant decrease in circulating monocytes. Recent work has begun to address how neonatal peripheral immunity develops. However, data on the peripheral immune development in premature infants over the first two months of life is sparse. Therefore, the goal of this exploratory proposal is to define normal immune development of premature infants over the first two months of life and characterize its dysregulation in patients with NEC. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that development of the peripheral immune system in preterm infants is different in the innate and adaptive immune compartments from that of term infants, and it is this difference that makes them susceptible to NEC. As the blood volume in premature infants is limited, we have developed a methodology to perform deep immunophenotyping on as little as 100 µliters of blood using mass cytometry time of flight (CyTOF). This unique methodology will allow us to address the hypothesis, with the following aims: 1) Define the peripheral immune development of premature infants (<32 weeks) over the first two months of life. We will perform CyTOF on peripheral blood from 50 premature infants, with samples collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Deep characterization of the immune cell landscape and maps of the developmental trajectories of the major cell lineages in premature infants will be generated. 2) Identify peripheral immune cell abnormalities associated with the development of NEC. We will identify dysregulation of immune population trajectories specific to premature infants who develop NEC. This information will provide us with a model for the immune cell mechanism underlying susceptibility to NEC. This project would represent the first detailed deep examination of the development of the immune system in premature infants with and without NEC over the first two months, and will provide sufficient data for the development of a large-scale, in-depth study of the mechanism underlying the development of NEC. Project Narrative: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating complication of premature birth that frequently results in significant mortality and morbidity the pathophysiology of which is incompletely understood. A better understanding of the development of the immune system in premature infants would allow for improved methods to prevent and treat NEC. We propose to use state of the art methods to define the immune system in premature infants in the first two months of life, in order to provide a foundation for further research into the development of treatments for NEC.",Peripheral Immune Development in Premature Infants with  and without NEC,10038410,R21HD102565,"['Abnormal Cell', 'Address', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Birth', 'Blood', 'Blood Volume', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Etiology', 'Eye', 'Fetus', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intestines', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Metadata', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucosal Immune System', 'Mus', 'Natural Immunity', 'Nature', 'Necrotizing Enterocolitis', 'Neonatal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Perinatal', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Secondary to', 'Small Intestines', 'Solid', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'Very Low Birth Weight Infant', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'cell type', 'cost estimate', 'fetal', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'macrophage', 'monocyte', 'mortality', 'peripheral blood', 'premature', 'prevent', 'specific biomarkers', 'therapy development']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,223344,0.060562085069327365
"ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Gestational diabetes (GDM) rates are on the rise in the US, particularly among racial and ethnic minorities. GDM is associated with higher rates of large for gestational age (LGA) infants, C-section, and serious perinatal complications, and increased long-term risks of Type 2 diabetes and morbidity in both mothers and infants. Women who get treatment for GDM are less likely to experience perinatal complications and give birth to LGA infants than those who do not; therefore, rapid detection of GDM may be critical to reducing perinatal complications and disparities in birth outcomes. GDM is normally diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks gestation, but clinically important insulin resistance and metabolic dysfunction may be missed by not testing earlier. A metabolically unhealthy uterine environment in early pregnancy may lead to long-term negative impacts on mother and child, but how and when to test for insulin resistance and associated metabolic dysfunction in pregnancy is poorly defined. More data are needed on how glucose levels and other metabolic measures change across pregnancy to better evaluate women's metabolic risks and how those risks relate to perinatal and long-term outcomes. Using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and metabolic biomarker assays, we will describe detailed metabolic phenotype profiles over the course of pregnancy and examine how they are associated with perinatal and postpartum outcomes. We propose to recruit a diverse sample of 400 women in their first trimester from Kaiser Permanente Northwest and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii and to perform CGM, OGTT, and obtain biomarkers at 12 weeks, 20 weeks, and 28 weeks of gestation to examine how these measures relate to each other and to perinatal outcomes. Aim 1 and Aim 3 will assess the effects of CGM variables (Aim 1) and OGTT and other biomarkers (Aim 3) at each time point on the risk of LGA, other perinatal outcomes, and postpartum diabetes. Aim 2 will assess the relationship between CGM variables and diagnosis of GDM by OGTT, as well as the relationship between CGM variables and other metabolic biomarkers. We hypothesize that dysglycemia is just one marker of a much larger metabolic dysregulation that can be characterized through the work of this consortium. Characterizing a broader spectrum of metabolic dysregulation and its association with adverse perinatal outcomes will lead to improved screening regimens and treatments for pregnant women and better outcomes for both mothers and babies. PROJECT NARRATIVE Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy that increases the risk of pregnancy and birth complications. New tests may allow doctors to identify women with GDM earlier and more accurately than the tests currently being used, but we need to understand them better. We will recruit 400 pregnant women and screen them using both traditional and new GDM screening tools at 12, 20, and 28 weeks of pregnancy to determine how well these tools identify women who are at risk of complications and need treatment.","ChartGlucose4Moms: Characterizing, by Trimester, Continuous Glucose Monitoring Measurements for determining effects on Maternal & Offspring Metabolic Sequelae",10021656,U01DK123791,"['Adipose tissue', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brachial plexus structure', 'C-Peptide', 'C-reactive protein', 'Cesarean section', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dystocia', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fasting', 'First Pregnancy Trimester', 'Fracture', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Glucose', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Hawaii', 'Health', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypertriglyceridemia', 'Infant', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'OGTT', 'Oral Diagnosis', 'Organogenesis', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Perinatal', 'Phenotype', 'Placenta', 'Plasma', 'Postpartum Period', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Pregnant Women', 'Regimen', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Shoulder', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Third Pregnancy Trimester', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'Uterus', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biomarker identification', 'delivery complications', 'early pregnancy', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fetal', 'glucose monitor', 'high risk', 'improved', 'metabolic phenotype', 'metabolic profile', 'mortality', 'neonatal death', 'obesogenic', 'offspring', 'perinatal complications', 'perinatal outcomes', 'postpartum outcome', 'pregnancy hypertension', 'primary outcome', 'racial minority', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'reproductive', 'screening', 'stillbirth', 'tool']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2020,662614,0.01892009811569176
"Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The last months of pregnancy are particularly important for the development of the child's brain, and the consequences of premature birth on its development can be substantial. Prematurely born children are at higher risk of various cognitive impairments and exhibits more behavioral disorders than full-term born children. Thus early detection and management of at risk children are essential. There is growing evidence of significant volumetric abnormalities in subcortical structures of premature neonates, which may be associated to negative long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Understanding these abnormalities could help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology and enable early determination of at-risk patients, both of which would inform the design of novel treatment strategies. However, to date there is still a lack of sensitive, reliable, and accessible algorithms capable of characterizing the influence of prematurity on the anatomy of neonatal brain subcortical structures. In addition, few studies have looked directly at the long-term neurodevelopmental implications of these neonatal subcortical structures abnormalities. Predicting long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes early on – and preferably at neonatal ages – is likely to have a transformative effect on their outcome. Our preliminary data indicate significant morphological differences in the putamen, ventricles, corpus callosum, and thalamus between preterm and term neonates. We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates using brain MRI. These results will further be used in a sparse learning framework to predict long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of prematurity. Hypotheses: By combining subcortical morphological and diffusion properties, we will be able to: (1) delineate specific correlative relationships between structures regionally and differentially affected by normal maturation and different patterns of white matter injury, and (2) improve the specificity of neuroimaging to predict neurodevelopmental outcomes earlier. Aim 1: Build a new toolbox for neonatal subcortical structures analyses that combine 1) a group lasso-based analysis of significant regions of shape changes, 2) a structural correlation network analysis, 3) a neonatal tractography, and 4) tensor-based analysis on tracts. Aim 2: Ascertain biomarkers of prematurity in neonates with different patterns of abnormalities. Aim 3: Assess the predictive potential of imaging and clinical features on neurodevelopmental outcomes among premature children at 12 and 18 months and 6-8 years of age. Impact: This application will provide the first complete subcortical network analysis in both term and preterm neonates. In the first study of its kind for prematurity, we will use sparse and multi-task learning to determine which of the biomarkers of prematurity at birth are the best predictors of long-term outcome. The expected findings could improve our ability to predict these outcomes and enable the design of early treatments – before years of pathological brain development and symptoms occur. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH We propose to develop biomarkers of prematurity by statistically comparing the morphological and diffusion properties of subcortical structures between preterm and term neonates. A better understanding of the neurological biomarkers of prematurity will help promote early clinical management of prematurely born infants who are at higher risk of many neurodevelopmental deficits, including attention deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and various learning impairments (i.e. dyslexia, dysorthographia, dyscalculia).",Predicting the early childhood outcomes of preterm brain shape abnormalities,9994891,R01EB025032,"['8 year old', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain scan', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Child Development', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dyslexia', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Early treatment', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Lasso', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motor', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Problem behavior', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain shape', 'caudate nucleus', 'design', 'early childhood', 'hearing impairment', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'mathematics disability', 'morphometry', 'multi-task learning', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'premature', 'preterm newborn', 'putamen', 'social communication', 'tractography', 'treatment strategy', 'vector', 'white matter', 'white matter injury']",NIBIB,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,448068,0.0016045156709692523
"Role of short chain fatty acids in intestinal barrier maturation in preterm infants PROJECT SUMMARY Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a life-threatening, gastrointestinal (GI) emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. ""Leaky gut"", or intestinal barrier immaturity with elevated intestinal permeability (IP), is the proximate cause of susceptibility to NEC in preterm neonates. Early detection of leaky gut is essential to identify infants at risk for NEC to prevent and reduce disease severity. No clinical factor, routine laboratory test or biomarker alone or in combination have been described that identify preterm neonates with impaired intestinal barrier function who at increased risk for NEC. The goal of this study is to develop a rapid, non-invasive screening tool to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. We recently revealed rapid maturation of the intestinal barrier is strongly associated with clinical factors such as early breastmilk feeding, less antibiotic exposure and later post-menstrual age, and significantly higher abundance and metabolic activities of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium. Although the butyrate producing Clostridiales have been implicated in strengthening the intestinal epithelial barrier and reducing intestinal inflammation, it is unknown whether butyrate and potentially other short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are associated with neonatal intestinal barrier maturation. Our preliminary data revealed butyrate production pathways, in particular Pyruvate/Acetyl-CoA pathway are significantly more abundant in low IP subjects. In this study, we propose to validate a substantiated measure of fecal microbial and/or metabolic biomarkers combined with associated neonatal factors for a rapid, non-invasive screening test. We postulate that the level(s) of metabolic activities, particularly butyrate production and potentially other SCFAs via increased colonization of Clostridiales and Bifidobacterium, are associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates. To address our hypothesis, we will leverage existed stool samples collected from a cohort of ~200 preterms (<33 weeks), for whom both microbiota (16S rRNA gene sequencing) and IP (urine non-metabolized sugar probes lactulose and rhamnose) are available, and propose 2 aims: 1) to determine fecal metabolic activities associated with intestinal barrier maturation in preterm neonates <33 weeks gestation; and 2) to identify and characterize butyrate-producing bacteria associated with intestinal permeability in preterm neonates during the first 7-10 days of life. At the completion of the study, we will determine the biomarkers associated with healthy intestinal barrier functions and the discriminatory scheme for accurate classification of high or low IP group. Our long-term goal is to conduct a randomize clinical trial of rationally designed intervention for NEC early prevention. Refinement of the screening tool will identify infants with aberrant leaky gut, an essential prerequisite for subsequent rational design of novel strategies such as clinical trials of probiotics to promote healthy intestinal barrier functions to reduce NEC incidence. PROJECT NARRATIVE ""Leaky gut"", is the proximate cause of susceptibility to necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a life-threatening, gastrointestinal emergency affecting 7-10% of preterm infants with mortality as high as 30-50%. This proposal will develop and validate a rapid, non-invasive screening test incorporating microbiome-based markers and associated neonatal factors, to identify “at-risk"" preterm infants prior to the onset of NEC. The results of this study will support clinical trials aimed to optimize intestinal maturation and to reduce the burden of NEC complications.
