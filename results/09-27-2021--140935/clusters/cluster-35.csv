"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side. This grant will support training of a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in  computational neuroscience, which has become increasingly important to meet the challenges of  making discoveries with new data analysis tools and of understanding highly nonlinear complex  neural circuits. A salient component of our program is training in the nascent field  of   Computational  Psychiatry,  bridging  basic  neuroscience  and clinical research on mental  disorders. Therefore, the proposed program has the potential of making  a significant impact on  mental health.",Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology,9767751,R90DA043849,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Facebook', 'Faculty', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Occupations', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Side', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'design', 'innovation', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical schools', 'neural circuit', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R90,2019,204981,0.05101702304936782
"NextGen Random Forests Project Summary/Abstract Building from the PI's current R01, we propose next generation random forests (RF) designed for unprecedented accuracy and computational scalability to meet the challenges of today's complex and big data in the health sciences. Superior accuracy is achieved using super greedy trees which circumvent limitations on local adaptivity imposed by classical tree splitting. We identify a key quantity, forest weights, and show how these can be leveraged for further improvements and generalizability. In one application, improved survival estimators are applied to worldwide esophageal cancer data to develop guidelines for clinical decision making. Richer RF inference is another issue explored. Cutting edge machine learning methods rarely consider the problem of estimating variability. For RF, bootstrapping currently exists as the only tool for reliably estimating conﬁdence intervals, but due to heavy computations is rarely applied. We introduce tools to rapidily calculate standard errors based on U-statistic theory. These will be used to increase robustness of esophageal clinical recommendations and to investigate survival temporal trends in cardiovascular disease. In another application, we make use of our new massive data scalability for discovery of tumor and immune regulators of immunotherapy in cancers. This project will set the standard for RF computational performance. Building from the core libraries of the highly accessed R-package randomForestSRC (RF-SRC), software developed under the PIs current R01, we develop open source next generation RF software, RF-SRC Everywhere, Big Data RF-SRC, and HPC RF-SRC. The software will be deployable on a number of popular machine learning workbenches, use distributed data storage technologies, and be optimized for big-p, big-n, and big-np scenarios.

"Genomic sequencing to aid diagnosis in pediatric and prenatal practice: Examining clinical utility, ethical implications, payer coverage, and data integration in a diverse population. PROJECT SUMMARY I propose to gain experience in what are becoming the next big topics in genomic medicine – the integration of “big data” using data science in order to achieve “precision health” – what could be summed up as “data science of the future”. These topics emerge from - but go beyond - the narrower concept of “precision medicine” as the use of genetic information for treatment decisions. The goal is to develop experience in data science and precision health so that my work can serve as a bridge between my field of economics and these fields - and begin to prepare for the future challenges as they emerge. PROJECT NARRATIVE Both data science and precision health will be critical components of future health care interventions and impact patients, providers, and society. “Big Data” using data science includes the aggregation and analysis of data across platforms (includes information from, e.g. genetic testing, biosensors, wearables, and electronic health records, with such data analyzed using, e.g. artificial intelligence and machine learning). Precision Health uses a “big data” approach to focus on disease prevention and detection throughout one’s lifetime.","Genomic sequencing to aid diagnosis in pediatric and prenatal practice: Examining clinical utility, ethical implications, payer coverage, and data integration in a diverse population.",9929780,U01HG009599,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biosensor', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'Future', 'Genetic screening method', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Machine Learning', 'Patients', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Precision Health', 'Provider', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Sum', 'Work', 'data integration', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'formal learning', 'genetic information', 'informal learning', 'precision medicine', 'prenatal']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",U01,2019,166973,0.04505630888020594
"Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design Project Summary/Abstract The next generation of bioengineering and biomedical researchers will have unprecedented access to technologies including wireless health, big data, genetic sequencing, and machine learning approaches to enable modern diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. This presents individuals trained at the interface of technology and biomedicine with an enormous opportunity to address the world’s needs in health and medicine. In the Bioengineering Department at the University of California, Los Angeles, we aim to develop students into leaders able to seamlessly identify clinical needs that technology can address, design and validate solutions that address these needs, communicate with a variety of stakeholders to build teams invested in problem-oriented solutions, and to navigate the regulatory and commercial pathways necessary to enable their technologies to thrive. The Bioengineering Capstone Series at UCLA leverages resources available at UCLA to enable students to: 1) gain insight into clinical needs directly from clinicians and educators across the Ronald Reagan Medical Center, David Geffen School of Medicine, School of Dentistry and UCLA Health System, 2) design their solutions through mentorship from engineering professors, 3) understand the complexities of the biomedical industry with support from the UCLA Technology Development Group and members of the Department of Engineering Industry Advisory Board, 4) utilize modern technologies in wireless health and data science by collaborating with the Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data- to-Knowledge (MD2K) and Mobile Health (mHealth) Institute at UCLA, and 5) work with the National Science Foundation Precise Advanced Technologies and Health Systems for Underserved Populations Engineering Research Center (NSF PATHS- UP ERC) to learn to target and communicate their technologies to maximize societal benefits. Statement of Public Health Relevance: To prepare the next generation of engineers with skills in the design of therapeutics and medical devices, this research education program will provide bioengineering students at UCLA with enhanced opportunities to engage in real world design for biomedical applications. We will guide students through the medical design process from identifying needs, creating solutions which address these needs, and communicating the significance of their contributions to the greater community, ultimately yielding a larger pool of well-trained engineers to address biomedical challenges. !",Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design,9709138,R25EB027626,"['Address', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Technology', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'High School Student', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intellectual Property', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Modernization', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'STEM field', 'School Dentistry', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Students', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinically actionable', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education research', 'engineering design', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'lectures', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'product development', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'skills', 'technology development', 'undergraduate student']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R25,2019,21600,0.04627979357888216
"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems. The primary goal of these training  programs will be to help train a new generation of interdisciplinary neuroscientists with strong  quantitative skills.",INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE,9763514,R90DA023426,"['Appointment', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Minority Recruitment', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Neurosciences', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'bridge program', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'lectures', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'responsible research conduct', 'statistics', 'summer program', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R90,2019,305372,0.07816930715771138
"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio)statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field of health big data. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offers and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will primarily draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from three different departments within three different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science, Medicine, Population Health, Social and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including statistical modeling, data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high- dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and medical imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and success with the current summer program on Big Data led by this team with 164 students trained in the last 4 years (2015-2018) including 90 female students and 30 students from underrepresented minority groups. Fourteen of these participants from the last three years are currently graduate students in Michigan Biostatistics. The ongoing program has gained traction in the national landscape of summer research programs with 20% rate of admission and 80% rate of acceptance among those who are offered this opportunity. The program has consistently received very strong evaluation and our past alumni have become brand ambassadors and advocates for our program. We plan to build on the success and legacy of this program in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2019-2021). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a non-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 45 undergraduates nationally and internationally, with 20 domestic students supported by the requested SIBS funding mechanism and others supported by supplementary institutional and foundation support. We propose to expose the trainees to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of health Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. They will engage in mentored research projects in three primary areas of health big data: Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. Some of the projects will be defined in the area of cardiovascular precision medicine, defined by a team of highly quantitative researchers engaged in cardiovascular research that uses big data. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by U-M researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. We propose an inter-SIBS collaboration with Dordt College summer program trainees who will attend this concluding symposium. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world. We will offer multiple professional development opportunities and resources for graduate school preparation to our trainees so that they can reflect and plan beyond their senior year. All of our proposed activities are reflected through our three specific aims: Teaching, Mentoring and Dissemination. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose a six week long undergraduate summer institute: “Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data” to be held at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, with a group of approximately 45 undergraduate students recruited nationally and internationally, from 2019-2021. Funding is requested for 20 domestic students with supplementary funding expected to be garnered through institutional resources and private foundation support. The program builds on the success of our existing Big Data Summer Institute (BDSI) supported by a NIH BD2K Courses and Skills grant award that is ending in 2018. We plan to expose program students to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data and Human Health. We enhance our ongoing summer program structure in the current proposal by involving a team of researchers working at the intersection of cardiovascular research and data science with a focus on cardiovascular precision medicine where some of the new mentored research projects will be defined. We primarily focus on three genres of health Big Data arising in Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. The trainees will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty from Biostatistics, Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Statistics, Computer Science and Engineering, Information Sciences, Epidemiology and Medicine, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research.

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium Project Summary/Abstract The Arkansas Research Alliance proposes to hold five annual workshops on the subject of bioinformatics. The purpose is to bring six major Arkansas institutions into closer collaboration. Those institutions are: University of Arkansas-Fayetteville; Arkansas State University; University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas at Little Rock; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff; and the National Center for Toxicological Research. The workshops will focus on capabilities at each of the six in sciences related to bioinformatics including artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, food and agriculture, high speed computing, and visualization capabilities. As this work progresses, educational coordination and student encouragement will be important components. Principals from all six institutions are collaborating to accomplish the workshop goals. Project Narrative The FDA ability to protect the public health is directly related to its ability to access and utilize the latest scientific data. Increased proficiency in collecting, presenting, validating, understanding, and drawing quantitative inference from the massive volume of new scientific results is necessary for success in that effort. The complexity involved requires continued development of new tools available and being developed within the realm of information technology, and the workshops proposed here will address this need. Specific Aims  • Thoroughly understand the resources in Arkansas available for furthering the capabilities in  bioinformatics and its associated needs, e.g., access to high speed computing capability and use  of computational tools. • Develop a set of plans to harness and grow those capabilities, especially those that are relevant  to the needs of NCTR and FDA. • Stimulate interest and capability across Arkansas in bioinformatics to produce a larger cadre of  expertise as these plans are implemented. • Enlist NCTR’s help in directing the effort toward seeking local, national and international data  that can be more effectively analyzed to produce results needed by FDA and others, e.g.,  reviewing decades of genomic/treatment data on myeloma patients at the University of  Arkansas for Medical Sciences. • Develop ways in which the Arkansas capabilities can be combined into a coordinated, synergistic  force larger than the sum of its parts. • Encourage students and faculty in the development of new models and techniques to be used in  bioinformatics and related fields. • Improve inter-institutional communication, including developing standardized bioinformatics  curricula and more universal course acceptance.",Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium,9911854,R13FD006690,[' '],FDA,ARKANSAS RESEARCH ALLIANCE,R13,2019,15000,0.04816184483138388
"Conference on Modern Challenges in Imaging in the Footsteps of Allan Cormack Project Summary: Tufts University physics professor Allan Cormack pioneered the field of tomography. His seminal work, from 1963 and 1964, provided both the mathematical foundations of computerized tomography (CT), and tangible proof-of-concept by engineering a rudimentary CT scanner. Taken together, this effort represented the first practical method to ""see into"" an object without physically breaking it open. Along with the engineer Godfrey Hounsfield, he won the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for these contributions. Since then, tomography has broadened to include a wide range of modalities and problems. This field is unique for the rich interplay among applications in medicine, security, earth sciences, industry, physics, and the mathematics required to solve these problems. This international conference at Tufts, “Modern Challenges in Imaging: In the Footsteps of Allan Cormack” will honor the achievements of Cormack and reflect this diversity in the field by gathering top international researchers in mathematics, engineering, science, and medicine to communicate the most current research and challenges in the field. This will include work on mathematical models of emerging modalities, tomographic machine learning, dynamic methods, and spectral imaging with applications include medicine and security. The best research from the conference will be disseminated in a special issue of the journal Inverse Problems. Talks will be posted on the conference website. The organizers will recruit a diverse set of experienced participants and trainees, and the conference will be advertised in a range of publications reflecting the scientific and demographic diversity of the field. This conference is unique in that it combines high-level mathematical participants with experts in medical and industrial CT. It is structured to encourage participants from different fields to talk with each other, broaden their horizons, and make connections between problems and methodologies in the various fields. Several of the plenary talks will provide introductions to the areas. Trainees will be integrated into the conference through an informal welcome lunch and a poster session to introduce them to researchers in the field. This supports goals 1, 4, and 5, of the NIBIB: Researchers will present innovative biomedical technologies, engineering solutions, and mathematical methods to better image the body and objects more generally. The synergy between research areas will support the translation of technologies from the academic sphere to medical utility. The training opportunities for graduate students and beginners support the training of the next generation of diverse scientists. Project Narrative This conference will bring together medical, scientific, engineering, and applied mathematical researchers to present their newest research for a range of tomographic problems. Graduate students and beginners will be encouraged to participate and learn by being offered introductory talks, a student poster session, a welcome event, and an informal atmosphere. The conference will be structured so researchers will learn about important challenges in practical tomography as well as new techniques and methods, thereby creating synergies and research connections among the areas.",Conference on Modern Challenges in Imaging in the Footsteps of Allan Cormack,9837131,R13EB028700,"['Achievement', 'Advertising', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Communication', 'Development', 'Earth science', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Fertilization', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'International', 'Journals', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lightning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Nobel Prize', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Physics', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Security', 'Seminal', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training Support', 'Translations', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Universities', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'higher level mathematics', 'informal atmosphere', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'meetings', 'member', 'next generation', 'posters', 'professor', 'recruit', 'spectrograph', 'symposium', 'synergism', 'tomography', 'training opportunity', 'web site']",NIBIB,TUFTS UNIVERSITY MEDFORD,R13,2019,10000,0.03280039814747851
"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization. Through lectures, hands-on training sessions and team projects, it will empower scientists from a variety of backgrounds in the use of these tools in research on the human brain and on neurological and psychiatric brain disorders.",Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science,9650637,R25MH112480,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Habits', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'design', 'e-science', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'lectures', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'project-based learning', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer institute', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2019,199118,0.07398405399969676
"QuBBD: Statistical & Visualization Methods for PGHD to Enable Precision Medicine  The purpose of this proposal is to develop a combination of innovative statistical and data visualization approaches using patient-generated health data, including mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable devices and smartphones, and patient-reported outcomes, to improve outcomes for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs). This research will offer new insights into how to process and transform patient-generated health data into precise lifestyle recommendations to help achieve remission of symptoms. The specific aims of this research are: 1) To develop new preprocessing methods for publicly available, heterogeneous, time-varied mHealth data to develop a high quality mHealth dataset; 2) To develop and apply novel machine learning methods to obtain accurate predictions and formal statistical inference for the influence of lifestyle features on disease activity in IBDs; and 3) To design and develop innovative, interactive data visualization tools for knowledge discovery. The methods developed in the areas of preprocessing of mHealth data, calibration for mHealth devices, machine learning, and interactive data visualization will be broadly applicable to other mHealth data, chronic conditions beyond IBDs, and other fields in which the data streams are highly variable, intermittent, and periodic. This work is highly relevant to the mission of the NIH BD2K initiative which supports the development of innovative and transformative approaches and tools to accelerate the integration of Big Data and data science into biomedical research. This project will also enhance training in the development and use of methods for biomedical Big Data science and mentor the next generation of multidisciplinary scientists. The proposed research is relevant to public health by seeking to improve symptoms for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, which are chronic, life-long conditions with waxing and waning symptoms. Developing novel statistical and visualization methods to provide a more nuanced understanding of the precise relationship between physical activity and sleep to disease activity is relevant to BD2K's mission.",QuBBD: Statistical & Visualization Methods for PGHD to Enable Precision Medicine ,9741121,R01EB025024,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Imagery', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Life Style Modification', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Activity', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Stream', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'clinical remission', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'mHealth', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'side effect', 'sleep quality', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,281932,0.024844244461148284
"Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the era of newly emerging computational tools for data science, biostatisticians need to play a fundamental role in health sciences research. There is an urgent need to encourage US Citizens and Permanent Residents to pursue graduate training in biostatistics. The design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials and observational studies; the setting of regulatory policy; and the conception of laboratory experiments have been shaped by the fundamental contributions of biostatisticians for decades. Advances in genomics, medical imaging technologies, and computational biology; the increasing emphasis on precision and evidence-based medicine; and the widespread adoption of electronic health records; demand the skills of biostatisticians trained to collaborate effectively in a multidisciplinary environment and to develop statistical and machine learning methods to address the challenges presented by this data-rich revolutionary era of health sciences research. The proposed summer program which includes world-renowned clinical scientists and biostatisticians from two local universities, will provide an immense opportunity for student participants to learn basic yet modern statistical methods that are critical to uncovering new insights from such big and complex biomedical data and also illustrate the potential pitfalls of confounding and bias that may arise when analyzing biomedical data. A unique feature of the proposed training program is thus to expose the participants to not only basic statistical methods but also to the topics of computer science and bioinformatics which will be invaluable in creating the multidisciplinary teams required to tackle the complex research questions that often requires multipronged approaches. The proposed six-week training program will be structured around the NIH's Translation Science Spectrum and will introduce participants to opportunities in biostatistics through the lens of the science advanced by the contributions of biostatisticians. Following an initial set of weeks on basic training of biostatistical methods, the program will culminate in a data hack-a-thon style competition in which participants will employ the statistical and scientific knowledge gained during the program to produce the most innovative, statistically-sound, scientifically-relevant and effectively-communicated response to a set of research questions. The proposed research education program will enroll up to 20 such participants from across the nation and, through lectures, field trips, and opportunities to analyze data from real health sciences, inspire them to pursue graduate training. The program will draw upon considerable past collaborations and complementary resources of two local world-renowned universities to provide participants with an unparalleled view of the field, including award-winning instructors, internationally known methodological and clinical researchers, and a local area rich in opportunities to showcase careers in biostatistics. Special efforts will be made to enroll participants from underrepresented groups. Participants will be followed after completion, and the numbers attending graduate school in statistics and pursuing biostatistics careers will be documented. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biostatisticians are indispensible contributors to health sciences research. The demand for professionals with advanced training in biostatistics is high and will continue to increase, especially with the expanding challenges posed by big biomedical data. This six week summer research education program, a joint effort of North Carolina State University and Duke University, will enroll up to 20 US citizen/permanent resident participants from across the nation in the summers of 2020-2022 and expose them to the opportunities presented by careers in biostatistics and encourage them to seek graduate training in the field.",Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences,9734597,R25HL147228,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Health system', 'Imaging technology', 'Institution', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Names', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'North Carolina', 'Observational Study', 'Participant', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Talents', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'analytical method', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data resource', 'design', 'education research', 'experience', 'field trip', 'graduate student', 'health science research', 'innovation', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interest', 'investigator training', 'laboratory experiment', 'learning strategy', 'lectures', 'lens', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'programs', 'public health research', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'sound', 'statistics', 'summer institute', 'summer program', 'summer research', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NHLBI,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2019,249789,0.07498909722483635
"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program.

"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics. The research proposed will apply novel strategies to further develop integrative machine learning analyses of multidimensional genomic data, discover clinically relevant predictive models, and create computational tools to accelerate future research.",Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models,9901758,R00HG009678,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Advisory Committees', 'Award', 'Bioconductor', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Budgets', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Coupling', 'CpG Island Methylator Phenotype', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yang', 'biomarker performance', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein metabolite', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'tenure track', 'tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R00,2019,249000,0.017405539213028832
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9783829,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'clinical database', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2019,202477,0.020045622576373705
"Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan, 2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E, 2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009). Students from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, Class Store ( CS ) , we propose to transform the way in which students learn Number and Operations in Base Ten. CS will be an engaging, commercially available, classroom-based economy game for tablets and Chromebooks that focuses on multi-digit operations. CS will encourage conceptual understanding and build math self-efficacy for students in grades K-5 within the context of a digital, classroom-based marketplace. Within the game, students will create stores, craft objects to sell, engage in selling/purchasing transactions, and work together to increase the value of the economy. In addition, the game will utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to detect strategies students use and help teachers facilitate rich mathematical discussions thereby enhancing students’ reasoning skills. Outcomes. The proposal will encourage three main outcomes, namely: 1) algorithms for detecting math strategies students use, 2) a discussion support dashboard, and 3) algorithms for predicting at-risk status. A key research aim is to determine whether the software can predict math strategies students use and detect which students are at-risk academically as compared to standardized assessment data, which will help teachers intervene appropriately. The discussion support dashboard will help to promote rich mathematical discussion, thereby improving students’ mathematical justification and conceptual understanding. The engaging game will bolster students’ motivation and self-efficacy in mathematics. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in base ten during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a distal outcome of this proposal is increasing students pursuing careers in STEM. There is an enormous need for students majoring in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), yet lacking a strong foundation in mathematics makes students, especially women, minorities and those from low-income backgrounds, less likely to pursue careers in STEM. Class Store will bolster students’ mathematics abilities, including mathematical reasoning and self-efficacy, in the foundational area of Number and Operations in Base 10 in the short and long term. This will, in turn, lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as increased STEM majors and careers.",Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning,9852112,R44GM130197,"['Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Detection', 'Digit structure', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Marketing', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'STEM field', 'Sales', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self Efficacy', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'field study', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'high school', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'lower income families', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical theory', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'second grade', 'skills', 'student participation', 'success', 'support tools', 'teacher', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2019,413898,0.08204297755904522

"Augmented Reality Platform for Feedback and Assessment in STEM elementary education ABSTRACT This SBIR Phase I project will build evidence-based content, challenges and assessments that promote: simulation-based learning; troubleshooting and critical-thinking; and diversity and inclusion in STEM learning. The approach will be transferable by design to teaching and measuring learner performance across scientific disciplines. Emerging digital content in virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) is already transforming science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education from the abstract and static learning models of the past to the applied and dynamic learning experiences of the future. These technologies have promise in delivering simulation environments capable of nurturing deep learning and higher-level thinking in K-12 students through practical experience, hand-on exercises and real-life applications, such as troubleshooting. Digital AR and VR educational content is beginning to address and develop these skills, but a platform has yet to be developed to effectively enable broad adoption in elementary settings. Cost efficient methods to provide formative feedback and gather summative evaluations for Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) is also an unmet need. The successful completion of the proposed project will provide an evidence-centered content delivery and assessment framework as well as tool for addressing NGSS performance expectations that is transferable across topic areas and readily scalable for large-scale national implementation. The content will intentionally incorporate aspects of context and diversity of characters to ensure inclusion of groups that are historically underrepresented – specifically females and ethnic minorities. NARRATIVE Success in the workforce of the future will require the high-level thinking skills that the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) emphasize. Emerging digital content in virtual (VR) and augmented reality (AR) is transforming science and engineering education from the abstract and static learning models of the past to the applied and dynamic learning experiences of the future, through practical simulation-based experiences, but these lack the capability for performance assessment crucial to teachers and decision makers.

"LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in Biomedical Sciences (BMS) at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) is to enhance the diversity of the research workforce by increasing competitiveness for acceptance and completion of PhD and MD/PhD programs by underrepresented minorities (URM). LSUHSC-NO PREP will accept 39 recent URM baccalaureate science graduates over 5 yrs for intensive research and innovative academic training experi- ences to foster success in BMS doctoral degree programs. Over 300 URM science baccalaureates are award- ed annually to URM students by universities located within 100 miles of LSUHSC-NO representing 32% of all science degrees; however, URM constitute only 10% of enrolled PhD and MD/PhD students nationwide, and 12% at LSUHSC-NO. The PREP will enhance competitiveness for acceptance, retention, and completion of BMS PhD programs by the Scholars by providing 1) intensive research experiences with committed research faculty, and 2) complementary skills development during the 1-yr training. PREP training will focus on building solid foundations in research skills by providing concentrated education in scientific critical thinking, analysis of results, statistics, and writing; inventive and personalized test-taking skills to improve GRE scores and success in graduate courses; oral and poster scientific presentations; responsible and ethical conduct in research; and writing a resume, personal statement, and selecting and applying to graduate schools. Scholars will participate in works-in-progress, journal clubs, and workshops hosted by PREP faculty, visitors, and recruitment contacts; join graduate students in skills development programs; present their research at the annual PREP poster sym- posium and local and national scientific conferences; mentor summer research fellows; and assist in communi- ty science education programs. The PREP will provide forums for the Scholars to engage in research and skills acquisition and active demonstration of knowledge. Over 60 LSUHSC-NO active research faculty, committed to the PREP, have extensive experience in mentoring high school, undergraduate, medical, predoctoral, and postdoctoral students representing URM in the BMS through NIH T32, R25, R35, and other funding mecha- nisms. There are 8 active LSUHSC-NO summer programs which provide research experiences to 75 URM fel- lows annually from which future PREP Scholars will be prescreened and recruited. Scholar recruitment efforts will extend to 4 local historically black colleges and 2 state universities to develop a community-wide mecha- nism to support the URM BMS workforce. The program will be critically evaluated using formative and summa- tive methodologies and descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative statistics to document success. The overall goal is for PREP Scholars to have an enhanced competitiveness for acceptance into rigorous graduate pro- grams with the confidence and essential research skills required to earn a PhD or MD/PhD degree, establish rewarding and successful BMS research careers, and serve as role-models for future URM students. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the LSUHSC-NO PREP is to prepare individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, who have recently completed their baccalaureate science degrees, for successful enrollment, retention, and completion of a PhD or MD-PhD training program. We aim to enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce by preparing PREP Scholars for the rigors and challenges of a biomedical doctoral degree program so that they will successfully obtain a PhD degree or MD/PhD degree and contribute their expertise to the biomedical scientific community.",LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences,9754847,R25GM121189,"['Academic Training', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Basic Science', 'Biomedical Research', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Cities', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Critical Thinking', 'Data Analyses', 'Degree program', 'Dentistry', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Extramural Activities', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Historically Black Colleges and Universities', 'Individual', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Louisiana', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Enrollment', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Oral', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Study Skills', 'Sum', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'education research', 'experience', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'gulf coast', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'invention', 'medical schools', 'member', 'minority communities', 'novel', 'posters', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'recruit', 'role model', 'science education', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer program', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'undergraduate student', 'underrepresented minority student', 'university student']",NIGMS,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R25,2019,308173,0.08436980756972783
"Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     A new electrical biomarker has been identified in high resolution, intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings, called a high frequency oscillation (HFO). Studies have suggested this biomarker has great promise to identify seizure networks and improve surgical outcomes for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, translation of HFOs to clinical practice is hampered by many factors such as spatial, temporal and inter-patient variation in HFO detection rates, false positive and false negative detections, and significant background noise. Big data approaches using large numbers of HFOs acquired from many patients are needed to quantify these effects and allow clinical usage of HFOs. This project details a plan in which the candidate's experience quantifying measurement and detection bias in massive high energy nuclear physics datasets will be combined with a multidisciplinary mentor team to address this problem. The combination of training in computational neuroscience, big data network analysis, and translational neural engineering research will be critical to approach this problem and provide a career trajectory for the candidate. The specific aims of this proposal address three specific confounding factors: 1) the false negative HFO detection rate, 2) variations in HFO features not due to epilepsy, and 3) effects of the state of vigilance on HFOs. Each of these aims involve novel big data methods and/or applications generalizable to other situations: 1) estimating false positive detection rates using a combined experimental/simulated data approach, 2) clustering and classification of distributions of data points, rather than of the data points directly, and 3) a general disambiguation statistic to assess meaningful (rather than statistical) difference between distributions.  The applicant's career goal is to become an academic researcher in the analysis and modeling of intracranial EEG data with a focus on translational epilepsy and sleep physiology research. With the rapid advancement in the resolution of clinical EEG, there is already a strong need for this type of research expertise. Thi grant will provide didactic coursework, formal research and methods training, and career guidance from an expert mentor team. The three mentors have appointments spanning Neurology, Anesthesiology, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The candidate will also build and mentor a research team and establish external collaborations.  The University of Michigan is a premier research university with strong programs and training opportunities in biomedical and physical sciences, engineering, translational and academic research, and advanced research computing. This proposal makes extensive use of the University's large computer cluster. The mentor team and an external collaborator will provide candidate access to prerecorded, deidentified data from over 150 patients, estimated to have over 40 million HFOs. The environment and mentor team will provide the training, facilities, and data for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Recent advances in epilepsy research are generating very large datasets in the search for better ways to identify the region of brain responsible for generating seizures. A particular signa known as High Frequency Oscillations found in high resolution intracranial EEG shows great promise for identifying these regions, but clinicians are unable to use the signal due to confounding biases. This project combines big data processing expertise from particle physics, computer science and machine learning to address these confounds, providing a more accurate process to enable clinical translation of this new biomarker and potentially improve clinical outcomes.",Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy,9752624,K01ES026839,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesiology', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manpower and Training', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Energy', 'Nuclear Physics', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer cluster', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'particle physics', 'patient population', 'patient variability', 'physical science', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'signal processing', 'sleep physiology', 'spatial temporal variation', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'surgery outcome', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'vigilance']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2019,148964,-0.04354084382515068
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9689119,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rice', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'structural genomics', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2019,423432,0.07571843775200461
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the brain is a profound and fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and the public alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. However, much neuroscience is perceived to be too difficult to be taught in school. To make neuroscience more accessible and engaging to students and teachers, Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: fun and affordable robots with camera­eyes, wheels, WiFi and artificial software brains modeled on real biological brains. The neurorobot kit will allow students to investigate meaningful real­world questions about mind, brain and behavior by designing artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. In Phase I of this project, students will work in groups to investigate the question “Why does my dog come to me when I call?” by designing neural networks that make the robot approach when called for. While the robot moves around in the classroom, students will be able to observe its visual sensory input and the flow of activity between its neurons on a smartphone or laptop, and interact with the brain using voice commands and a “reward button” that drives learning. By designing, testing and analysing neurorobot brains, students will acquire a practical understanding of neurons, synapses, neural networks, brain functions, and the relationship between brain and behavior, and develop important computational thinking skills and self­conception as neuroscientists. For Phase I we will develop neurorobot hardware and software, and collaborate with education specialists to develop and evaluate a short high­school instructional unit around neurorobots. Our overall Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and educational value of using neurorobots to teach high­school neuroscience. Our unique combination of low­cost robot hardware, innovative curriculum, and easy­to­use applications makes our product appealing to our large high­school, university, and amateur customer base. For Phase II we will expand the curriculum and the capabilities of our neurorobot kit, and create an online forum where students and teachers can share brains and discuss experiments. Our long­term aim is to encourage education policy makers to adopt neuroscience requirements by demonstrating an effective neuroscience curriculum organized around brain­based neurorobots. By combining neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field that spans biology, medicine, psychology, mathematics, and engineering, with robotics and a project­based approach to learning, our neurorobots and curriculum will improve STEM­education and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: engaging and affordable robots with artificial software brains based on the latest neuroscience research. The robots and associated lesson plans will enable students to learn neuroscience by creating artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. By giving teachers and students access to neurorobotic technologies previously only available in research labs, we aim to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians.",Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots,9763674,R43NS108850,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cellular Phone', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Future Teacher', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Locomotion', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nerve', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Next Generation Science Standards', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Specialist', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain tract', 'commercialization', 'computational reasoning', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'gaze', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'preference', 'project-based learning', 'science education', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'teacher', 'tool', 'twelfth grade']",NINDS,"BACKYARD BRAINS, INC.",R43,2019,312460,0.05620993682180621
"Deep Fractions Learning: A Core Curriculum of Games, Inquiry, and Collaboration There is an enormous deficit in students’ understanding of fractions in the United States. Fifth grade fraction knowledge predicts high school math performance, even when controlling for working memory, whole number knowledge, IQ, reading ability, and demographic factors (Siegler et al., 2012). Therefore, addressing this deficit is a particularly important area for early intervention. With this Fast-Track grant, Deep Fractions Learning , we propose to transform the way in which students learn core math curriculum so that materials are more interactive and engaging, promote deeper learning of content, and are aligned with the Common Core. More specifically, we will develop and evaluate a digital curriculum for grades 3-5 covering the fractions domain that combines games, collaboration, and an inquiry approach. We propose to develop an innovative technology infrastructure that will integrate Teachley learning games, Success for All’s (SFA) cooperative learning framework, and rigorous lesson content. We will integrate research into the design process and work with Johns Hopkins University to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. Outcomes. The intervention will encourage four direct outcomes for students, namely improved: 1) conceptual understanding of fractions, 2) procedural fluency with fractions operations, 3) mathematical justification, and 4) motivation. First, the curriculum will build both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency, providing strong visual models within engaging games that motivate students to practice. The collaborative learning model and inquiry approach will improve students’ mathematical justification. Finally, we encourage these outcomes within a motivational support structure designed to foster engagement and self-efficacy. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in the area of fractions during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since each additional math class students complete in high school more than doubles the odds of college completion (Adelman, 2006), the intervention has the potential to make a real difference in whether students achieve sustainable careers versus being stuck in low-wage jobs. Fractions knowledge in the fifth grade strongly predicts high school math performance, even when controlling for working memory, whole number knowledge, IQ, reading ability, and demographic factors (Siegler et al., 2012). Intervention in this essential content area will improve students’ math ability in the short and long term, which in turn will lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as greater high school graduation rates and college attendance.","Deep Fractions Learning: A Core Curriculum of Games, Inquiry, and Collaboration",9789518,R44GM130162,"['Active Learning', 'Address', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Child', 'Collaborations', 'Common Core', 'Control Groups', 'Demographic Factors', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Graduation Rates', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Infrastructure', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Mathematics Curriculum', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Occupations', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Wages', 'Work', 'boys', 'career', 'college', 'dashboard', 'deep learning', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'girls', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'mathematical ability', 'operation', 'prototype', 'reading ability', 'success', 'teacher', 'third grade', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2019,463456,0.061581939128655845
"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes.

"Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of both existing physical mannequin-based training and virtual media to support clinical learning using Augmented Reality (AR). Significance: Education in clinical settings is often challenging, infeasible, risky, difficult to organize, time-consuming, and expensive. Due to these barriers, the value of mannequin-based simulation is well recognized and is incorporated extensively into medical education. In general, the purpose of mannequin use in education is to simulate a physical ""patient"" on which to learn, demonstrate, and test skill without fear of harming patients prior to entering clinical environments. Despite their substantial benefits, physical mannequins have several fundamental limitations that do not allow them to demonstrate the many unique phases and expressions of a disease or person-to-person differences in anatomy and physiology. This limits the ability for a learner to view dynamic changes over time and to explore disease progression and consequences of interventions. Hypothesis: This research hypothesizes that existing, current mannequins can be enhanced through an innovative and practical Augmented Reality solution. In the Phase I effort a prototype system and sample educational material covering Pressure Ulcer care was developed and analyzed through pilot studies with Nursing educators, Doctoral Degree in Nursing (DNP) students, and pre-licensure students. The pilot results of the technology demonstrated a high degree of positivity and exceptional enthusiasm and all Phase I metrics of success were met or exceeded. Specific Aims: In Phase II the following aims are proposed: 1) Design a comprehensive suite of course content and design the technology's integration into a College of Nursing course, 2) Develop a production-ready system, and 3) Validate the system utility through human subject testing and expert evaluation of the system. Project Narrative Over the past decade, medical simulation has been experiencing explosive growth and widespread adoption. There are now over 800 medical simulation centers in the US alone, located in medical schools, nursing schools, hospitals, military simulation centers, and schools of allied health professions. The global market for Mannequin-Based Simulation is projected to reach $1 Billion by 2020. It is hypothesized that the combination of existing physical mannequin-based training with virtual media will open new possibilities for exploration and enhanced learning interactions for medical education. 3T",Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults,9778054,R44AG057257,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Allied Health Profession', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Augmented Reality', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Course Content', 'Decubitus ulcer', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Materials', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Focus Groups', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Licensure', 'Location', 'Manikins', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Military Personnel', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Nursing Schools', 'Nursing Students', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Skin', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'animation', 'base', 'caregiver education', 'college', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'impression', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'miniaturize', 'person centered', 'pressure', 'professor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'teacher', 'virtual']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2019,779815,0.01706842509740529
"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",9778578,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2019,225000,0.07201494733625811
"Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram Abstract The current project proposes an innovative professional development (PD) program in environmental health research experiences for science high-school teachers from schools with high poverty levels in North Carolina. In a collaborative effort, experts from the College of Education and scientists affiliated with the Center for Human Health and Environment (CHHE), and the Comparative Medicine Institute (CMI) at NC State University will provide teachers (N=40) with unique authentic lab experiences. The 8-week summer research PD program aims at enhancing teachers' environmental health literacy and research skills that will support novel science teaching strategies. The specific aims addressed by the program are the following: 1) to provide teachers with a practical understanding of the scientific method in mentored research projects examining links between environmental stressors and health; 2) to provide teachers with an understanding of core conceptual issues in toxicology; 3) to train teachers in ethical issues in scientific conduct, science communication, and public health; 4) to immerse teachers in authentic research lab experiences by using a cognitive apprenticeship model; and 5) to develop a comprehensive evaluation plan in order to assess the short- and long- term PD outcomes. In the proposed environmental health science (EHS) research PD program, teachers will be integrated into genuine research projects and attend lab meetings, gaining general knowledge of how research is conducted and specialized knowledge related to ongoing projects in their host lab. Additionally, teachers in the program will come together one day per week in a workshop environment, to share their diversity of research experiences and gain additional training in biological concepts and ethical issues related to environmental health sciences. Project Narrative Environmental health research experiences are often inaccessible to high-school teachers, particularly in high-poverty schools. Our PD program will provide teachers with scientific knowledge and resources to improve their classroom instruction by adopting a curriculum grounded in environmental health research. Further, teachers' newly acquired EHS knowledge and research skills have the potential to improve student science learning, and promote interest and readiness for STEM careers. By exposing students to novel instructional strategies, students will acquire not just STEM specialized knowledge, but develop STEM domain identification.

"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9789913,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2019,750000,0.04098763973253483
"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9747912,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'risk prediction model', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2019,168896,0.03378444405133302
"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side. This grant will support training of a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in  computational neuroscience, which has become increasingly important to meet the challenges of  making discoveries with new data analysis tools and of understanding highly nonlinear complex  neural circuits. A salient component of our program is training in the nascent field  of   Computational  Psychiatry,  bridging  basic  neuroscience  and clinical research on mental  disorders. Therefore, the proposed program has the potential of making  a significant impact on  mental health.",Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology,9544939,R90DA043849,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Occupations', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Side', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'design', 'innovation', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical schools', 'neural circuit', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R90,2018,210165,0.05101702304936782

Quarles, Ph.D., Chief Scientist, The Optical Society  2010 Massachusetts Ave, NW, Washington, DC  gquarles@osa.org, 202-416-1954 Project Summary /Abstract:  The 2018 OSA Biophotonics Congress: Biomedical Optics, 3-6 April 2018, Hollywood, FL, consists of four topical meetings. Within this congress, the Optics and the Brain Conference is specifically focused on cutting-edge research and innovative new tools and techniques that seek to increase fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system. This proposal is to provide registration and travel support for students, early career professionals, and underrepresented speakers that will present on optics and the brain topics within this meeting.  The 2018 OSA Optics and the Brain conference was founded in 2015 in response to the USA BRAIN Initiative and the European Human Brain Project. These initiatives have identified the urgent need for new technologies that can probe the working brain across all levels from single neurons to entire behaving organisms. Optics offers a unique toolkit for multiscale imaging the living and intact brain, while new genetic labeling strategies provide optical contrast to neural function and optogenetics permits the control of cellular function with light. Optics and the Brain is thus an important, highly interdisciplinary area of research that combines broad aspects of neuroscience, biology, medicine, physics, chemistry and engineering. This year the program is adding more topics to be able to better explore new tools, the use of artificial intelligence in machine learning and technologies that will allow doctors to explore larger, deeper sections of the brain.  The general purpose of this congress with co-located meetings is to create an inclusive, open forum for the presentation of high-quality scientific research through plenary and technical sessions, short courses, panels, networking and special events. This method of face-to-face information sharing allows researchers to learn what others in their field and related disciplines are doing and to efficiently learn about new research, tools, and techniques that might be relevant to their work. It allows conversations with colleagues from different institutions around the world and engenders far reaching scientific collaborations – both domestic and international. In addition, this meeting provides an opportunity for students and early career professionals to present their work, participate in professional development activities, and to hear from and network with internationally-renowned invited speakers who represent the broad diversity of optics and the brain related research. Ultimately this meeting, where best-in-class research is presented and discussed will advance knowledge in the field of biomedical optics and biophotonics and propel technological development forward.

"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems. The primary goal of these training  programs will be to help train a new generation of interdisciplinary neuroscientists with strong  quantitative skills.",INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE,9548637,R90DA023426,"['Appointment', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Minority Recruitment', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Neurosciences', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'bridge program', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'lectures', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'responsible research conduct', 'statistics', 'summer program', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R90,2018,305372,0.07816930715771138
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans.

"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"NextGen Random Forests Project Summary/Abstract Building from the PI's current R01, we propose next generation random forests (RF) designed for unprecedented accuracy and computational scalability to meet the challenges of today's complex and big data in the health sciences. Superior accuracy is achieved using super greedy trees which circumvent limitations on local adaptivity imposed by classical tree splitting. We identify a key quantity, forest weights, and show how these can be leveraged for further improvements and generalizability. In one application, improved survival estimators are applied to worldwide esophageal cancer data to develop guidelines for clinical decision making. Richer RF inference is another issue explored. Cutting edge machine learning methods rarely consider the problem of estimating variability. For RF, bootstrapping currently exists as the only tool for reliably estimating conﬁdence intervals, but due to heavy computations is rarely applied. We introduce tools to rapidily calculate standard errors based on U-statistic theory. These will be used to increase robustness of esophageal clinical recommendations and to investigate survival temporal trends in cardiovascular disease. In another application, we make use of our new massive data scalability for discovery of tumor and immune regulators of immunotherapy in cancers. This project will set the standard for RF computational performance. Building from the core libraries of the highly accessed R-package randomForestSRC (RF-SRC), software developed under the PIs current R01, we develop open source next generation RF software, RF-SRC Everywhere, Big Data RF-SRC, and HPC RF-SRC. The software will be deployable on a number of popular machine learning workbenches, use distributed data storage technologies, and be optimized for big-p, big-n, and big-np scenarios.

"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization.

"QuBBD: Statistical & Visualization Methods for PGHD to Enable Precision Medicine  The purpose of this proposal is to develop a combination of innovative statistical and data visualization approaches using patient-generated health data, including mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable devices and smartphones, and patient-reported outcomes, to improve outcomes for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs). This research will offer new insights into how to process and transform patient-generated health data into precise lifestyle recommendations to help achieve remission of symptoms. The specific aims of this research are: 1) To develop new preprocessing methods for publicly available, heterogeneous, time-varied mHealth data to develop a high quality mHealth dataset; 2) To develop and apply novel machine learning methods to obtain accurate predictions and formal statistical inference for the influence of lifestyle features on disease activity in IBDs; and 3) To design and develop innovative, interactive data visualization tools for knowledge discovery. The methods developed in the areas of preprocessing of mHealth data, calibration for mHealth devices, machine learning, and interactive data visualization will be broadly applicable to other mHealth data, chronic conditions beyond IBDs, and other fields in which the data streams are highly variable, intermittent, and periodic. This work is highly relevant to the mission of the NIH BD2K initiative which supports the development of innovative and transformative approaches and tools to accelerate the integration of Big Data and data science into biomedical research. This project will also enhance training in the development and use of methods for biomedical Big Data science and mentor the next generation of multidisciplinary scientists. The proposed research is relevant to public health by seeking to improve symptoms for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, which are chronic, life-long conditions with waxing and waning symptoms.

"2018 Image Science Gordon Research Conference & Gordon Research Seminar Project Summary: The proposal requests support for early-career investigators to attend the 2018 Gordon Research Conference on Image Science. The unique feature of this conference in its third offering compared with others in medical imaging is the bringing together of renown speakers from disparate application areas, including astronomy, biology, medicine, remote sensing, and security and defense industries, in a forum that encourages each to describe their greatest challenges and most promising solutions. All speakers are invited based on their leadership in their field and their willingness to debate fundamental issues shared by everyone developing, evaluating, and applying imaging in medicine and biology. We believe the GRC format placed in the context of a small-college venue promotes the type of innovative interdisciplinary thinking that leads to breakthroughs. An environment where leading senior scientists debate core issues is valuable to young investigators trying to build successful independent careers in medical imaging in industry and academia. All attendees are invited to present a poster describing their research in poster sessions that are a key element of the Gordon Conference format. The June 17-22, 2018 GRC conference theme is “Image Science: Creating Knowledge from Information,” which is focused on appropriate acquisition and efficient uses of the massive volume of imaging information now collected from patients. Speakers give 40 minutes presentations in a single-track format with 20 minute discussions following each presentation that are led by experts in the field. Topic range from “Imaging in Brain Science Discovery” to “Advanced Machine Learning” and “Computational Imaging.” At the center of each presentation is a discussion of the core challenges shared by image scientists and novel techniques for acquiring and displaying information in a manner that maximizes decision performance. Given the success of the previous meeting, we will hold the first-ever, student-run Gordon Research Seminars (GRS) on Image Science June 16, 17, 2018. Our aim is to build Image Science as an independent field of study through detailed interdisciplinary discussions and by fostering the success of a new generation of image scientists. Project Narrative: Solutions to very difficult problems often emerge from discussions among experts in different fields of study being challenged by the same core problems. The 2018 GRC on Imaging Science strives to build a community of problem solvers by creating an environment for detailed discussions among senior investigators that involves young investigators at a time when they are building careers.

"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9523223,K01ES025442,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human model', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,144298,0.04319275949105305
"Fisk University/UIUC-Mayo KnowENG BD2K Center R25 Partnership ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the proposed Fisk- UIUC KnowEnG R25 program is to recruit and retain a cadre of under-represented minority scientists prepared to compete for PhD training in biomedical research with already acquired confidence in the use of Big Data. The proposed partnership with the KnowEnG BD2K Center at UIUC will permit curricular enhancements and summer research opportunities for Fisk trainees while, at the same time, reciprocally training natural scientists and mathematics majors in complementary computer and informatics sciences and providing computer science and mathematics undergraduates with essential systems, molecular and cell biology/biochemistry background at Fisk University to provide context for cutting edge genomics, proteomics, and individualized medicine research reliant on Big Data. In addition to curricular and research training program elements, Fisk students will have remote access to seminar courses to increase efficacy in communicating BD2K-based technologies and their applications. Didactic work and undergraduate research experiences will be complemented by an individualized student development plan for honing professional skills, deep understanding of the responsible conduct of research, and wrap-around mentoring to assure subsequent successful entry into competitive BD2K aligned PhD-granting programs. UIUC-hosted summer workshops for faculty will increase confidence in use of Big Data tools, leading to innovations in STEM courses that embrace Big Data, impacting all Fisk STEM undergraduates. Research collaborations between Fisk and BD2K partner faculty also will be fostered. The aims to achieve the goals are: 1) Implement an integrated didactic program to enhance student self-efficacy with computational and informatics tool development and use for interrogating and interpreting Big Data, including a two-semester bioinformatics course in Bioinformatics, informed by the expertise of UIUC KnowEnG BD2K Center faculty with additional Special Topics courses available remotely from UIUC. 2) Develop an integrated academic year (Fisk, or partners) and summer research program at the UIUC KnowEnG BD2K Center to assure student exposure to a participation in the life cycle of a `Big Data' research problem. 3) Implement a professional skills development program that assures successful transition of undergraduate participants to a Ph.D. (or MD/PhD Program) in Big Data- reliant biomedical research. 4) Launch a faculty development program in bioinformatics that leads to embracing Big Data problems in courses in multiple disciplines for impact on all Fisk undergraduate STEM majors. The proposed program will increase both didactic and research experiences in Big Data for Fisk University undergraduates while preparing them for successful entry into PhD-granting programs in related disciplines at research intensive universities. Our KnowEnG partnership also will increase Fisk faculty capacity in Big Data use and foster faculty research collaborations, thus introducing Big Data into course-embedded research, impacting all Fisk University STEM Majors. Reciprocally, our KnowEnG UIUC faculty partners will enrich their holistic mentoring skills of URM trainees based on interactions with Fisk R25 mentors, of value for their broader education and research training goals at UIUC and Mayo. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The overall goal of the proposed Fisk- UIUC KnowEnG R25 program is to recruit and retain a cadre of under-represented minority scientists prepared to compete for PhD training in biomedical research with already acquired confidence in the use of Big Data. The proposed partnership with the KnowEnG BD2K Center at UIUC will permit curricular enhancements and summer research opportunities for Fisk trainees while, at the same time, reciprocally training natural scientists and mathematics majors in complementary computer and informatics sciences and providing computer science and mathematics undergraduates with essential systems, molecular and cell biology/biochemistry background at Fisk University to provide context for cutting edge genomics, proteomics, and individualized medicine research reliant on Big Data. In addition to curricular and research training program elements, Fisk students will have remote access to seminar courses to increase efficacy in communicating BD2K-based technologies and their applications. Didactic work and undergraduate research experiences will be complemented by an individualized student development plan for honing professional skills, deep understanding of the responsible conduct of research, and wrap-around mentoring to assure subsequent successful entry into competitive BD2K aligned PhD-granting programs. UIUC-hosted summer workshops for faculty will increase confidence in use of Big Data tools, leading to innovations in STEM courses that embrace Big Data, impacting all Fisk STEM undergraduates. Research collaborations between Fisk and BD2K partner faculty also will be fostered.

"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This program focuses on the development and dissemination of online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health.

"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics. The research proposed will apply novel strategies to further develop integrative machine learning analyses of multidimensional genomic data, discover clinically relevant predictive models, and create computational tools to accelerate future research.",Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models,9526698,K99HG009678,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Advisory Committees', 'Award', 'Bioconductor', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Budgets', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Coupling', 'CpG Island Methylator Phenotype', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yang', 'biomarker performance', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein metabolite', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'tenure track', 'tool']",NHGRI,HUDSON-ALPHA INSTITUTE FOR BIOTECHNOLOGY,K99,2018,112117,0.017405539213028832
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9774474,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biomarker development', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2018,200616,0.020045622576373705

"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II Project Summary Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Clinical performance assessment emphasizes learner evaluation over learner development, lacks rigor and utility for developmental purposes, and clinical teachers have expressed particular difficulty with diagnosing reasoning deficits for remediation purposes. Further, medical students' diagnostic reasoning does not improve over the course of clinical training and senior medical students have highly variable diagnostic performance that is often rated below expectations according to theory-based and validated scoring criteria. Independent practice does not necessarily enhance the context for clinical reasoning; the majority of physicians' medical errors are thought to be diagnostic in nature. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Improve reliability of human scoring of DXJ essays. 2) Extend the automated scoring algorithms. 3) Automated reasoning failure categorization and remediation. 4) Complete the software development required for delivering the commercial product. 5) Evaluate predictive validity of automatically scored DXJ essays. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine. Project Narrative Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.","Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II",9537633,R42GM108104,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Case Based Learning', 'Case Study', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Community Health Education', 'Competence', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Incubators', 'Instruction', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Schedule', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Teaching Method', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'educational atmosphere', 'essays', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'software development', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'undergraduate medical education', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"PARALLEL CONSULTING, LLC",R42,2018,489952,0.02826231884921514
"MICCAI 2018 - 21th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Project Summary The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) society is dedicated to the promotion, preservation, facilitation of research and education in the fields of medical image computing (MIC) and computer assisted interventions (CAI) including biomedical imaging and robotics; this is achieved through the organization and operation of regular international conferences of highest quality and publications which promote and foster the exchange and dissemination of advanced knowledge, expertise and experience in the field produced by leading institutions and outstanding scientists, physicians, and educators around the world. MICCAI Conferences have their roots and origin in three separate but related conferences beginning in early 1990s, the Visualization in Biomedical Computing (VBC), Computer Vision and Virtual Reality in Robotics and Medicine (CVRMed), and Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery (MRCAS), which merged into a single annual conference in 1998. MICCAI Conferences have defined a new scientific discipline over the years and have become the premier conference in the field with their proceedings having an impact factor comparable to high-impact computational journals. Conference topics include, computer vision & image processing for medical imaging, computer-aided diagnosis, computer-assisted intervention & surgery, guidance systems & robotics, visualization and virtual reality, bioscience and biology applications, specific imaging systems and new biomedical imaging applications, spanning disciplines such as radiology, pathology, surgery, oncology, cardiology, physiology, and psychiatry. The main MICCAI conference includes three days of oral presentations and poster sessions. The quality and importance of poster presentations are considered to be on a par with those of oral presentations, with both undergoing a rigorous double-blinded peer-review (~30% acceptance) and several presented papers becoming landmark publications over the years reaching up to 2,000 citations. The conference series includes community-driven software challenges, workshops and tutorials just before and/or after the main conference. These satellite events focus in detail on the current status and advances in topics relevant to MICCAI and are very highly attended. The MICCAI Conferences span the entire globe and are usually rotated among the American, European, and Asian continents. Attendance typically includes more than 45 countries, with strong student representation (~40%). The MICCAI 2018 Conference will be held in Granada, Spain in September 16th-20th, 2018. An innovative aspect of MICCAI 2018 is the initiation of a “Mentoring Program” to connect students and young investigators with established mentors from academia and industry. Along with the mission of “Women in MICCAI” committee, this proposal requests funds to initiate and ultimately sustain student travel awards to specifically enhance diversity in conference attendance, including women, underrepresented minorities, students with disabilities, and students from disadvantaged backgrounds, to present their work, providing them with a unique opportunity to reach an international audience for career development and collaborations. Project Narrative The MICCAI 2018 Conference will be held in Granada, Spain during September 16th-20th, 2018. The MICCAI conferences are the premier meeting in the medical image computing (MIC) and computer assisted intervention (CAI) communities, having introduced several landmark papers and providing a springboard for young scientists to establish themselves in the field. This proposal requests funds to provide travel awards for students, focusing on enhancing diversity by supporting the participation of women, underrepresented minorities, students with disabilities, and from disadvantaged backgrounds, to present their work, providing them with an opportunity for visibility in an established international audience, foster professional development and collaborations.",MICCAI 2018 - 21th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention,9617533,R13CA225202,"['Academia', 'Address', 'American', 'Area', 'Asians', 'Award', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Cardiology', 'Climate', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Computer-Assisted Surgery', 'Country', 'Development', 'Disadvantaged', 'Discipline', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Education', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Event', 'Female', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Imagery', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Minority', 'Mission', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Paper', 'Pathology', 'Peer Review', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Plant Roots', 'Policies', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Recording of previous events', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Robotics', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Sex Bias', 'Societies', 'Spain', 'Students', 'System', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'career development', 'community intervention', 'computer science', 'design', 'digital imaging', 'disabled students', 'disadvantaged student', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lecture notes', 'meetings', 'new technology', 'oncology', 'operation', 'peer', 'posters', 'preservation', 'programs', 'prototype', 'racial and ethnic', 'research and development', 'social', 'symposium', 'underrepresented minority student', 'virtual reality', 'women faculty']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R13,2018,5000,0.03917786888153884
"LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in Biomedical Sciences (BMS) at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) is to enhance the diversity of the research workforce by increasing competitiveness for acceptance and completion of PhD and MD/PhD programs by underrepresented minorities (URM). LSUHSC-NO PREP will accept 39 recent URM baccalaureate science graduates over 5 yrs for intensive research and innovative academic training experi- ences to foster success in BMS doctoral degree programs. Over 300 URM science baccalaureates are award- ed annually to URM students by universities located within 100 miles of LSUHSC-NO representing 32% of all science degrees; however, URM constitute only 10% of enrolled PhD and MD/PhD students nationwide, and 12% at LSUHSC-NO. The PREP will enhance competitiveness for acceptance, retention, and completion of BMS PhD programs by the Scholars by providing 1) intensive research experiences with committed research faculty, and 2) complementary skills development during the 1-yr training. PREP training will focus on building solid foundations in research skills by providing concentrated education in scientific critical thinking, analysis of results, statistics, and writing; inventive and personalized test-taking skills to improve GRE scores and success in graduate courses; oral and poster scientific presentations; responsible and ethical conduct in research; and writing a resume, personal statement, and selecting and applying to graduate schools. Scholars will participate in works-in-progress, journal clubs, and workshops hosted by PREP faculty, visitors, and recruitment contacts; join graduate students in skills development programs; present their research at the annual PREP poster sym- posium and local and national scientific conferences; mentor summer research fellows; and assist in communi- ty science education programs. The PREP will provide forums for the Scholars to engage in research and skills acquisition and active demonstration of knowledge. Over 60 LSUHSC-NO active research faculty, committed to the PREP, have extensive experience in mentoring high school, undergraduate, medical, predoctoral, and postdoctoral students representing URM in the BMS through NIH T32, R25, R35, and other funding mecha- nisms. There are 8 active LSUHSC-NO summer programs which provide research experiences to 75 URM fel- lows annually from which future PREP Scholars will be prescreened and recruited. Scholar recruitment efforts will extend to 4 local historically black colleges and 2 state universities to develop a community-wide mecha- nism to support the URM BMS workforce. The program will be critically evaluated using formative and summa- tive methodologies and descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative statistics to document success. The overall goal is for PREP Scholars to have an enhanced competitiveness for acceptance into rigorous graduate pro- grams with the confidence and essential research skills required to earn a PhD or MD/PhD degree, establish rewarding and successful BMS research careers, and serve as role-models for future URM students. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the LSUHSC-NO PREP is to prepare individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, who have recently completed their baccalaureate science degrees, for successful enrollment, retention, and completion of a PhD or MD-PhD training program. We aim to enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce by preparing PREP Scholars for the rigors and challenges of a biomedical doctoral degree program so that they will successfully obtain a PhD degree or MD/PhD degree and contribute their expertise to the biomedical scientific community.",LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences,9566214,R25GM121189,"['Academic Training', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Basic Science', 'Biomedical Research', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Cities', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Critical Thinking', 'Data Analyses', 'Degree program', 'Dentistry', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Extramural Activities', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Historically Black Colleges and Universities', 'Individual', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Louisiana', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Enrollment', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Oral', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Study Skills', 'Sum', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'education research', 'experience', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'gulf coast', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'invention', 'medical schools', 'member', 'minority communities', 'novel', 'posters', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'recruit', 'role model', 'science education', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer program', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'undergraduate student', 'underrepresented minority student', 'university student']",NIGMS,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R25,2018,235732,0.08436980756972783
"Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     A new electrical biomarker has been identified in high resolution, intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings, called a high frequency oscillation (HFO). Studies have suggested this biomarker has great promise to identify seizure networks and improve surgical outcomes for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, translation of HFOs to clinical practice is hampered by many factors such as spatial, temporal and inter-patient variation in HFO detection rates, false positive and false negative detections, and significant background noise. Big data approaches using large numbers of HFOs acquired from many patients are needed to quantify these effects and allow clinical usage of HFOs. This project details a plan in which the candidate's experience quantifying measurement and detection bias in massive high energy nuclear physics datasets will be combined with a multidisciplinary mentor team to address this problem. The combination of training in computational neuroscience, big data network analysis, and translational neural engineering research will be critical to approach this problem and provide a career trajectory for the candidate. The specific aims of this proposal address three specific confounding factors: 1) the false negative HFO detection rate, 2) variations in HFO features not due to epilepsy, and 3) effects of the state of vigilance on HFOs. Each of these aims involve novel big data methods and/or applications generalizable to other situations: 1) estimating false positive detection rates using a combined experimental/simulated data approach, 2) clustering and classification of distributions of data points, rather than of the data points directly, and 3) a general disambiguation statistic to assess meaningful (rather than statistical) difference between distributions.  The applicant's career goal is to become an academic researcher in the analysis and modeling of intracranial EEG data with a focus on translational epilepsy and sleep physiology research. With the rapid advancement in the resolution of clinical EEG, there is already a strong need for this type of research expertise. Thi grant will provide didactic coursework, formal research and methods training, and career guidance from an expert mentor team. The three mentors have appointments spanning Neurology, Anesthesiology, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The candidate will also build and mentor a research team and establish external collaborations.  The University of Michigan is a premier research university with strong programs and training opportunities in biomedical and physical sciences, engineering, translational and academic research, and advanced research computing. This proposal makes extensive use of the University's large computer cluster. The mentor team and an external collaborator will provide candidate access to prerecorded, deidentified data from over 150 patients, estimated to have over 40 million HFOs. The environment and mentor team will provide the training, facilities, and data for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Recent advances in epilepsy research are generating very large datasets in the search for better ways to identify the region of brain responsible for generating seizures. A particular signa known as High Frequency Oscillations found in high resolution intracranial EEG shows great promise for identifying these regions, but clinicians are unable to use the signal due to confounding biases. This project combines big data processing expertise from particle physics, computer science and machine learning to address these confounds, providing a more accurate process to enable clinical translation of this new biomarker and potentially improve clinical outcomes.",Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy,9534672,K01ES026839,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesiology', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manpower and Training', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Energy', 'Nuclear Physics', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer cluster', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'particle physics', 'patient population', 'patient variability', 'physical science', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'signal processing', 'spatial temporal variation', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'surgery outcome', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'vigilance']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2018,148964,-0.04354084382515068
"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9535990,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2018,169112,0.03378444405133302
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9479717,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Expression Profiling', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2018,423431,0.07571843775200461
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9542295,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'models and simulation', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online resource', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'social', 'social model', 'societal costs', 'surgery outcome', 'tool', 'visiting scholar', 'wearable device']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2018,955747,0.05806508921011966
"Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    My goal in seeking a K01 Award is to acquire the necessary training to become an independently funded investigator focused on exploiting the power of biomedical Big Data Science to improve outcome following severe injury. I am a trauma surgeon at San Francisco General Hospital, one of the Nation's leading trauma centers, and an Assistant Professor of Surgery at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). UCSF has recently entered into collaboration with the National Laboratories to study the use of biomedical Big Data in complex clinical conditions and my main mentor, Dr. Mitchell J. Cohen is the lead investigator at UCSF for this collaboration. I believe that given the complexity of the factors that likely affect traum outcome including patient injury patterns, medical co-morbidities, patient biology, and the system of care, trauma provides a solid foundation to study the utility of Big Data Science for solving complex medical questions. To facilitate my growth as an expert in this field, I am proposing to develop a framework for integrating multiple data sources necessary to forecast patient outcomes following trauma. These novel datasets combined with biologic and metadata will then be utilized to create improved metrics that better predict complication risk from modifiable and non-modifiable factors. The net result of this work is a new approach to data ascertainment for measuring outcome, leveraging new data types to improve prediction of patient trajectory, and creating a platform to interface with existing information technology to ultimately be used for an early warning detection system for patients at risk of complications. The future long-term goal of this work would be to identify early patients predicted to do more poorly and then apply refinements to the process of care to minimize complication development. The creation of early warning detection systems has significant theoretic potential to improve quality and ultimately decrease costs. Nearly $30 billion per year in the US is spent on care for the traumatically injured and the development of post-traumatic complications is believed to be major contributor to the overall costs of care. The ability to report performance has been hampered by a lack of standard definitions, reporting bias, access to datasets, and the analysis techniques that fail to account for the highly confounded relationships contributing to patient outcome. This K01 award will provide me with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in applying biologic big data to trauma care (2) to elucidate the relationship of modifiable factors affecting complication development (3) to gain experience with advanced biostatistical techniques and bioinformatics; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary team including Dr. Cohen, a National expert in trauma systems biology and biologic big data, and two co-mentors: Dr. Michael Matthay, a translational research expert in complications after severe illness, and Dr. Alan Hubbard, an expert in advanced biostatistical techniques including biologic big data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    In the US, trauma is the leading cause of death for those under 45 years old and many of the patients who survive their initial injuries develop complications such as blood clots or pneumonia that contribute to both death and the long-term effects of the trauma. Through leveraging the power of biomedical Big Data, an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing integrated EMR early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early with the intent to ultimately refie the process of care for this group to minimize complication development.",Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data,9530647,K01ES026834,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood coagulation', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deltastab', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'care costs', 'care systems', 'career', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'injured', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'smartphone Application', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2018,221740,0.049500250646782276
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.

"Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding the brain is a profound and fascinating challenge, captivating the scientific community and the public alike. The lack of effective treatment for most brain disorders makes the training of the next generation of neuroscientists, engineers and physicians a key concern. However, much neuroscience is perceived to be too difficult to be taught in school. To make neuroscience more accessible and engaging to students and teachers, Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: fun and affordable robots with camera­eyes, wheels, WiFi and artificial software brains modeled on real biological brains. The neurorobot kit will allow students to investigate meaningful real­world questions about mind, brain and behavior by designing artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. In Phase I of this project, students will work in groups to investigate the question “Why does my dog come to me when I call?” by designing neural networks that make the robot approach when called for. While the robot moves around in the classroom, students will be able to observe its visual sensory input and the flow of activity between its neurons on a smartphone or laptop, and interact with the brain using voice commands and a “reward button” that drives learning. By designing, testing and analysing neurorobot brains, students will acquire a practical understanding of neurons, synapses, neural networks, brain functions, and the relationship between brain and behavior, and develop important computational thinking skills and self­conception as neuroscientists. For Phase I we will develop neurorobot hardware and software, and collaborate with education specialists to develop and evaluate a short high­school instructional unit around neurorobots. Our overall Phase I goal is to demonstrate the feasibility and educational value of using neurorobots to teach high­school neuroscience. Our unique combination of low­cost robot hardware, innovative curriculum, and easy­to­use applications makes our product appealing to our large high­school, university, and amateur customer base. For Phase II we will expand the curriculum and the capabilities of our neurorobot kit, and create an online forum where students and teachers can share brains and discuss experiments. Our long­term aim is to encourage education policy makers to adopt neuroscience requirements by demonstrating an effective neuroscience curriculum organized around brain­based neurorobots. By combining neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field that spans biology, medicine, psychology, mathematics, and engineering, with robotics and a project­based approach to learning, our neurorobots and curriculum will improve STEM­education and inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians. PROJECT NARRATIVE Backyard Brains is developing neurorobots for education: engaging and affordable robots with artificial software brains based on the latest neuroscience research. The robots and associated lesson plans will enable students to learn neuroscience by creating artificial brains that make the robot’s behavior life­like, sensory­guided and goal­directed. By giving teachers and students access to neurorobotic technologies previously only available in research labs, we aim to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and physicians.",Introducing Neuroscience and Neurocomputation Concepts to High School Students using Brain-based Neurorobots,9622419,R43NS108850,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attitude', 'Auditory', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Binocular Vision', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cellular Phone', 'Color', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Conceptions', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Eye', 'Future Teacher', 'Goals', 'High School Student', 'Instruction', 'Interneurons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Locomotion', 'Mathematics', 'Medicine', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Nerve', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Next Generation Science Standards', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Policy Maker', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Rewards', 'Robot', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Specialist', 'Students', 'Synapses', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visual', 'Voice', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain tract', 'commercialization', 'computational reasoning', 'cost', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'gaze', 'graphical user interface', 'handheld mobile device', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laptop', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'preference', 'project-based learning', 'science education', 'sensor', 'sensory input', 'skills', 'sound', 'success', 'teacher', 'tool', 'twelfth grade']",NINDS,"BACKYARD BRAINS, INC.",R43,2018,386013,0.05620993682180621
"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes.

"Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram Abstract The current project proposes an innovative professional development (PD) program in environmental health research experiences for science high-school teachers from schools with high poverty levels in North Carolina. In a collaborative effort, experts from the College of Education and scientists affiliated with the Center for Human Health and Environment (CHHE), and the Comparative Medicine Institute (CMI) at NC State University will provide teachers (N=40) with unique authentic lab experiences. The 8-week summer research PD program aims at enhancing teachers' environmental health literacy and research skills that will support novel science teaching strategies. The specific aims addressed by the program are the following: 1) to provide teachers with a practical understanding of the scientific method in mentored research projects examining links between environmental stressors and health; 2) to provide teachers with an understanding of core conceptual issues in toxicology; 3) to train teachers in ethical issues in scientific conduct, science communication, and public health; 4) to immerse teachers in authentic research lab experiences by using a cognitive apprenticeship model; and 5) to develop a comprehensive evaluation plan in order to assess the short- and long- term PD outcomes. In the proposed environmental health science (EHS) research PD program, teachers will be integrated into genuine research projects and attend lab meetings, gaining general knowledge of how research is conducted and specialized knowledge related to ongoing projects in their host lab. Additionally, teachers in the program will come together one day per week in a workshop environment, to share their diversity of research experiences and gain additional training in biological concepts and ethical issues related to environmental health sciences. Project Narrative Environmental health research experiences are often inaccessible to high-school teachers, particularly in high-poverty schools. Our PD program will provide teachers with scientific knowledge and resources to improve their classroom instruction by adopting a curriculum grounded in environmental health research. Further, teachers' newly acquired EHS knowledge and research skills have the potential to improve student science learning, and promote interest and readiness for STEM careers. By exposing students to novel instructional strategies, students will acquire not just STEM specialized knowledge, but develop STEM domain identification. This is particularly important for science, given the fact that students from high- poverty schools are economically disadvantaged and may comprise a large proportion of individuals from minority groups that are underrepresented in science.",Environmental Health Research Experiences for Teachers in High-Poverty Schools: A Professional DevelopmentProgram,9458539,R25ES028974,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biomedical Research', 'Case Study', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Economically Deprived Population', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High School Faculty', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'K-12 Faculty', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'North Carolina', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Areas', 'Predisposition', 'Program Development', 'Program Evaluation', 'Public Health', 'Readiness', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'STEM career', 'School Teachers', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Teaching Method', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'apprenticeship', 'base', 'college', 'comparative', 'deep learning', 'design', 'environmental stressor', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'exposure route', 'health literacy', 'health science research', 'high school program', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'laboratory experience', 'meetings', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outreach', 'pedagogical content', 'programs', 'response', 'science teacher', 'skills', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'socioeconomic disparity', 'stressor', 'summer research', 'teacher', 'tool']",NIEHS,NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY RALEIGH,R25,2018,99506,0.059168211573983304
"Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society. Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9593059,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data management', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2018,750000,0.04098763973253483
"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,9215686,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Mathematics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'student training', 'teaching assistant', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2017,59383,0.03831810594147258
"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The Training Program in Computational Neuroscience (TPCN) will support integrated undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side.

"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio) statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offer and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from four different departments within four different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts, and Information Science in the School of Information. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high-dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and response for our pilot offering in 2015 with 153 applications for 20 positions and a yield rate of 80% from the offers we extended. We plan to build on the success of this initial offering in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2016-2018). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a no-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 30 undergraduates nationally and expose them to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by UM researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world.

"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems. The primary goal of these training  programs will be to help train a new generation of interdisciplinary neuroscientists with strong  quantitative skills.",INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE,9349475,R90DA023426,"['Appointment', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Minority Recruitment', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Neurosciences', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'bridge program', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'lectures', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'responsible research conduct', 'statistics', 'summer program', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R90,2017,305372,0.07816930715771138
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans.

"NextGen Random Forests Project Summary/Abstract Building from the PI's current R01, we propose next generation random forests (RF) designed for unprecedented accuracy and computational scalability to meet the challenges of today's complex and big data in the health sciences. Superior accuracy is achieved using super greedy trees which circumvent limitations on local adaptivity imposed by classical tree splitting. We identify a key quantity, forest weights, and show how these can be leveraged for further improvements and generalizability. In one application, improved survival estimators are applied to worldwide esophageal cancer data to develop guidelines for clinical decision making. Richer RF inference is another issue explored. Cutting edge machine learning methods rarely consider the problem of estimating variability. For RF, bootstrapping currently exists as the only tool for reliably estimating conﬁdence intervals, but due to heavy computations is rarely applied. We introduce tools to rapidily calculate standard errors based on U-statistic theory. These will be used to increase robustness of esophageal clinical recommendations and to investigate survival temporal trends in cardiovascular disease. In another application, we make use of our new massive data scalability for discovery of tumor and immune regulators of immunotherapy in cancers. This project will set the standard for RF computational performance. Building from the core libraries of the highly accessed R-package randomForestSRC (RF-SRC), software developed under the PIs current R01, we develop open source next generation RF software, RF-SRC Everywhere, Big Data RF-SRC, and HPC RF-SRC. The software will be deployable on a number of popular machine learning workbenches, use distributed data storage technologies, and be optimized for big-p, big-n, and big-np scenarios.

"The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to establish a national short course in Big Data Image Processing & Analysis (BigDIPA) intended to increase the number and overall skills of competent research scientists now encountering large, complex image data sources derived from cutting edge biological/biomedical research approaches. Extraction of knowledge from these imaging sources requires specialized skills and an interdisciplinary mindset. Yet effective training opportunities of this sector of the ""Big Data"" science community are glaringly underappreciated and underserved compared to other big data fields such as omics. UC Irvine is ideally suited to host a short course to address this thematic training deficit on account of the synergistic colocalization between multiple facilities, renowned for development of numerous advanced imaging techniques, and the outstanding instructional environment provided by faculty with collaborative expertise in biological image processing and computer vision, bioinformatics and high performance computational approaches.  Specifically, our BigDIPA proposal assembles an interdisciplinary alliance of faculty experts that can leverage the preeminent imaging resource facilities, such as the Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics (LFD) and the Beckman Laser Institute, and fuse these to ongoing campus big data initiatives, e.g. UCI's Data Science Initiative, to create a top-rated training course designed for senior graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, faculty and industry scientists from diverse scientific disciplines who have nascent interests and needs to handle BIG DATA sources beyond their current level of competency.  The course theme is focused to utilize discreet examples drawn from the analysis of complex data acquired from different microscopy imaging modalities employed to investigate dynamics in cellular and tissue processes, including signal transduction networks, development, neuroscience and biomedical applications, and that hereto where hidden or inaccessible to standard methods of analysis. Participants will be guided along the complete acquisition- processing-analysis pipeline through exposure to a coherent progression of topics and issues typically encountered when handling BIG DATA. We believe this training approach will therefore be attractive to a broad and significant untapped pool of researchers from the biological disciplines, biomedical engineering, systems biology, math, biophysics, computer science, bioinformatics and statistics who possess some, but not all, of the requisite competencies to effectively traverse the BD2K landscape. We have designed the course such that skills and experience gained by trainees will be transferable to their own research interests.  The BigDIPA course format will combine didactic lectures on the theory and foundational frameworks that underpin each step, with practical instruction on implementation and hands-on tutorials in image acquisition, large data handling, basic scripting of computational tools, image processing on high performance computing architectures, as well as feature extraction, evaluation and visualization of results. The course is designed to offer an intense learning experience delivered in a compact time frame, and opportunities to foster interdisciplinary interactions through small team exercises. Participants will also be encouraged to take advantage of pre-courses - separate and distinct training opportunities not funded by this proposal - that will be coordinated to directly precede our course. This unique format provides multiple benefits: it provides an efficient mechanism to address individual participant training deficiencies to permit a more productive experience in the BigDIPA course, adds no-cost mutual benefits to independent but synergistic programs, and facilitates recruitment of applicants who frequently feel interested but intimidated due to a perceived lack of prior adequate training.  Beyond providing an intensive on-site training course, all course materials (lecture notes, video lectures and tutorials), tutorial exercises, open source software resources and sample datasets will be made freely available through on-line distribution to maximize outreach and encourage additional contributions of curated training resources solicited from the community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to train and expand the cadre of researchers capable of effectively using the deluge of complex BIG DATA being generated by advanced biomedical imaging approaches. These data sources represent a rich source of complex information relevant to many scientific areas of inquiry, and are informative at multiple scales ranging from fundamental biological processes at the cellular level to patient diagnostics for diseases such as cancer or neurological disorders.",The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis,9295026,R25EB022366,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biophysics', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Fluorescence', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Stream', 'Systems Biology', 'Talents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'big biomedical data', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'biomedical scientist', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'course implementation', 'data acquisition', 'data format', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'learning materials', 'lecture notes', 'lectures', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'open source', 'outreach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'training opportunity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R25,2017,161997,0.08378301646036114

"ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, Imaging & Genomics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, Imaging and Genomics is an unprecedented global effort bringing together 287 scientists and all their vast biomedical datasets, to work on 9 major human brain diseases: schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, ADHD, OCD, autism, 22q deletion syndrome, HIV/AIDS and addictions. ENIGMA integrates images, genomes, connectomes and biomarkers on an unprecedented scale, with new kinds of computation for integration, clustering, and learning from complex biodata types. ENIGMA, founded in 2009, performed the largest brain imaging studies in history (N>26,000 subjects; Stein +207 authors, Nature Genetics, 2012) screening genomes and images at 125 institutions in 20 countries. Responding to the BD2K RFA, ENIGMA'S Working Groups target key programmatic goals of BD2K  funders across the NIH, including NIMH, NIBIB, NICHD, NIA, NINDS, NIDA, NIAAA, NHGRI and FIC. ENIGMA creates novel computational algorithms and a new model for Consortium Science to revolutionize the way Big Data is handled, shared and optimized. We unleash the power of sparse machine learning, and high dimensional combinatorics, to cluster and inter-relate genomes, connectomes, and multimodal brain images to discover diagnostic and prognostic markers. The sheer computational power and unprecedented collaboration advances distributed computation on Big Data leveraging US and non-US infrastructure, talents and data. Our projects will better identify factors that resist and promote brain disease, that help diagnosis and prognosis, and identify new mechanisms and drug targets. Our Data Science Research Cores create new algorithms to handle Big Data from (1) Imaging Genomics, (2) Connectomics, and (3) Machine Learning & Clinical Prediction. Led by world leaders in the field who developed major software packages (e.g., Jieping  Ye/SLEP), we prioritize trillions of computations for gene-image clustering, distributed multi-task machine  learning, and new approaches to screen brain connections based on the Partition Problem in mathematics.

"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization. Through lectures, hands-on training sessions and team projects, it will empower scientists from a variety of backgrounds in the use of these tools in research on the human brain and on neurological and psychiatric brain disorders.",Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science,9278954,R25MH112480,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Habits', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'career', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'design', 'e-science', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'lectures', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'project-based learning', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer institute', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2017,205185,0.07398405399969676
"QuBBD: Statistical & Visualization Methods for PGHD to Enable Precision Medicine  The purpose of this proposal is to develop a combination of innovative statistical and data visualization approaches using patient-generated health data, including mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable devices and smartphones, and patient-reported outcomes, to improve outcomes for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs). This research will offer new insights into how to process and transform patient-generated health data into precise lifestyle recommendations to help achieve remission of symptoms. The specific aims of this research are: 1) To develop new preprocessing methods for publicly available, heterogeneous, time-varied mHealth data to develop a high quality mHealth dataset; 2) To develop and apply novel machine learning methods to obtain accurate predictions and formal statistical inference for the influence of lifestyle features on disease activity in IBDs; and 3) To design and develop innovative, interactive data visualization tools for knowledge discovery. The methods developed in the areas of preprocessing of mHealth data, calibration for mHealth devices, machine learning, and interactive data visualization will be broadly applicable to other mHealth data, chronic conditions beyond IBDs, and other fields in which the data streams are highly variable, intermittent, and periodic. This work is highly relevant to the mission of the NIH BD2K initiative which supports the development of innovative and transformative approaches and tools to accelerate the integration of Big Data and data science into biomedical research. This project will also enhance training in the development and use of methods for biomedical Big Data science and mentor the next generation of multidisciplinary scientists. The proposed research is relevant to public health by seeking to improve symptoms for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, which are chronic, life-long conditions with waxing and waning symptoms. Developing novel statistical and visualization methods to provide a more nuanced understanding of the precise relationship between physical activity and sleep to disease activity is relevant to BD2K's mission.",QuBBD: Statistical & Visualization Methods for PGHD to Enable Precision Medicine ,9394127,R01EB025024,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Affect', 'Americas', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease remission', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Flare', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Health Care Research', 'Imagery', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Institute of Medicine (U.S.)', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Surveys', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Moderate Activity', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Sleep', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Stream', 'Symptoms', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Waxes', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'clinical remission', 'comparative effectiveness', 'cost', 'data visualization', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness research', 'health care quality', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large bowel Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'learning strategy', 'lifestyle factors', 'mHealth', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'symptomatic improvement', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,338637,0.024844244461148284
"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9310000,K01ES025442,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,144298,0.04319275949105305
"A Community Effort to Translate Protein Data to Knowledge: An Integrated Platform     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inception of the BD2K Initiative is a testament to the foresight of NIH and our community. Clearly, the future of biomedicine rests on our collective ability to transform Big Data into intelligible scientific facts. In line with the BD2K objectives,our goal is to revolutionize how we address the universal challenge to discern meaning from unruly data. Capitalizing on our investigators' complementary strengths in computational biology and cardiovascular medicine, we will present a fusion of cutting-edge innovations that are grounded in a cardiovascular research focus, encompassing: (i) on-the-cloud data processing, (ii) crowd sourcing and text-mining data annotation, (iii) protein spatiotemporal dynamics, (iv) multi-omic integration, and (v) multiscale clinical data modeling. Drawing from our decade of experience in creating and refining bioinformatics tools, we propose to amalgamate established Big Data resources into a generalizable model for data annotation and collaborative research, through a new query system and cloud infrastructure for accessing multiple omics repositories, and through computational-supported crowdsourcing initiatives for mining the biomedical literature. We propose to interweave diverse data types for revealing biological networks that coalesce from molecular entities at multiple scales, through machine learning methods for structuring molecular data and defining relationships with drugs and diseases, and through novel algorithms for on-the-cloud integration and pathway visualization of multi-dimensional molecular data. Moreover, we propose to innovate advanced modeling tools to resolve protein dynamics and spatiotemporal molecular mechanisms, through mechanistic modeling of protein properties and 3D protein expression maps, and through Bayesian algorithms that correlate patient phenotypes, health histories, and multi-scale molecular profiles. The utility and customizability o our tools to the broader research population is clearly demonstrated using three archetypical workflows that enable annotations of large lists of genes, transcripts, proteins, or metabolites; powerful analysis of complex protein datasets acquired over time; and seamless aQoregation of diverse molecular, textual and literature data. These workflows will be rigorously validated using data from two significant clinical cohorts, the Jackson Heart Study and the Healthy Elderly Longevity (Wellderly). In parallel, a multifaceted strategy will be implemented to educate and train biomedical investigators, and to engage the public for promoting the overall BD2K initiative. We are convinced that a community-driven BD2K initiative will best realize its scientific potential and transform the research culture in a sustainable manner, exhibiting lasting success beyond the current funding period.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The challenges of biomedical Big Data are multifaceted. Biomedical investigators face daunting tasks of storing, analyzing, and distributing large-scale omics data, and aggregating all information to discern mechanistic insights. A coherent effort is required to harness disarrayed Big Data and transform them into intelligible scientific facts, whil engaging the global community via education and outreach programs.

"Development of an Online Course Suite in Tools for Analysis of Sensor-Based Behavioral Health Data (AHA!) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This program focuses on the development and dissemination of online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health.

"Pilot for Creating Reproducible Workflows Using Docker Containers for NIH Commons DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds). The KnowEng environment will be deployed in a cloud infrastructure and fully available to the community, as will be the software developed by the Center. The proposed Center is a collaboration between the University of Illinois (UIUC), a recognized world leader in computational science and engineering, and the Mayo Clinic, one of the leading clinical care and research organizations in the world, and will be based at the UIUC Institute for Genomic Biology, which has state-of-the-art facilities and a nationally recognized program of multidisciplinary team-based genomic research.

"KnowEng, a Scalable Knowledge Engine for Large-Scale Genomic Data-OVERALL DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds). The KnowEng environment will be deployed in a cloud infrastructure and fully available to the community, as will be the software developed by the Center. The proposed Center is a collaboration between the University of Illinois (UIUC), a recognized world leader in computational science and engineering, and the Mayo Clinic, one of the leading clinical care and research organizations in the world, and will be based at the UIUC Institute for Genomic Biology, which has state-of-the-art facilities and a nationally recognized program of multidisciplinary team-based genomic research.

"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II Project Summary Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Clinical performance assessment emphasizes learner evaluation over learner development, lacks rigor and utility for developmental purposes, and clinical teachers have expressed particular difficulty with diagnosing reasoning deficits for remediation purposes. Further, medical students' diagnostic reasoning does not improve over the course of clinical training and senior medical students have highly variable diagnostic performance that is often rated below expectations according to theory-based and validated scoring criteria. Independent practice does not necessarily enhance the context for clinical reasoning; the majority of physicians' medical errors are thought to be diagnostic in nature. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Improve reliability of human scoring of DXJ essays. 2) Extend the automated scoring algorithms. 3) Automated reasoning failure categorization and remediation. 4) Complete the software development required for delivering the commercial product. 5) Evaluate predictive validity of automatically scored DXJ essays. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine. Project Narrative Today's clinical learning environments do not provide the level of deliberate practice, direct supervision, and rigorous assessment and feedback needed to develop diagnostic reasoning expertise. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.","Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition, Phase II",9339455,R42GM108104,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Case Based Learning', 'Case Study', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Competence', 'Community Health Education', 'Competence', 'Consult', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Education', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Incubators', 'Instruction', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Schedule', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Teaching Method', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Variant', 'base', 'educational atmosphere', 'essays', 'evidence base', 'expectation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical schools', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'software development', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'undergraduate medical education', 'undergraduate student', 'virtual']",NIGMS,"PARALLEL CONSULTING, LLC",R42,2017,500000,0.02826231884921514
"Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research Abstract: Researchers rely upon the lesion method to evaluate the speech-language status of stroke survivors and draw inferences about underlying brain function. This use of neuropsychology is highly valued in basic speech- language research because it can support causal inferences about brain structure/function relationships. Crucially, advances in analytic techniques and brain image computing are creating a new landscape for neuropsychological research. In this new landscape, the lesion method represents a form of big-data science that requires large sample sizes and complex image computing to implement lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) across the entire brain, without prior regions of interest. Expertise in these new techniques is becoming critical for high impact speech-language research. The career enhancement plan will provide the candidate with training in cutting-edge LSM. The candidate is an established speech-language investigator with a basic program of multidisciplinary research that includes populations with communication disorders due to stroke. The career enhancement will come at an ideal point, because it will build on the candidate's success in establishing an open-access research registry of stroke survivors (the Western Pennsylvania Patient Registry, WPPR), and current work to develop and validate collaborative videoconferencing for remote neuropsychological assessment. These efforts have created the recruitment pool and datasets that are needed for LSM. The career enhancement will provide the training needed to leverage these resources, thereby augmenting the candidate's program of research and career trajectory. The overarching objectives are to: (1) retool the skills of the candidate to infuse LSM into her program of speech-language research, (2) seed data sharing and data science partnerships to boost the candidate's leadership of WPPR as a national resource, and (3) advance understanding of LSM methods and the neural substrates for speech and language to improve the knowledge base of the candidate and other investigators. The candidate proposes a synergistic set of activities. Didactic activities will give training in machie learning and brain image computing, scholarly travel experiences will afford opportunities to network with speech-language researchers and data scientists whose work is relevant for LSM, and two research studies will provide a hands-on opportunity for the candidate to acquire, apply, and extend LSM methods under the guidance of a superb mentoring team. Study 1 will use univariate and multivariate LSM analysis to investigate the neural substrates of chronic Broca's aphasia and the factors that influence the reproducibility of LSM results. Study 2 will develop and evaluate a workflow for automated lesion segmentation, using a software platform (3D Slicer) that involves two NIH-supported data science centers. Overall, the career enhancement will retool the skills, research network, and knowledge base of an established investigator, allowing the candidate to significantly augment her program of speech-language research and advance the utility of WPPR as a national resource for speech-language research.

"Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     A new electrical biomarker has been identified in high resolution, intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings, called a high frequency oscillation (HFO). Studies have suggested this biomarker has great promise to identify seizure networks and improve surgical outcomes for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, translation of HFOs to clinical practice is hampered by many factors such as spatial, temporal and inter-patient variation in HFO detection rates, false positive and false negative detections, and significant background noise. Big data approaches using large numbers of HFOs acquired from many patients are needed to quantify these effects and allow clinical usage of HFOs. This project details a plan in which the candidate's experience quantifying measurement and detection bias in massive high energy nuclear physics datasets will be combined with a multidisciplinary mentor team to address this problem. The combination of training in computational neuroscience, big data network analysis, and translational neural engineering research will be critical to approach this problem and provide a career trajectory for the candidate. The specific aims of this proposal address three specific confounding factors: 1) the false negative HFO detection rate, 2) variations in HFO features not due to epilepsy, and 3) effects of the state of vigilance on HFOs. Each of these aims involve novel big data methods and/or applications generalizable to other situations: 1) estimating false positive detection rates using a combined experimental/simulated data approach, 2) clustering and classification of distributions of data points, rather than of the data points directly, and 3) a general disambiguation statistic to assess meaningful (rather than statistical) difference between distributions.  The applicant's career goal is to become an academic researcher in the analysis and modeling of intracranial EEG data with a focus on translational epilepsy and sleep physiology research. With the rapid advancement in the resolution of clinical EEG, there is already a strong need for this type of research expertise. Thi grant will provide didactic coursework, formal research and methods training, and career guidance from an expert mentor team. The three mentors have appointments spanning Neurology, Anesthesiology, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The candidate will also build and mentor a research team and establish external collaborations.  The University of Michigan is a premier research university with strong programs and training opportunities in biomedical and physical sciences, engineering, translational and academic research, and advanced research computing. This proposal makes extensive use of the University's large computer cluster. The mentor team and an external collaborator will provide candidate access to prerecorded, deidentified data from over 150 patients, estimated to have over 40 million HFOs. The environment and mentor team will provide the training, facilities, and data for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Recent advances in epilepsy research are generating very large datasets in the search for better ways to identify the region of brain responsible for generating seizures. A particular signa known as High Frequency Oscillations found in high resolution intracranial EEG shows great promise for identifying these regions, but clinicians are unable to use the signal due to confounding biases. This project combines big data processing expertise from particle physics, computer science and machine learning to address these confounds, providing a more accurate process to enable clinical translation of this new biomarker and potentially improve clinical outcomes.",Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy,9322204,K01ES026839,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesiology', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hybrids', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manpower and Training', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Energy', 'Nuclear Physics', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer cluster', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'particle physics', 'patient population', 'physical science', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'signal processing', 'spatial temporal variation', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'vigilance']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2017,148964,-0.04354084382515068
"LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The overall goal of the Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program (PREP) in Biomedical Sciences (BMS) at the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans (LSUHSC-NO) is to enhance the diversity of the research workforce by increasing competitiveness for acceptance and completion of PhD and MD/PhD programs by underrepresented minorities (URM). LSUHSC-NO PREP will accept 39 recent URM baccalaureate science graduates over 5 yrs for intensive research and innovative academic training experi- ences to foster success in BMS doctoral degree programs. Over 300 URM science baccalaureates are award- ed annually to URM students by universities located within 100 miles of LSUHSC-NO representing 32% of all science degrees; however, URM constitute only 10% of enrolled PhD and MD/PhD students nationwide, and 12% at LSUHSC-NO. The PREP will enhance competitiveness for acceptance, retention, and completion of BMS PhD programs by the Scholars by providing 1) intensive research experiences with committed research faculty, and 2) complementary skills development during the 1-yr training. PREP training will focus on building solid foundations in research skills by providing concentrated education in scientific critical thinking, analysis of results, statistics, and writing; inventive and personalized test-taking skills to improve GRE scores and success in graduate courses; oral and poster scientific presentations; responsible and ethical conduct in research; and writing a resume, personal statement, and selecting and applying to graduate schools. Scholars will participate in works-in-progress, journal clubs, and workshops hosted by PREP faculty, visitors, and recruitment contacts; join graduate students in skills development programs; present their research at the annual PREP poster sym- posium and local and national scientific conferences; mentor summer research fellows; and assist in communi- ty science education programs. The PREP will provide forums for the Scholars to engage in research and skills acquisition and active demonstration of knowledge. Over 60 LSUHSC-NO active research faculty, committed to the PREP, have extensive experience in mentoring high school, undergraduate, medical, predoctoral, and postdoctoral students representing URM in the BMS through NIH T32, R25, R35, and other funding mecha- nisms. There are 8 active LSUHSC-NO summer programs which provide research experiences to 75 URM fel- lows annually from which future PREP Scholars will be prescreened and recruited. Scholar recruitment efforts will extend to 4 local historically black colleges and 2 state universities to develop a community-wide mecha- nism to support the URM BMS workforce. The program will be critically evaluated using formative and summa- tive methodologies and descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative statistics to document success. The overall goal is for PREP Scholars to have an enhanced competitiveness for acceptance into rigorous graduate pro- grams with the confidence and essential research skills required to earn a PhD or MD/PhD degree, establish rewarding and successful BMS research careers, and serve as role-models for future URM students. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the LSUHSC-NO PREP is to prepare individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in the biomedical sciences, who have recently completed their baccalaureate science degrees, for successful enrollment, retention, and completion of a PhD or MD-PhD training program. We aim to enhance the diversity of the biomedical research workforce by preparing PREP Scholars for the rigors and challenges of a biomedical doctoral degree program so that they will successfully obtain a PhD degree or MD/PhD degree and contribute their expertise to the biomedical scientific community.",LSUHSC-New Orleans Postbaccalaureate Research Education Program in Biomedical Sciences,9208463,R25GM121189,"['Academic Training', 'Anxiety', 'Award', 'Bachelor&apos', 's Degree', 'Basic Science', 'Biomedical Research', 'Centers of Research Excellence', 'Cities', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Critical Thinking', 'Data Analyses', 'Degree program', 'Dentistry', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Extramural Activities', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Sciences', 'Historically Black Colleges and Universities', 'Individual', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratory Research', 'Learning', 'Louisiana', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minority Enrollment', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Oral', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Solid', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Study Skills', 'Sum', 'Technical Expertise', 'Testing', 'Time Management', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'Writing', 'career', 'design', 'doctoral student', 'education research', 'experience', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'gulf coast', 'high school', 'improved', 'innovation', 'invention', 'medical schools', 'member', 'minority communities', 'novel', 'posters', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'role model', 'science education', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'skills training', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer program', 'summer research', 'symposium', 'undergraduate student', 'underrepresented minority student', 'university student']",NIGMS,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R25,2017,255172,0.08436980756972783
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9333122,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'online resource', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool', 'visiting scholar']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2017,401742,0.05806508921011966
"Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    My goal in seeking a K01 Award is to acquire the necessary training to become an independently funded investigator focused on exploiting the power of biomedical Big Data Science to improve outcome following severe injury. I am a trauma surgeon at San Francisco General Hospital, one of the Nation's leading trauma centers, and an Assistant Professor of Surgery at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). UCSF has recently entered into collaboration with the National Laboratories to study the use of biomedical Big Data in complex clinical conditions and my main mentor, Dr. Mitchell J. Cohen is the lead investigator at UCSF for this collaboration. I believe that given the complexity of the factors that likely affect traum outcome including patient injury patterns, medical co-morbidities, patient biology, and the system of care, trauma provides a solid foundation to study the utility of Big Data Science for solving complex medical questions. To facilitate my growth as an expert in this field, I am proposing to develop a framework for integrating multiple data sources necessary to forecast patient outcomes following trauma. These novel datasets combined with biologic and metadata will then be utilized to create improved metrics that better predict complication risk from modifiable and non-modifiable factors. The net result of this work is a new approach to data ascertainment for measuring outcome, leveraging new data types to improve prediction of patient trajectory, and creating a platform to interface with existing information technology to ultimately be used for an early warning detection system for patients at risk of complications. The future long-term goal of this work would be to identify early patients predicted to do more poorly and then apply refinements to the process of care to minimize complication development. The creation of early warning detection systems has significant theoretic potential to improve quality and ultimately decrease costs. Nearly $30 billion per year in the US is spent on care for the traumatically injured and the development of post-traumatic complications is believed to be major contributor to the overall costs of care. The ability to report performance has been hampered by a lack of standard definitions, reporting bias, access to datasets, and the analysis techniques that fail to account for the highly confounded relationships contributing to patient outcome. This K01 award will provide me with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in applying biologic big data to trauma care (2) to elucidate the relationship of modifiable factors affecting complication development (3) to gain experience with advanced biostatistical techniques and bioinformatics; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary team including Dr. Cohen, a National expert in trauma systems biology and biologic big data, and two co-mentors: Dr. Michael Matthay, a translational research expert in complications after severe illness, and Dr. Alan Hubbard, an expert in advanced biostatistical techniques including biologic big data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    In the US, trauma is the leading cause of death for those under 45 years old and many of the patients who survive their initial injuries develop complications such as blood clots or pneumonia that contribute to both death and the long-term effects of the trauma. Through leveraging the power of biomedical Big Data, an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing integrated EMR early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early with the intent to ultimately refie the process of care for this group to minimize complication development.",Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data,9320947,K01ES026834,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood coagulation', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Deltastab', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'care systems', 'career', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'demographics', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'injured', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'portability', 'prediction algorithm', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2017,221780,0.049500250646782276
"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9369218,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2017,170466,0.03378444405133302
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9270644,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2017,313812,0.07571843775200461

"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,9253392,P30ES006096,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Allergic Disease', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Integrative Medicine', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Nature', 'Neurology', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Power Plants', 'Predisposition', 'Program Development', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Education', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Series', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'environmental agent', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'human capital', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lipid disorder', 'malignant endocrine gland neoplasm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'symposium', 'translation to humans']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2017,1728654,0.04612544999097422

"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery. PROJECT NARRATIVE Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture, and affects over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) is a class of gene that has largely been understudied, and recent studies suggested their potential roles in autoimmune diseases.

"Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract The value of mannequin-based simulation is well recognized and is incorporated extensively into medical education. In general, their primary purpose is to simulate a physical ""patient"" on which to learn, demonstrate, and test skill without fear of harming patients prior to entering clinical environments. Despite their substantial benefits, they have several fundamental limitations. Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of both existing physical mannequin-based training and virtual media to support clinical learning using Augmented Reality (AR). This Phase I project will focus on creating and evaluating a proof of concept system. An engaging, interactive training course using the prototype system will be developed as a case study for clinical nursing training on pressure injuries – an oftentimes preventable injury that is attributed to tremendous human suffering and represents a significant cost burden on our health care system. The course will leverage existing mannequin-based training used at the UMN and be evaluated by both instructors and students at the School of Nursing. Project Narrative Over the past decade, medical simulation has been experiencing explosive growth and widespread adoption. There are now over 800 medical simulation centers in the US alone, located in medical schools, nursing schools, hospitals, military simulation centers, and schools of allied health professions. The global market for Mannequin-Based Simulation is projected to reach $1 Billion by 2020. It is hypothesized that the combination of existing physical mannequin-based training with virtual media will opens new possibilities for exploration and enhanced learning interactions for medical education.",Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults,9409513,R43AG057257,"['Adoption', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Allied Health Profession', 'Anatomy', 'Augmented Reality', 'Caregivers', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Nursing', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Fright', 'Growth', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Manikins', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Military Personnel', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nursing Schools', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Sampling', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Skin', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Support Groups', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'animation', 'base', 'caregiver education', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human study', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'medical schools', 'pressure', 'professor', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'skills', 'teacher', 'virtual', 'virtual reality']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R43,2017,224952,0.009877980681980003
"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,9021663,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'exercise program', 'faculty research', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'personalized approach', 'programs', 'quantitative imaging', 'student training', 'teaching assistant', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2016,59383,0.03831810594147258
"Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology The  Training  Program  in  Computational  Neuroscience  (TPCN)  will  support  integrated   undergraduate  and graduate training in computational neuroscience at New York University. The program will be hosted  by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of  Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of  Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is  one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a  Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has  hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS  established an undergraduate major in  neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now  has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and  the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the  neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As  NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS   and  the  School  of  Medicine),  this training grant will ensure that computational modeling,  which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate  program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to  Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with  these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques  for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed  training  program will support coherent undergraduate  and  graduate  training  in   computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship  methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human  factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers.  (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed  specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose  innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit  modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees  for jobs not only in academia, but  also  in  medical  and  industry research. To achieve this, we  will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational  neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have  complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in  mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry.  Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side. This grant will support training of a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in  computational neuroscience, which has become increasingly important to meet the challenges of  making discoveries with new data analysis tools and of understanding highly nonlinear complex  neural circuits. A salient component of our program is training in the nascent field  of   Computational  Psychiatry,  bridging  basic  neuroscience  and clinical research on mental  disorders. Therefore, the proposed program has the potential of making  a significant impact on  mental health.",Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology,9316750,R90DA043849,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Faculty', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Occupations', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Side', 'Students', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'cognitive function', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'design', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'neural circuit', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'undergraduate education']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R90,2016,204981,0.05101702304936782

"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems. The primary goal of these training  programs will be to help train a new generation of interdisciplinary neuroscientists with strong  quantitative skills.",INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE,9322706,R90DA023426,"['Appointment', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Camping', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Minority Recruitment', 'Modeling', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Neurosciences', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'bridge program', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'lectures', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'responsible research conduct', 'statistics', 'summer program', 'tool']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R90,2016,316840,0.07816930715771138
"Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data DESCRIPTION:  Funding is sought for the Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data (SISBID) at the University of Washington. This program will provide workshops on the statistical and computational skills needed to access, process, manage, and analyze large biomedical data sets. It will be co-directed by Ali Shojaie and Daniela Witten, faculty in the Department of Biostatistics at University of Washington.  The SISBID program will consist of five 2.5-day in-person courses, or modules, taught at the University of Washington each July. An individual participant can register for whichever set of modules he or she chooses. The five modules are as follows: (1) Accessing Biomedical Big Data; (2) Data Visualization; (3) Supervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (4) Unsupervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (5) Reproducible Research for Biomedical Big Data. Each module will consist of a combination of formal lectures and hands-on computing labs. Participants will work together in teams in order to apply the skills that they develop in each module to important problems drawn from relevant case studies.  The primary audience for SISBID will consist of biomedical scientists who would like to develop the statistical and computational training needed to make use of Biomedical Big Data. The secondary audience will consist of individuals with stronger statistical or computational backgrounds but little exposure to biology, who will learn how to apply their skills to problems associated with Biomedical Big Data. Participants will include advanced undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and researchers, and will be drawn from industry, government, and academia. In order to ensure that all participants are able to fully engage in the program, participants will be expected to already have some prior background in R programming and statistical inference, which can be obtained by taking two free online courses before the program begins.  Each of the five modules will be co-taught by two instructors. The ten instructors will be drawn from top universities and research centers across the U.S., such as the University of Washington, Rice University, University of Iowa, Johns Hopkins University, MD Anderson Cancer Research Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and University of North Carolina. They have been selected based on research expertise and excellence in teaching.  Lecture videos and slides will be made freely available online so that individuals who are unable to attend SISBID in person can still benefit from the program.  This proposal specifically requests funds for 55 student / postdoctoral fellow travel scholarships per year, 130 student / postdoctoral fellow registration scholarships per year, instructor travel and stipends, teaching assistant stipends, and PI salary support. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   In recent years, the biomedical sciences have been inundated by Big Data, such as DNA sequence data and electronic medical records. In principle, it should be possible to use such data for a variety of tasks, such as predicting an individual's risk of developing diabetes or cancer, and tailoring therapies to an individual should he or she become ill. The Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data will provide biomedical researchers with the computational and statistical training needed in order to take advantage of Big Data, so that they can more effectively use it to understand human diseases and to improve human health.",Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data,9063061,R25EB020380,"['Academia', 'Applied Skills', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Center', 'Case Study', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Government', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'North Carolina', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rice', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Slide', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Wages', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomedical scientist', 'data visualization', 'graduate student', 'human disease', 'improved', 'instructor', 'learning materials', 'lectures', 'massive open online courses', 'member', 'online course', 'open source', 'programs', 'skills', 'statistics', 'summer institute', 'teacher', 'teaching assistant', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2016,159605,0.0798839456277759
"The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to establish a national short course in Big Data Image Processing & Analysis (BigDIPA) intended to increase the number and overall skills of competent research scientists now encountering large, complex image data sources derived from cutting edge biological/biomedical research approaches. Extraction of knowledge from these imaging sources requires specialized skills and an interdisciplinary mindset. Yet effective training opportunities of this sector of the ""Big Data"" science community are glaringly underappreciated and underserved compared to other big data fields such as omics. UC Irvine is ideally suited to host a short course to address this thematic training deficit on account of the synergistic colocalization between multiple facilities, renowned for development of numerous advanced imaging techniques, and the outstanding instructional environment provided by faculty with collaborative expertise in biological image processing and computer vision, bioinformatics and high performance computational approaches.  Specifically, our BigDIPA proposal assembles an interdisciplinary alliance of faculty experts that can leverage the preeminent imaging resource facilities, such as the Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics (LFD) and the Beckman Laser Institute, and fuse these to ongoing campus big data initiatives, e.g. UCI's Data Science Initiative, to create a top-rated training course designed for senior graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, faculty and industry scientists from diverse scientific disciplines who have nascent interests and needs to handle BIG DATA sources beyond their current level of competency.  The course theme is focused to utilize discreet examples drawn from the analysis of complex data acquired from different microscopy imaging modalities employed to investigate dynamics in cellular and tissue processes, including signal transduction networks, development, neuroscience and biomedical applications, and that hereto where hidden or inaccessible to standard methods of analysis. Participants will be guided along the complete acquisition- processing-analysis pipeline through exposure to a coherent progression of topics and issues typically encountered when handling BIG DATA. We believe this training approach will therefore be attractive to a broad and significant untapped pool of researchers from the biological disciplines, biomedical engineering, systems biology, math, biophysics, computer science, bioinformatics and statistics who possess some, but not all, of the requisite competencies to effectively traverse the BD2K landscape. We have designed the course such that skills and experience gained by trainees will be transferable to their own research interests.  The BigDIPA course format will combine didactic lectures on the theory and foundational frameworks that underpin each step, with practical instruction on implementation and hands-on tutorials in image acquisition, large data handling, basic scripting of computational tools, image processing on high performance computing architectures, as well as feature extraction, evaluation and visualization of results. The course is designed to offer an intense learning experience delivered in a compact time frame, and opportunities to foster interdisciplinary interactions through small team exercises. Participants will also be encouraged to take advantage of pre-courses - separate and distinct training opportunities not funded by this proposal - that will be coordinated to directly precede our course. This unique format provides multiple benefits: it provides an efficient mechanism to address individual participant training deficiencies to permit a more productive experience in the BigDIPA course, adds no-cost mutual benefits to independent but synergistic programs, and facilitates recruitment of applicants who frequently feel interested but intimidated due to a perceived lack of prior adequate training.  Beyond providing an intensive on-site training course, all course materials (lecture notes, video lectures and tutorials), tutorial exercises, open source software resources and sample datasets will be made freely available through on-line distribution to maximize outreach and encourage additional contributions of curated training resources solicited from the community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to train and expand the cadre of researchers capable of effectively using the deluge of complex BIG DATA being generated by advanced biomedical imaging approaches. These data sources represent a rich source of complex information relevant to many scientific areas of inquiry, and are informative at multiple scales ranging from fundamental biological processes at the cellular level to patient diagnostics for diseases such as cancer or neurological disorders.",The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis,9150564,R25EB022366,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Fluorescence', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skills Development', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Systems Biology', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'biomedical scientist', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'course implementation', 'data acquisition', 'data format', 'demographics', 'design', 'education research', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'learning materials', 'lecture notes', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'microscopic imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'open source', 'outreach', 'programs', 'repository', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tissue processing', 'training opportunity']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R25,2016,161997,0.08378301646036114

"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,9099840,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Applied Skills', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'emotion regulation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'reward anticipation', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,144298,0.04319275949105305
"KnowEng, a Scalable Knowledge Engine for Large-Scale Genomic Data-OVERALL     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds). The KnowEng environment will be deployed in a cloud infrastructure and fully available to the community, as will be the software developed by the Center.

"KnowEng, a Scalable Knowledge Engine for Large-Scale Genomic Data-OVERALL     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds). The KnowEng environment will be deployed in a cloud infrastructure and fully available to the community, as will be the software developed by the Center.

"A Community Effort to Translate Protein Data to Knowledge: An Integrated Platform     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inception of the BD2K Initiative is a testament to the foresight of NIH and our community. Clearly, the future of biomedicine rests on our collective ability to transform Big Data into intelligible scientific facts. In line with the BD2K objectives,our goal is to revolutionize how we address the universal challenge to discern meaning from unruly data. Capitalizing on our investigators' complementary strengths in computational biology and cardiovascular medicine, we will present a fusion of cutting-edge innovations that are grounded in a cardiovascular research focus, encompassing: (i) on-the-cloud data processing, (ii) crowd sourcing and text-mining data annotation, (iii) protein spatiotemporal dynamics, (iv) multi-omic integration, and (v) multiscale clinical data modeling. Drawing from our decade of experience in creating and refining bioinformatics tools, we propose to amalgamate established Big Data resources into a generalizable model for data annotation and collaborative research, through a new query system and cloud infrastructure for accessing multiple omics repositories, and through computational-supported crowdsourcing initiatives for mining the biomedical literature. We propose to interweave diverse data types for revealing biological networks that coalesce from molecular entities at multiple scales, through machine learning methods for structuring molecular data and defining relationships with drugs and diseases, and through novel algorithms for on-the-cloud integration and pathway visualization of multi-dimensional molecular data. Moreover, we propose to innovate advanced modeling tools to resolve protein dynamics and spatiotemporal molecular mechanisms, through mechanistic modeling of protein properties and 3D protein expression maps, and through Bayesian algorithms that correlate patient phenotypes, health histories, and multi-scale molecular profiles. The utility and customizability o our tools to the broader research population is clearly demonstrated using three archetypical workflows that enable annotations of large lists of genes, transcripts, proteins, or metabolites; powerful analysis of complex protein datasets acquired over time; and seamless aQoregation of diverse molecular, textual and literature data. These workflows will be rigorously validated using data from two significant clinical cohorts, the Jackson Heart Study and the Healthy Elderly Longevity (Wellderly). In parallel, a multifaceted strategy will be implemented to educate and train biomedical investigators, and to engage the public for promoting the overall BD2K initiative. We are convinced that a community-driven BD2K initiative will best realize its scientific potential and transform the research culture in a sustainable manner, exhibiting lasting success beyond the current funding period.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The challenges of biomedical Big Data are multifaceted. Biomedical investigators face daunting tasks of storing, analyzing, and distributing large-scale omics data, and aggregating all information to discern mechanistic insights. A coherent effort is required to harness disarrayed Big Data and transform them into intelligible scientific facts, whil engaging the global community via education and outreach programs. This Big Data Science Research proposal is designed to address these challenges by formulating a federated architecture of community-supported tools for enhancing data management, integration and analysis.            ",A Community Effort to Translate Protein Data to Knowledge: An Integrated Platform,9087292,U54GM114833,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Face', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Harvest', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medicine', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Organ', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Population Research', 'Property', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Proteins', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training and Education', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'big biomedical data', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'crowdsourcing', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'data to knowledge', 'design', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'operation', 'outreach program', 'protein complex', 'protein expression', 'protein metabolite', 'protein protein interaction', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'support tools', 'text searching', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U54,2016,133604,-0.01472956419162583

"Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Training in lesion-symptom mapping for speech-language research Abstract: Researchers rely upon the lesion method to evaluate the speech-language status of stroke survivors and draw inferences about underlying brain function. This use of neuropsychology is highly valued in basic speech- language research because it can support causal inferences about brain structure/function relationships. Crucially, advances in analytic techniques and brain image computing are creating a new landscape for neuropsychological research. In this new landscape, the lesion method represents a form of big-data science that requires large sample sizes and complex image computing to implement lesion-symptom mapping (LSM) across the entire brain, without prior regions of interest. Expertise in these new techniques is becoming critical for high impact speech-language research. The career enhancement plan will provide the candidate with training in cutting-edge LSM. The candidate is an established speech-language investigator with a basic program of multidisciplinary research that includes populations with communication disorders due to stroke. The career enhancement will come at an ideal point, because it will build on the candidate's success in establishing an open-access research registry of stroke survivors (the Western Pennsylvania Patient Registry, WPPR), and current work to develop and validate collaborative videoconferencing for remote neuropsychological assessment. These efforts have created the recruitment pool and datasets that are needed for LSM. The career enhancement will provide the training needed to leverage these resources, thereby augmenting the candidate's program of research and career trajectory. The overarching objectives are to: (1) retool the skills of the candidate to infuse LSM into her program of speech-language research, (2) seed data sharing and data science partnerships to boost the candidate's leadership of WPPR as a national resource, and (3) advance understanding of LSM methods and the neural substrates for speech and language to improve the knowledge base of the candidate and other investigators. The candidate proposes a synergistic set of activities. Didactic activities will give training in machie learning and brain image computing, scholarly travel experiences will afford opportunities to network with speech-language researchers and data scientists whose work is relevant for LSM, and two research studies will provide a hands-on opportunity for the candidate to acquire, apply, and extend LSM methods under the guidance of a superb mentoring team. Study 1 will use univariate and multivariate LSM analysis to investigate the neural substrates of chronic Broca's aphasia and the factors that influence the reproducibility of LSM results. Study 2 will develop and evaluate a workflow for automated lesion segmentation, using a software platform (3D Slicer) that involves two NIH-supported data science centers. Overall, the career enhancement will retool the skills, research network, and knowledge base of an established investigator, allowing the candidate to significantly augment her program of speech-language research and advance the utility of WPPR as a national resource for speech-language research.

"Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     A new electrical biomarker has been identified in high resolution, intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings, called a high frequency oscillation (HFO). Studies have suggested this biomarker has great promise to identify seizure networks and improve surgical outcomes for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, translation of HFOs to clinical practice is hampered by many factors such as spatial, temporal and inter-patient variation in HFO detection rates, false positive and false negative detections, and significant background noise. Big data approaches using large numbers of HFOs acquired from many patients are needed to quantify these effects and allow clinical usage of HFOs. This project details a plan in which the candidate's experience quantifying measurement and detection bias in massive high energy nuclear physics datasets will be combined with a multidisciplinary mentor team to address this problem. The combination of training in computational neuroscience, big data network analysis, and translational neural engineering research will be critical to approach this problem and provide a career trajectory for the candidate. The specific aims of this proposal address three specific confounding factors: 1) the false negative HFO detection rate, 2) variations in HFO features not due to epilepsy, and 3) effects of the state of vigilance on HFOs. Each of these aims involve novel big data methods and/or applications generalizable to other situations: 1) estimating false positive detection rates using a combined experimental/simulated data approach, 2) clustering and classification of distributions of data points, rather than of the data points directly, and 3) a general disambiguation statistic to assess meaningful (rather than statistical) difference between distributions.  The applicant's career goal is to become an academic researcher in the analysis and modeling of intracranial EEG data with a focus on translational epilepsy and sleep physiology research. With the rapid advancement in the resolution of clinical EEG, there is already a strong need for this type of research expertise. Thi grant will provide didactic coursework, formal research and methods training, and career guidance from an expert mentor team. The three mentors have appointments spanning Neurology, Anesthesiology, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The candidate will also build and mentor a research team and establish external collaborations.  The University of Michigan is a premier research university with strong programs and training opportunities in biomedical and physical sciences, engineering, translational and academic research, and advanced research computing. This proposal makes extensive use of the University's large computer cluster. The mentor team and an external collaborator will provide candidate access to prerecorded, deidentified data from over 150 patients, estimated to have over 40 million HFOs. The environment and mentor team will provide the training, facilities, and data for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed goals. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Recent advances in epilepsy research are generating very large datasets in the search for better ways to identify the region of brain responsible for generating seizures. A particular signa known as High Frequency Oscillations found in high resolution intracranial EEG shows great promise for identifying these regions, but clinicians are unable to use the signal due to confounding biases. This project combines big data processing expertise from particle physics, computer science and machine learning to address these confounds, providing a more accurate process to enable clinical translation of this new biomarker and potentially improve clinical outcomes.",Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy,9147594,K01ES026839,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesiology', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manpower and Training', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Physics', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vocational Guidance', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer cluster', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'particle physics', 'patient population', 'physical science', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'signal processing', 'sleep epilepsy', 'spatial temporal variation', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'training opportunity', 'vigilance']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2016,148644,-0.04354084382515068
"Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    My goal in seeking a K01 Award is to acquire the necessary training to become an independently funded investigator focused on exploiting the power of biomedical Big Data Science to improve outcome following severe injury. I am a trauma surgeon at San Francisco General Hospital, one of the Nation's leading trauma centers, and an Assistant Professor of Surgery at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). UCSF has recently entered into collaboration with the National Laboratories to study the use of biomedical Big Data in complex clinical conditions and my main mentor, Dr. Mitchell J. Cohen is the lead investigator at UCSF for this collaboration. I believe that given the complexity of the factors that likely affect traum outcome including patient injury patterns, medical co-morbidities, patient biology, and the system of care, trauma provides a solid foundation to study the utility of Big Data Science for solving complex medical questions. To facilitate my growth as an expert in this field, I am proposing to develop a framework for integrating multiple data sources necessary to forecast patient outcomes following trauma. These novel datasets combined with biologic and metadata will then be utilized to create improved metrics that better predict complication risk from modifiable and non-modifiable factors. The net result of this work is a new approach to data ascertainment for measuring outcome, leveraging new data types to improve prediction of patient trajectory, and creating a platform to interface with existing information technology to ultimately be used for an early warning detection system for patients at risk of complications. The future long-term goal of this work would be to identify early patients predicted to do more poorly and then apply refinements to the process of care to minimize complication development. The creation of early warning detection systems has significant theoretic potential to improve quality and ultimately decrease costs. Nearly $30 billion per year in the US is spent on care for the traumatically injured and the development of post-traumatic complications is believed to be major contributor to the overall costs of care. The ability to report performance has been hampered by a lack of standard definitions, reporting bias, access to datasets, and the analysis techniques that fail to account for the highly confounded relationships contributing to patient outcome. This K01 award will provide me with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in applying biologic big data to trauma care (2) to elucidate the relationship of modifiable factors affecting complication development (3) to gain experience with advanced biostatistical techniques and bioinformatics; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary team including Dr. Cohen, a National expert in trauma systems biology and biologic big data, and two co-mentors: Dr. Michael Matthay, a translational research expert in complications after severe illness, and Dr. Alan Hubbard, an expert in advanced biostatistical techniques including biologic big data analysis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    In the US, trauma is the leading cause of death for those under 45 years old and many of the patients who survive their initial injuries develop complications such as blood clots or pneumonia that contribute to both death and the long-term effects of the trauma. Through leveraging the power of biomedical Big Data, an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing integrated EMR early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early with the intent to ultimately refie the process of care for this group to minimize complication development.",Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data,9147595,K01ES026834,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood coagulation', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Aging', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'care systems', 'career', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'injured', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'professor', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2016,222942,0.049500250646782276
"Big Data education for the masses: MOOCs, modules, & intelligent tutoring systems DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Biomedical science, higher education, software and technology are simultaneously undergoing tectonic shifts. The amazing pace of software and technological development are driving equally amazing advances in the ability to acquire massive data sets in the biomedical sciences. These new Big Biomedical data sets come in the form of complex measurements, such as that of the brain, genome, proteome and human biome or massive databases, such as with electronic health records. Big Data issues, such as reproducibility of processing, measurement and analysis techniques, are increasingly complex, and crucial. Across all domains there is a knowledge gap of researchers to analyze and interpret these new data sets and the current higher education model cannot meet the insatiable demand for this training. We propose to make substantial progress on these issues in two domains. Specifically, we propose to use Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to create two series, one in neuroimaging and one in genomics. These series will allow for flexible, student paced, low cost scalable training for tens of thousands of students. Along with these series, we propose the creation of modular Big Data biostatistical content that can be used by students as well as teachers. This effort will be parallel to work on an intelligent tutoring syste called swirl. This application proposes to use swirl to create rich, gamified learning environments for students. All of the material created from this grant will be open access and free. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Project narrative: We propose two Massive Open Online Course series in neuroimaging and genomic Big Data analysis as well as the creation of modular Big Data statistics content and content creation for an intelligent tutoring system.","Big Data education for the masses: MOOCs, modules, & intelligent tutoring systems",9061684,R25EB020378,"['Adopted', 'Amaze', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Models', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Medicine', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Sets', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Nurses', 'Public Health Nursing', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stream', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'big biomedical data', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'course module', 'density', 'educational atmosphere', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'higher education', 'instructor', 'learning materials', 'lectures', 'massive open online courses', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'process repeatability', 'programs', 'research study', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'tutoring']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R25,2016,209444,0.07334903877247785
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9128789,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Organ failure', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career development', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'early-career faculty', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'leadership development', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'predict clinical outcome', 'program dissemination', 'programs', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'student training', 'success', 'translational medicine']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2016,423432,0.07571843775200461
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,9103879,U54EB020405,"['Accelerometer', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Mental Depression', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'big biomedical data', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'massive open online courses', 'models and simulation', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'reduce symptoms', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool', 'visiting scholar']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2016,401742,0.05806508921011966
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,9044557,P30ES006096,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Allergic Disease', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health education', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Integrative Medicine', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Nature', 'Neurology', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Power Plants', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'environmental agent', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'health science research', 'high risk', 'human capital', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lipid disorder', 'malignant endocrine gland neoplasm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'symposium']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2016,1729509,0.04612544999097422
"The q-bio Summer School DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems.

"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential.

"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio) statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offer and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from four different departments within four different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts, and Information Science in the School of Information. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high-dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and response for our pilot offering in 2015 with 153 applications for 20 positions and a yield rate of 80% from the offers we extended. We plan to build on the success of this initial offering in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2016-2018). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a no-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 30 undergraduates nationally and expose them to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by UM researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose a six week long summer institute: ""Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data"" to be held at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, with a group of approximately 30 undergraduates recruited nationally, from 2016-2018.

"Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data DESCRIPTION:  Funding is sought for the Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data (SISBID) at the University of Washington. This program will provide workshops on the statistical and computational skills needed to access, process, manage, and analyze large biomedical data sets. It will be co-directed by Ali Shojaie and Daniela Witten, faculty in the Department of Biostatistics at University of Washington.  The SISBID program will consist of five 2.5-day in-person courses, or modules, taught at the University of Washington each July. An individual participant can register for whichever set of modules he or she chooses. The five modules are as follows: (1) Accessing Biomedical Big Data; (2) Data Visualization; (3) Supervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (4) Unsupervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (5) Reproducible Research for Biomedical Big Data. Each module will consist of a combination of formal lectures and hands-on computing labs. Participants will work together in teams in order to apply the skills that they develop in each module to important problems drawn from relevant case studies.  The primary audience for SISBID will consist of biomedical scientists who would like to develop the statistical and computational training needed to make use of Biomedical Big Data. The secondary audience will consist of individuals with stronger statistical or computational backgrounds but little exposure to biology, who will learn how to apply their skills to problems associated with Biomedical Big Data. Participants will include advanced undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and researchers, and will be drawn from industry, government, and academia. In order to ensure that all participants are able to fully engage in the program, participants will be expected to already have some prior background in R programming and statistical inference, which can be obtained by taking two free online courses before the program begins.  Each of the five modules will be co-taught by two instructors. The ten instructors will be drawn from top universities and research centers across the U.S., such as the University of Washington, Rice University, University of Iowa, Johns Hopkins University, MD Anderson Cancer Research Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and University of North Carolina. They have been selected based on research expertise and excellence in teaching.  Lecture videos and slides will be made freely available online so that individuals who are unable to attend SISBID in person can still benefit from the program.  This proposal specifically requests funds for 55 student / postdoctoral fellow travel scholarships per year, 130 student / postdoctoral fellow registration scholarships per year, instructor travel and stipends, teaching assistant stipends, and PI salary support. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   In recent years, the biomedical sciences have been inundated by Big Data, such as DNA sequence data and electronic medical records. In principle, it should be possible to use such data for a variety of tasks, such as predicting an individual's risk of developing diabetes or cancer, and tailoring therapies to an individual should he or she become ill. The Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data will provide biomedical researchers with the computational and statistical training needed in order to take advantage of Big Data, so that they can more effectively use it to understand human diseases and to improve human health.",Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data,8935790,R25EB020380,"['Academia', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Center', 'Case Study', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center', 'Funding', 'Government', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'NCI Center for Cancer Research', 'North Carolina', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rice', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Slide', 'Statistical Computing', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Travel', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Videotape', 'Wages', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'data visualization', 'graduate student', 'human disease', 'improved', 'instructor', 'lectures', 'member', 'open source', 'programs', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'web site']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2015,159605,0.0798839456277759
"The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to establish a national short course in Big Data Image Processing & Analysis (BigDIPA) intended to increase the number and overall skills of competent research scientists now encountering large, complex image data sources derived from cutting edge biological/biomedical research approaches. Extraction of knowledge from these imaging sources requires specialized skills and an interdisciplinary mindset. Yet effective training opportunities of this sector of the ""Big Data"" science community are glaringly underappreciated and underserved compared to other big data fields such as omics. UC Irvine is ideally suited to host a short course to address this thematic training deficit on account of the synergistic colocalization between multiple facilities, renowned for development of numerous advanced imaging techniques, and the outstanding instructional environment provided by faculty with collaborative expertise in biological image processing and computer vision, bioinformatics and high performance computational approaches.  Specifically, our BigDIPA proposal assembles an interdisciplinary alliance of faculty experts that can leverage the preeminent imaging resource facilities, such as the Laboratory of Fluorescence Dynamics (LFD) and the Beckman Laser Institute, and fuse these to ongoing campus big data initiatives, e.g. UCI's Data Science Initiative, to create a top-rated training course designed for senior graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, faculty and industry scientists from diverse scientific disciplines who have nascent interests and needs to handle BIG DATA sources beyond their current level of competency.  The course theme is focused to utilize discreet examples drawn from the analysis of complex data acquired from different microscopy imaging modalities employed to investigate dynamics in cellular and tissue processes, including signal transduction networks, development, neuroscience and biomedical applications, and that hereto where hidden or inaccessible to standard methods of analysis. Participants will be guided along the complete acquisition- processing-analysis pipeline through exposure to a coherent progression of topics and issues typically encountered when handling BIG DATA. We believe this training approach will therefore be attractive to a broad and significant untapped pool of researchers from the biological disciplines, biomedical engineering, systems biology, math, biophysics, computer science, bioinformatics and statistics who possess some, but not all, of the requisite competencies to effectively traverse the BD2K landscape. We have designed the course such that skills and experience gained by trainees will be transferable to their own research interests.  The BigDIPA course format will combine didactic lectures on the theory and foundational frameworks that underpin each step, with practical instruction on implementation and hands-on tutorials in image acquisition, large data handling, basic scripting of computational tools, image processing on high performance computing architectures, as well as feature extraction, evaluation and visualization of results. The course is designed to offer an intense learning experience delivered in a compact time frame, and opportunities to foster interdisciplinary interactions through small team exercises. Participants will also be encouraged to take advantage of pre-courses - separate and distinct training opportunities not funded by this proposal - that will be coordinated to directly precede our course. This unique format provides multiple benefits: it provides an efficient mechanism to address individual participant training deficiencies to permit a more productive experience in the BigDIPA course, adds no-cost mutual benefits to independent but synergistic programs, and facilitates recruitment of applicants who frequently feel interested but intimidated due to a perceived lack of prior adequate training.  Beyond providing an intensive on-site training course, all course materials (lecture notes, video lectures and tutorials), tutorial exercises, open source software resources and sample datasets will be made freely available through on-line distribution to maximize outreach and encourage additional contributions of curated training resources solicited from the community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We propose to train and expand the cadre of researchers capable of effectively using the deluge of complex BIG DATA being generated by advanced biomedical imaging approaches. These data sources represent a rich source of complex information relevant to many scientific areas of inquiry, and are informative at multiple scales ranging from fundamental biological processes at the cellular level to patient diagnostics for diseases such as cancer or neurological disorders.            ",The Big DIPA: Data Image Processing and Analysis,9044533,R25EB022366,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biomedical Technology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Fluorescence', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Information Sciences', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Interdisciplinary Communication', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasers', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'NIH Program Announcements', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stream', 'Systems Biology', 'TNFRSF5 gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'bioimaging', 'biological systems', 'biomedical scientist', 'citizen science', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data format', 'demographics', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'lecture notes', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'nervous system disorder', 'open source', 'outreach', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'skills', 'statistics', 'theories', 'tissue processing']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R25,2015,161997,0.08378301646036114

"Developing Cloud-based tools for Big Neural Data DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Big data has the potential to dramatically advance the electrophysiology biodata sciences in similar ways that it has transformed Genetics. Differences between these two areas dictate separate approaches to apply Big Data tools, and methods in order to provide successful assets to the research community. For one, neural datasets are very heterogeneous by nature. The data is difficult to interpret without knowing specifics about the data acquisition protocol, the experimental paradigm and the physiological state of the recorded subject. Many neural datasets are complemented with complex meta-data sets, which should be an integral component in any effort to integrate and share these data with other researchers. The goal of this project is to develop novel, generalizable Big Data tools to facilitate cloud-base analysis of complex multi-scale neural data. Epilepsy research will be used as a specific use case to guide the development of the tools. A cohort of established senior investigators performing epilepsy research will use and validate these tools in their laboratories. Epilepsy research is currently limited by its narrow focus on single models (animal or human) in individual centers and laboratories. Just as Genetics was revolutionized through Big Data techniques, so too can Epilepsy research be transformed through novel approaches to standardize, share, and mine data across groups of investigators. Over the past several years I have co-developed a NINDS funded cloud-based data platform, ://ieeg.org, giving me a central role in developing Big Data solutions for neural data, such as customized data sharing, large-scale cloud-based data analysis, and search and interrogation techniques for complex data and metadata. My scientific objectives for this project are: (1) to develop generalizable tools to curate, analyze, and interrogate multi-scale neural data, and (2) to create a platform that will galvanize a research community focused on sharing data, and methods to advance Big Data research in the basic and translational neurosciences. Equally important to this proposal, I present a training plan to prepare me for an academic career focused on Big Data in the neurosciences. This plan supplements my background in bioengineering and statistical modeling of neural data with broader data-science expertise in data integration and machine learning, and deeper domain knowledge of the clinical neurosciences. I have assembled a group of collaborators, basic investigators and clinician scientists, who will use the tools developed in this project to analyze and validate their data and methods. I will use the results of this project as the foundation for a R01 Grant application, in which I will expand the developed platform and tools to target other research domains (TBI, Emergency Care, Cardiac), as well as integrate other data-modalities such as Imaging, and Genomics.

"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond.

"A Community Effort to Translate Protein Data to Knowledge: An Integrated Platform     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inception of the BD2K Initiative is a testament to the foresight of NIH and our community. Clearly, the future of biomedicine rests on our collective ability to transform Big Data into intelligible scientific facts. In line with the BD2K objectives,our goal is to revolutionize how we address the universal challenge to discern meaning from unruly data.

"KnowEng, a Scalable Knowledge Engine for Large-Scale Genomic Data-OVERALL DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds). The KnowEng environment will be deployed in a cloud infrastructure and fully available to the community, as will be the software developed by the Center. The proposed Center is a collaboration between the University of Illinois (UIUC), a recognized world leader in computational science and engineering, and the Mayo Clinic, one of the leading clinical care and research organizations in the worid, and will be based at the UIUC Institute for Genomic Biology, which has state-of-the-art facilities and a nationally recognized program of multidisciplinary team-based genomic research.

"Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine DESCRIPTION:  As the era of ""Big Data"" is dawning on biomedical research, multiple types of biomedical data, including phenotypic, molecular (including -omics), clinical, imaging, behavioral, and environmental data is being generated on an unprecedented scale with high volume, variety and velocity. These datasets are increasingly large and complex, challenging our current abilities for data representation, integration and analysis for improving outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. It is well-recognized that the greatest challenge to leveraging the significant potentials of Big Data is in educating and recruiting future computational and data scientists who have the background, training and experience to master fundamental opportunities in biomedical sciences. This demands interdisciplinary education and hands-on practicum training on understanding the application, analysis, limitations, and value of the Big Data. To bridge this knowledge gap for the U.S. biomedical workforce, we propose to develop a research educational program-Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine (BDC4CM)-that will instruct students, fellows and scientists in the use of specific new methods and tools fo Big Data by providing tailored, in-depth instruction, hands-on laboratory modules, and case studies on Big Data access, integration, processing and analysis. Offered by highly interdisciplinary and experienced faculty from Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota, this program will provide a short- term training opportunity on Big Data methods and approaches for: 1) data and knowledge representation standards; 2) information extraction and natural language processing; 3) visualization analytics; 4) data mining and predictive modeling; 5) privacy and ethics; and 6) applications in comparative effectiveness research and population health research and improvement. Our primary educational goal is to prepare the next generation of innovators and visionaries in the emerging, multidimensional field of Big Data Science in healthcare, as well as to develop a future workforce that fulfills industry needs and increases U.S. competitiveness in healthcare technologies and applications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   The postdoctoral Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine (BDC4CM) program seeks to provide short-term education and hands-on practicum training in utilization of biomedical Big Data.

"Big Data education for the masses: MOOCs, modules, & intelligent tutoring systems DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Biomedical science, higher education, software and technology are simultaneously undergoing tectonic shifts. The amazing pace of software and technological development are driving equally amazing advances in the ability to acquire massive data sets in the biomedical sciences. These new Big Biomedical data sets come in the form of complex measurements, such as that of the brain, genome, proteome and human biome or massive databases, such as with electronic health records. Big Data issues, such as reproducibility of processing, measurement and analysis techniques, are increasingly complex, and crucial. Across all domains there is a knowledge gap of researchers to analyze and interpret these new data sets and the current higher education model cannot meet the insatiable demand for this training. We propose to make substantial progress on these issues in two domains. Specifically, we propose to use Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to create two series, one in neuroimaging and one in genomics. These series will allow for flexible, student paced, low cost scalable training for tens of thousands of students. Along with these series, we propose the creation of modular Big Data biostatistical content that can be used by students as well as teachers. This effort will be parallel to work on an intelligent tutoring syste called swirl. This application proposes to use swirl to create rich, gamified learning environments for students.

"Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)     A new electrical biomarker has been identified in high resolution, intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings, called a high frequency oscillation (HFO). Studies have suggested this biomarker has great promise to identify seizure networks and improve surgical outcomes for patients with refractory epilepsy. However, translation of HFOs to clinical practice is hampered by many factors such as spatial, temporal and inter-patient variation in HFO detection rates, false positive and false negative detections, and significant background noise. Big data approaches using large numbers of HFOs acquired from many patients are needed to quantify these effects and allow clinical usage of HFOs. This project details a plan in which the candidate's experience quantifying measurement and detection bias in massive high energy nuclear physics datasets will be combined with a multidisciplinary mentor team to address this problem. The combination of training in computational neuroscience, big data network analysis, and translational neural engineering research will be critical to approach this problem and provide a career trajectory for the candidate. The specific aims of this proposal address three specific confounding factors: 1) the false negative HFO detection rate, 2) variations in HFO features not due to epilepsy, and 3) effects of the state of vigilance on HFOs. Each of these aims involve novel big data methods and/or applications generalizable to other situations: 1) estimating false positive detection rates using a combined experimental/simulated data approach, 2) clustering and classification of distributions of data points, rather than of the data points directly, and 3) a general disambiguation statistic to assess meaningful (rather than statistical) difference between distributions.  The applicant's career goal is to become an academic researcher in the analysis and modeling of intracranial EEG data with a focus on translational epilepsy and sleep physiology research. With the rapid advancement in the resolution of clinical EEG, there is already a strong need for this type of research expertise. Thi grant will provide didactic coursework, formal research and methods training, and career guidance from an expert mentor team. The three mentors have appointments spanning Neurology, Anesthesiology, Mathematics, Statistics, Biomedical Engineering, and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. The candidate will also build and mentor a research team and establish external collaborations.  The University of Michigan is a premier research university with strong programs and training opportunities in biomedical and physical sciences, engineering, translational and academic research, and advanced research computing. This proposal makes extensive use of the University's large computer cluster. The mentor team and an external collaborator will provide candidate access to prerecorded, deidentified data from over 150 patients, estimated to have over 40 million HFOs. The environment and mentor team will provide the training, facilities, and data for the candidate to successfully complete the proposed goals.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Recent advances in epilepsy research are generating very large datasets in the search for better ways to identify the region of brain responsible for generating seizures. A particular signa known as High Frequency Oscillations found in high resolution intracranial EEG shows great promise for identifying these regions, but clinicians are unable to use the signal due to confounding biases. This project combines big data processing expertise from particle physics, computer science and machine learning to address these confounds, providing a more accurate process to enable clinical translation of this new biomarker and potentially improve clinical outcomes.                ",Epileptic biomarkers and big data: identifying brain regions to resect in patients with refractory epilepsy,9041723,K01ES026839,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesiology', 'Appointment', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Manpower and Training', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Neurology', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Physics', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep', 'Solutions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer cluster', 'computer science', 'computerized data processing', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'particle physics', 'patient population', 'physical science', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'scientific computing', 'signal processing', 'sleep epilepsy', 'spatial temporal variation', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tool', 'vigilance']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2015,138213,-0.04354084382515068
"Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    My goal in seeking a K01 Award is to acquire the necessary training to become an independently funded investigator focused on exploiting the power of biomedical Big Data Science to improve outcome following severe injury. I am a trauma surgeon at San Francisco General Hospital, one of the Nation's leading trauma centers, and an Assistant Professor of Surgery at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF). UCSF has recently entered into collaboration with the National Laboratories to study the use of biomedical Big Data in complex clinical conditions and my main mentor, Dr. Mitchell J. Cohen is the lead investigator at UCSF for this collaboration. I believe that given the complexity of the factors that likely affect traum outcome including patient injury patterns, medical co-morbidities, patient biology, and the system of care, trauma provides a solid foundation to study the utility of Big Data Science for solving complex medical questions. To facilitate my growth as an expert in this field, I am proposing to develop a framework for integrating multiple data sources necessary to forecast patient outcomes following trauma. These novel datasets combined with biologic and metadata will then be utilized to create improved metrics that better predict complication risk from modifiable and non-modifiable factors. The net result of this work is a new approach to data ascertainment for measuring outcome, leveraging new data types to improve prediction of patient trajectory, and creating a platform to interface with existing information technology to ultimately be used for an early warning detection system for patients at risk of complications. The future long-term goal of this work would be to identify early patients predicted to do more poorly and then apply refinements to the process of care to minimize complication development. The creation of early warning detection systems has significant theoretic potential to improve quality and ultimately decrease costs. Nearly $30 billion per year in the US is spent on care for the traumatically injured and the development of post-traumatic complications is believed to be major contributor to the overall costs of care. The ability to report performance has been hampered by a lack of standard definitions, reporting bias, access to datasets, and the analysis techniques that fail to account for the highly confounded relationships contributing to patient outcome. This K01 award will provide me with the support necessary to accomplish the following goals: (1) to become an expert in applying biologic big data to trauma care (2) to elucidate the relationship of modifiable factors affecting complication development (3) to gain experience with advanced biostatistical techniques and bioinformatics; and (4) to develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, I have assembled a multidisciplinary team including Dr. Cohen, a National expert in trauma systems biology and biologic big data, and two co-mentors: Dr. Michael Matthay, a translational research expert in complications after severe illness, and Dr. Alan Hubbard, an expert in advanced biostatistical techniques including biologic big data analysis.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    In the US, trauma is the leading cause of death for those under 45 years old and many of the patients who survive their initial injuries develop complications such as blood clots or pneumonia that contribute to both death and the long-term effects of the trauma. Through leveraging the power of biomedical Big Data, an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing integrated EMR early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early with the intent to ultimately refie the process of care for this group to minimize complication development.                ",Advancing Outcome Metrics in Trauma Surgery Through Utilization of Big Data,9043721,K01ES026834,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood coagulation', 'California', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Demographic Aging', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Geographic Locations', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'High Performance Computing', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Long-Term Effects', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pneumonia', 'Process', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'care systems', 'career', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'disability', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'injured', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'professor', 'public health relevance', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers']",NIEHS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K01,2015,222898,0.049500250646782276
"UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award UTMB's CTSA-linked KL2 Scholars Program addresses the significant need for developing future clinical and translational (C&T) investigators, with emphases on team-based research, leadership development, and mentorship training. In our new CTSA hub, we will build on our current CTSA's successes over the past 5½ years, with unique innovative integration of exceptional training approaches, including: 1) mentored career development within CTSA-supported multidisciplinary translational teams (MTTs); 2) an emphasis on individual development plans (IDPs) and pre-established C&T research competencies tailored to the needs of the individual scholar, but also emphasizing team-based competencies; 3) development of leadership competencies through participation in a new Leadership Development Academy; 4) an Academy of Research Mentors (ARM), based within our Institute for Translational Sciences (ITS), to foster mentoring and mentor training; 5) a linked Translational Research Scholars Program (TRSP), which provides an expanded peer group and a wider impact across the institution, with twice-monthly career development seminars and a focus on scholars' research; 6) development of entrepreneurial skills and leadership through participation in a UT System-funded Healthcare Entrepreneurship Program; and 7) collaboration and dissemination of program experience to other CTSA hubs in the Texas Regional CTSA Consortium, and the national CTSA Consortium. An important feature of our KL2 Scholars Program is its linked position within the continuum of career development, from graduate student training in our CTSA TL1 Training Core to the production of independently funded C&T faculty members. Our program is enhanced with by financial support from our Provost's office for scholar expenses, ITS education administrators, the ARM, and the Office of Faculty Affairs, which is focused on faculty development at UTMB. UTMB also ranks nationally in promoting diversity, which will enhance our recruitment of underrepresented minority scholars by the participation of faculty from our Hispanic Center of Excellence, and our Medical School Enrichment Program. Our KL2 Program is well-integrated with other institutional education activities, including our Human Pathophysiology and Translational Medicine graduate program, and courses targeted toward scientific writing, biostatistics, and study design. Early-career faculty as Phase 1 TRSP scholars can compete to become CTSA-supported KL2 Scholars, and with acquisition of their first mentored K-level grants (e.g., K08), advance to a Phase 2 TRSP Scholar, then focusing on the transition from mentored to independent grant funding. Upon acquisition of independent (e.g. R01) funding, scholars advance to become Phase 3 TRSP Scholars and Associate Members in the ARM, to facilitate their development of mentoring skills, and eventually to full ARM membership, with demonstrated success in C&T science mentoring. Our KL2 Scholars Program thus integrates novel team-based training, leadership, and mentoring approaches to foster the career development of future leaders in C&T research. n/a",UTMB Clinical and Translational Science Award,9085705,KL2TR001441,"['Academy', 'Address', 'Administrator', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Biopsy', 'Body Surface Area', 'Burn injury', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Down-Regulation', 'Education', 'Enrollment', 'Entrepreneurship', 'Evolution', 'Faculty', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Healthcare', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hispanics', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interferons', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Link', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peer Group', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protocols documentation', 'Regimen', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Rice', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Variant', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'college', 'demographics', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'innovation', 'liver biopsy', 'medical schools', 'member', 'microbial', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'peripheral blood', 'programs', 'response', 'science education', 'skills', 'success', 'translational medicine']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS MED BR GALVESTON,KL2,2015,388145,0.07571843775200461
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,8935802,U54EB020405,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'models and simulation', 'motor impairment', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2015,401742,0.05806508921011966
"The q-bio Summer School DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems. The complexity and importance of these systems, which govern cellular activities and fates, provides motivation for developing a scientific and engineering workforce equipped to deal with the complexity.",The q-bio Summer School,8802880,R25GM105608,"['Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Career Choice', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Minority-Serving Institution', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Participant', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Qualifying', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biochemical model', 'biological research', 'career', 'career development', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'demographics', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'interest', 'lecture notes', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'model design', 'multidisciplinary', 'peer', 'physical science', 'posters', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NIGMS,"NEW MEXICO CONSORTIUM, INC.",R25,2015,169997,0.08111148442625922
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,8832593,P30ES006096,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Allergic Disease', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health education', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Nature', 'Neurology', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Power Plants', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'environmental agent', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'health science research', 'high risk', 'human capital', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lipid disorder', 'malignant endocrine gland neoplasm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'symposium']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2015,1735289,0.04612544999097422

"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. !         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.             ",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,8628140,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2014,59383,0.03831810594147258
"Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data     DESCRIPTION:  Funding is sought for the Summer Institute for Statistics of Big Data (SISBID) at the University of Washington. This program will provide workshops on the statistical and computational skills needed to access, process, manage, and analyze large biomedical data sets. It will be co-directed by Ali Shojaie and Daniela Witten, faculty in the Department of Biostatistics at University of Washington.  The SISBID program will consist of five 2.5-day in-person courses, or modules, taught at the University of Washington each July. An individual participant can register for whichever set of modules he or she chooses. The five modules are as follows: (1) Accessing Biomedical Big Data; (2) Data Visualization; (3) Supervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (4) Unsupervised Methods for Statistical Machine Learning; (5) Reproducible Research for Biomedical Big Data. Each module will consist of a combination of formal lectures and hands-on computing labs. Participants will work together in teams in order to apply the skills that they develop in each module to important problems drawn from relevant case studies.  The primary audience for SISBID will consist of biomedical scientists who would like to develop the statistical and computational training needed to make use of Biomedical Big Data. The secondary audience will consist of individuals with stronger statistical or computational backgrounds but little exposure to biology, who will learn how to apply their skills to problems associated with Biomedical Big Data. Participants will include advanced undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and researchers, and will be drawn from industry, government, and academia. In order to ensure that all participants are able to fully engage in the program, participants will be expected to already have some prior background in R programming and statistical inference, which can be obtained by taking two free online courses before the program begins.  Each of the five modules will be co-taught by two instructors. The ten instructors will be drawn from top universities and research centers across the U.S., such as the University of Washington, Rice University, University of Iowa, Johns Hopkins University, MD Anderson Cancer Research Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and University of North Carolina. They have been selected based on research expertise and excellence in teaching.  Lecture videos and slides will be made freely available online so that individuals who are unable to attend SISBID in person can still benefit from the program.  This proposal specifically requests funds for 55 student / postdoctoral fellow travel scholarships per year, 130 student / postdoctoral fellow registration scholarships per year, instructor travel and stipends, teaching assistant stipends, and PI salary support.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   In recent years, the biomedical sciences have been inundated by Big Data, such as DNA sequence data and electronic medical records.

"Developing Cloud-based tools for Big Neural Data     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Big data has the potential to dramatically advance the electrophysiology biodata sciences in similar ways that it has transformed Genetics. Differences between these two areas dictate separate approaches to apply Big Data tools, and methods in order to provide successful assets to the research community. For one, neural datasets are very heterogeneous by nature. The data is difficult to interpret without knowing specifics about the data acquisition protocol, the experimental paradigm and the physiological state of the recorded subject. Many neural datasets are complemented with complex meta-data sets, which should be an integral component in any effort to integrate and share these data with other researchers. The goal of this project is to develop novel, generalizable Big Data tools to facilitate cloud-base analysis of complex multi-scale neural data. Epilepsy research will be used as a specific use case to guide the development of the tools. A cohort of established senior investigators performing epilepsy research will use and validate these tools in their laboratories. Epilepsy research is currently limited by its narrow focus on single models (animal or human) in individual centers and laboratories. Just as Genetics was revolutionized through Big Data techniques, so too can Epilepsy research be transformed through novel approaches to standardize, share, and mine data across groups of investigators. Over the past several years I have co-developed a NINDS funded cloud-based data platform, ://ieeg.org, giving me a central role in developing Big Data solutions for neural data, such as customized data sharing, large-scale cloud-based data analysis, and search and interrogation techniques for complex data and metadata. My scientific objectives for this project are: (1) to develop generalizable tools to curate, analyze, and interrogate multi-scale neural data, and (2) to create a platform that will galvanize a research community focused on sharing data, and methods to advance Big Data research in the basic and translational neurosciences. Equally important to this proposal, I present a training plan to prepare me for an academic career focused on Big Data in the neurosciences. This plan supplements my background in bioengineering and statistical modeling of neural data with broader data-science expertise in data integration and machine learning, and deeper domain knowledge of the clinical neurosciences. I have assembled a group of collaborators, basic investigators and clinician scientists, who will use the tools developed in this project to analyze and validate their data and methods. I will use the results of this project as the foundation for a R01 Grant application, in which I will expand the developed platform and tools to target other research domains (TBI, Emergency Care, Cardiac), as well as integrate other data-modalities such as Imaging, and Genomics.

"Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am applying for mentored career development through the BD2K initiative to gain the skills and expertise necessary to transition to an independent research career developing methods for the analysis of ""big data"" in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Following my Ph.D. training in theoretical physics, I transitioned into computational neuroscience, where I have focused on problems in the neurophysiology of reward and decision-making, particularly models of reinforcement learning and choice behavior. For the last five years, I have also gained extensive experience in electrophysiological recording in both human surgical patients and non-human primates, deepening my appreciation of the difficulties involved in analyzing real neuroscience data. During this time, I have become convinced that the single most pressing challenge for neuroscience in the next decade will be the problem of how we process, analyze, and synthesize the rapidly expanding volumes of data made available by new technologies, and as I transition to the faculty level, I am seeking to orient my own research program toward these goals. To do so, I will need to complement my strong quantitative background and electrophysiological recording skills with specific training in machine learning, signal processing, and analysis of data from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am focusing on the first because the statistics of data analysis are an essential core competency for any big data researcher; on the second because understanding the methods by which we process and acquire data are as essential as how we analyze them; and on the third because not only are fMRI data among the most readily available large datasets, but effective analysis of fMRI data will have immediate clinical applications. For this project, I have assembled a team of mentors with strong and overlapping expertise in these three areas. These mentors have committed to support my transition to a focus on big data research, an approach that builds on multiple existing collaborations I have with laboratories at Duke. My ultimate goal is to head a lab in which I apply the skills and training I acquire during the award period to developing computational methods that will harness the power of big data to answer fundamental questions in cognitive and translational neuroscience. Environment. Duke University is home to outstanding resources in both neuroscience and big data research. Its interdisciplinary big data effort, the Information Initiative at Duke, brings together researchers from statistics, computer science, and electrical engineering with those in genetics, neuroscience, and social science to facilitate collaboration across the disciplines. The Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, with which I am affiliated, comprises over 150 faculty across the brain sciences at Duke, from clinicians to biomedical engineers. I will be mentored by Dr. David Dunson, a recognized leader in Bayesian statistical methods for machine learning, along with Dr. Lawrence Carin and Dr. Guillermo Sapiro, experts in signal and image processing and machine learning and frequent collaborators with Dr. Dunson. In addition Dr. Scott Huettel, an expert in fMRI and author of a leading neuroimaging textbook, will oversee my training in fMRI data analysis. Moreover, I will have access to data from a large and diverse pool of laboratories at Duke, including one of the largest neuroimaging datasets in the country. Most importantly, Duke is fully committed to supporting me with the resources and time necessary to pursue the training outlined in this career development award. Research. Each year, one in four adults suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder, with 1 in 25 suffering from a serious mental illness. Yet our ability to anticipate the onset of mental illness - even our ability to understand its effets within the brain - has been limited by the recognition that these diseases are not primarily disorders of independent units, but patterns of pathological brain activation. However, we currently lack a meaningful characterization of patterns of activity within neural networks, and thus the ability to discuss, discover, and treat them effectively. Yet an improvement in our abilit to characterize and detect these patterns would result in major clinical impact. Therefore, under the guidance of my mentoring team, I propose to characterize patterns of network activity in neuroscience datasets using methods from machine learning. Because many mental illnesses are typified either by a pathological relationship between sufferers and stimuli in the world (post traumatic stress disorder, eating disorders) or intrinsic patterns of disordered thought (major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder), I focus on three key questions for pattern detection: 1) How does the brain encode complex, unstructured stimuli? 2) What are the basic building blocks of healthy and diseased patterns of intrinsic brain activity? 3) How do patterns of brain activity change in response to changes in behavioral state? My approach makes use of recent advances in Bayesian nonparametric methods, as well as fast variational inference approaches that scale well to large datasets. In addition, because the datasets I will use, fMRI and electrophysiology data, are particular examples of the much larger class of multichannel time series data, the results will apply more broadly to other types of data, in neuroscience and beyond.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent evidence suggests that most mental illnesses result from disruptions in normal patterns of brain activity. Yet discovering, detecting, and describing these patterns of activity has proven difficult to do in conventional experiments. This project wil develop computer algorithms for pattern detection that can be applied to the scientific study and early diagnosis of mental illness.            ",Nonparametric Bayes Methods for Big Data in Neuroscience,8830000,K01ES025442,"['Accounting', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Award', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Calcium', 'Choice Behavior', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Commit', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impulsivity', 'Institutes', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Sciences', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'independent component analysis', 'interest', 'learned behavior', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'research study', 'response', 'severe mental illness', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'skills training', 'social', 'statistics', 'translational neuroscience']",NIEHS,DUKE UNIVERSITY,K01,2014,151804,0.04319275949105305
"KnowEng, a Scalable Knowledge Engine for Large-Scale Genomic Data-OVERALL     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG. KnowEnG will transform the way biomedical researchers analyze their genome-wide data by integrating multiple analytical methods derived from the most advanced data mining and machine learning research to use the full breadth of existing knowledge about the relationships between genes as background, and providing an intuitive and professionally designed user interface. In order to achieve these goals, the project includes the following components: (1) gathering and integrating existing knowledgebases documenting connections between genes and their functions into a single Knowledge Network; (2) developing computational methods for analyzing genome-wide user datasets in the context of this pre-existing knowledge; (3) implementing these methods into scalable software components that can be deployed in a public or private cloud; (4) designing and implementing a Web-based user interface, based on the HUBZero toolkit, that enables the interactive analysis of user-supplied datasets in a graphics-driven and intuitive fashion; (5) thoroughly testing the functionality and usefulness of the KnowEnG environment in three large scale projects in the clinical sciences (pharmacogenomics of breast cancer), behavioral sciences (identification of gene regulatory modules underlying behavioral patterns) and drug discovery (genome-based prediction of the capacity of microorganisms to synthesize novel biologically active compounds). The KnowEng environment will be deployed in a cloud infrastructure and fully available to the community, as will be the software developed by the Center.

"A Community Effort to Translate Protein Data to Knowledge: An Integrated Platform     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The inception of the BD2K Initiative is a testament to the foresight of NIH and our community. Clearly, the future of biomedicine rests on our collective ability to transform Big Data into intelligible scientific facts. In line with the BD2K objectives,our goal is to revolutionize how we address the universal challenge to discern meaning from unruly data. Capitalizing on our investigators' complementary strengths in computational biology and cardiovascular medicine, we will present a fusion of cutting-edge innovations that are grounded in a cardiovascular research focus, encompassing: (i) on-the-cloud data processing, (ii) crowd sourcing and text-mining data annotation, (iii) protein spatiotemporal dynamics, (iv) multi-omic integration, and (v) multiscale clinical data modeling. Drawing from our decade of experience in creating and refining bioinformatics tools, we propose to amalgamate established Big Data resources into a generalizable model for data annotation and collaborative research, through a new query system and cloud infrastructure for accessing multiple omics repositories, and through computational-supported crowdsourcing initiatives for mining the biomedical literature. We propose to interweave diverse data types for revealing biological networks that coalesce from molecular entities at multiple scales, through machine learning methods for structuring molecular data and defining relationships with drugs and diseases, and through novel algorithms for on-the-cloud integration and pathway visualization of multi-dimensional molecular data. Moreover, we propose to innovate advanced modeling tools to resolve protein dynamics and spatiotemporal molecular mechanisms, through mechanistic modeling of protein properties and 3D protein expression maps, and through Bayesian algorithms that correlate patient phenotypes, health histories, and multi-scale molecular profiles. The utility and customizability o our tools to the broader research population is clearly demonstrated using three archetypical workflows that enable annotations of large lists of genes, transcripts, proteins, or metabolites; powerful analysis of complex protein datasets acquired over time; and seamless aQoregation of diverse molecular, textual and literature data. These workflows will be rigorously validated using data from two significant clinical cohorts, the Jackson Heart Study and the Healthy Elderly Longevity (Wellderly). In parallel, a multifaceted strategy will be implemented to educate and train biomedical investigators, and to engage the public for promoting the overall BD2K initiative. We are convinced that a community-driven BD2K initiative will best realize its scientific potential and transform the research culture in a sustainable manner, exhibiting lasting success beyond the current funding period.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The challenges of biomedical Big Data are multifaceted. Biomedical investigators face daunting tasks of storing, analyzing, and distributing large-scale omics data, and aggregating all information to discern mechanistic insights. A coherent effort is required to harness disarrayed Big Data and transform them into intelligible scientific facts, whil engaging the global community via education and outreach programs.

"Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine     DESCRIPTION:  As the era of ""Big Data"" is dawning on biomedical research, multiple types of biomedical data, including phenotypic, molecular (including -omics), clinical, imaging, behavioral, and environmental data is being generated on an unprecedented scale with high volume, variety and velocity. These datasets are increasingly large and complex, challenging our current abilities for data representation, integration and analysis for improving outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. It is well-recognized that the greatest challenge to leveraging the significant potentials of Big Data is in educating and recruiting future computational and data scientists who have the background, training and experience to master fundamental opportunities in biomedical sciences. This demands interdisciplinary education and hands-on practicum training on understanding the application, analysis, limitations, and value of the Big Data. To bridge this knowledge gap for the U.S. biomedical workforce, we propose to develop a research educational program-Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine (BDC4CM)-that will instruct students, fellows and scientists in the use of specific new methods and tools fo Big Data by providing tailored, in-depth instruction, hands-on laboratory modules, and case studies on Big Data access, integration, processing and analysis. Offered by highly interdisciplinary and experienced faculty from Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota, this program will provide a short- term training opportunity on Big Data methods and approaches for: 1) data and knowledge representation standards; 2) information extraction and natural language processing; 3) visualization analytics; 4) data mining and predictive modeling; 5) privacy and ethics; and 6) applications in comparative effectiveness research and population health research and improvement. Our primary educational goal is to prepare the next generation of innovators and visionaries in the emerging, multidimensional field of Big Data Science in healthcare, as well as to develop a future workforce that fulfills industry needs and increases U.S. competitiveness in healthcare technologies and applications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:   The postdoctoral Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine (BDC4CM) program seeks to provide short-term education and hands-on practicum training in utilization of biomedical Big Data. BDC4CM will address a major need for the U.S. biomedical workforce to develop and enhance existing skills in application, analysis, limitations, and value of the Big Data.            ",Big Data Coursework for Computational Medicine,8827881,R25EB020381,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Bioethics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Research', 'Case Study', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Committee Members', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Industry', 'Informatics', 'Instruction', 'Interdisciplinary Education', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laws', 'Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Minnesota', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Privacy', 'Process', 'Program Reviews', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Surveys', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'comparative effectiveness', 'computer science', 'data mining', 'effectiveness research', 'experience', 'improved', 'information organization', 'instrument', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'population health', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'working group']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R25,2014,153437,0.08090219479849381
"Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current approaches to medical education produce new physicians with insufficient clinical competency to practice effectively with limited supervision, which has serious implications for patient outcomes during hospital off hours. Up to 70% of patients admitted to a hospital are admitted on nights or weekends, when staffing is low and residents may be in charge of patient care. Off-hours care is linked to an increase in medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates. Negative patient outcomes during off hours are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of residents in their first postgraduate year. We propose to improve undergraduate medical education to minimize the time to clinical competency for first year residents through targeted diagnostic reasoning skill development that (1) integrates basic science and clinical instruction; (2) provides deliberate practice with structured, case-based learning opportunities; and (3) enables anytime/anywhere learning that fits with the demanding schedules of most medical students. Southern Illinois University School of Medicine (SIUSOM) is a recognized leader in using performance-based clinical competency exams to enhance reasoning skill acquisition among medical students. These exams feature clinical scenarios with standardized patients followed by diagnostic justification essays which require students to explicitly describe the thought process used to reach a final diagnosis. These essays are the most reliable method of assessing diagnostic strategies but are not in use in the majority of medical schools, though interest in improving diagnostic reasoning instruction and assessment during undergraduate medical education is widespread. Barriers to the widespread adoption of this approach are 1) the time-consuming need to hand score each essay; and 2) the difficulty in accurately and consistently identifying the causes of strategy failures. This project will develop an application to provide automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of the underlying causes of failure when students perform poorly, and feedback with instructional strategies for remediation specific to each deficit. We propose these specific aims: 1) Develop a scoring algorithm that automatically evaluates students' written justifications of diagnostic strategy. 2) Build a taxonomy of strategy failures from students' diagnostic justifications. 3) Work closely with SIUSOM and other medical schools contemplating the addition of diagnostic reasoning assessment to their curriculum. Phase II will focus on additional specific aims: 4) Develop an application based on the Phase I proof of concept with refined algorithms for scoring, categorizing reasoning failures and targeted remediation. 5) Evaluate the learning application for usability, acceptance via focus groups, and effectiveness via a limited field trial with students at SIUSOM. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: During hospital off hours negative patient outcomes including medical errors, surgical complications, and readmission rates are 2 to 8 times more likely to occur under the care of first year residents. Better preparation during undergraduate medical education can shorten the time to competency of first year residents, improving patient outcomes. We propose to develop and test a technology-enabled, deliberate-practice approach to training diagnostic strategy that includes automated scoring of diagnostic justification essays, identification of specific diagnostic strategy failures and targeted remediation. The proposed product represents a significant shift in undergraduate medical training and through Phase III dissemination will address a critical gap between education and practice in academic medicine.            ",Advanced Assessment to Accelerate Diagnostic Skill Acquisition,8703305,R41GM108104,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Categories', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Competence', 'Consult', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Technology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Focus Groups', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Illinois', 'Incubators', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Medical Errors', 'Medical Students', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Plant Roots', 'Preparation', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Residencies', 'Role', 'Schedule', 'Semantics', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Surgical complication', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validity and Reliability', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'case-based', 'essays', 'evidence base', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'medical malpractice', 'medical schools', 'patient safety', 'public health relevance', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'success', 'technology development', 'theories', 'undergraduate medical education', 'usability']",NIGMS,"PARALLEL CONSULTING, LLC",R41,2014,144721,0.028377876402308745
"Big Data education for the masses: MOOCs, modules, & intelligent tutoring systems     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Abstract Biomedical science, higher education, software and technology are simultaneously undergoing tectonic shifts. The amazing pace of software and technological development are driving equally amazing advances in the ability to acquire massive data sets in the biomedical sciences. These new Big Biomedical data sets come in the form of complex measurements, such as that of the brain, genome, proteome and human biome or massive databases, such as with electronic health records. Big Data issues, such as reproducibility of processing, measurement and analysis techniques, are increasingly complex, and crucial. Across all domains there is a knowledge gap of researchers to analyze and interpret these new data sets and the current higher education model cannot meet the insatiable demand for this training. We propose to make substantial progress on these issues in two domains. Specifically, we propose to use Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to create two series, one in neuroimaging and one in genomics. These series will allow for flexible, student paced, low cost scalable training for tens of thousands of students. Along with these series, we propose the creation of modular Big Data biostatistical content that can be used by students as well as teachers. This effort will be parallel to work on an intelligent tutoring syste called swirl. This application proposes to use swirl to create rich, gamified learning environments for students. All of the material created from this grant will be open access and free.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Project narrative: We propose two Massive Open Online Course series in neuroimaging and genomic Big Data analysis as well as the creation of modular Big Data statistics content and content creation for an intelligent tutoring system.            ","Big Data education for the masses: MOOCs, modules, & intelligent tutoring systems",8829370,R25EB020378,"['Adopted', 'Amaze', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cost Analysis', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Drops', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Models', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Medicine', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Principal Investigator', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Nurses', 'Public Health Nursing', 'Race', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Services', 'Solutions', 'Stream', 'Students', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'cost', 'density', 'flexibility', 'instructor', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'operation', 'process repeatability', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R25,2014,216000,0.07334903877247785
"Mobility Data Integration to Insight     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mobility is essential for human health. Regular physical activity helps prevent heart disease and stroke, relieves symptoms of depression, and promotes weight loss. Unfortunately, many conditions, such as cerebral palsy, osteoarthritis, and obesity, limit mobility at an enormous personal and societal cost. While vast amounts of data are available from hundreds of research labs and millions of smartphones, there is a dearth of methods for analyzing this massive, heterogeneous dataset.  We propose to establish the National Center for Mobility Data Integration to Insight (the Mobilize Center) to overcome the data science challenges facing mobility big data and biomedical big data in general. Our preliminary work identified four bottlenecks in data science, which drive four Data Science Research Cores.  The Cores include Biomechanical Modeling, Statistical Learning, Behavioral and Social Modeling, and Integrative Modeling and Prediction. Our Cores will produce novel methods to integrate diverse modeling modalities and gain insight from noisy, sparse, heterogeneous, and time-varying big data. Our data-sharing consortia, with clinical, research, and industry partners, will provide mobility data for over ten million people.  Three Driving Biomedical Problems will focus and validate our data science research.  The Mobilize Center will disseminate our novel data science tools to thousands of researchers and create a sustainable data-sharing consortium. We will train tens of thousands of scientists to use data science methods in biomedicine through our in-person and online educational programs. We will establish a cohesive, vibrant, and sustainable National Center through the leadership of an experienced executive team and will help unify the BD2K consortia through our Biomedical Computation Review publication and the Simtk.org resource portal.  The Mobilize Center will lay the groundwork for the next generation of data science systems and revolutionize diagnosis and treatment for millions of people affected by limited mobility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Regular physical activity is essential for human health, yet a broad range of conditions impair mobility. This project will transform human movement research by developing tools for data analysis and creating software that will advance research to prevent, diagnose, and reduce impairments that limit human movement.            ",Mobility Data Integration to Insight,8775015,U54EB020405,"['Affect', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Big Data', 'Biomechanics', 'Biomedical Computing', 'Biomedical Research', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Elderly', 'Ethics', 'Exercise', 'Fellowship', 'Fostering', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Joints', 'Leadership', 'Limb structure', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Movement', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Nature', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Overweight', 'Pathology', 'Persons', 'Physical activity', 'Prevention', 'Problem Solving', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resource Sharing', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Visit', 'Walking', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'cognitive function', 'cohesion', 'cost', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'depressive symptoms', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'models and simulation', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'role model', 'sensor', 'social', 'social model', 'tool']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,U54,2014,209258,0.05806508921011966
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist. Thus, these aims are achieved through financial awards, mentorship, access to core resources and other career development activities.                  Our environmental health center focuses on understanding how genes and environment affect our health,  serving the residents, communities of Ohio, the nation and the globe by generating knowledge that is  applicable to the general public and policymakers for healthier living.",Center for Environmental Genetics,8670743,P30ES006096,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Air', 'Allergic Disease', 'Area', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Barker Hypothesis', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Outreach', 'Complex', 'Core Facility', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economics', 'Educational workshop', 'Endocrine disruption', 'Environment', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health education', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Nature', 'Neurology', 'Ohio', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Power Plants', 'Predisposition', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Series', 'Staging', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Transportation', 'Update', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'environmental agent', 'epigenome', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genome wide association study', 'health science research', 'high risk', 'human capital', 'innovation', 'insight', 'lipid disorder', 'malignant endocrine gland neoplasm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'programs', 'response', 'success', 'symposium']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,P30,2014,1739696,0.04612544999097422
"The q-bio Summer School     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the Annual q-bio Summer School, founded in 2007 in Los Alamos, NM, is to advance predictive modeling of cellular regulatory systems by providing trtaining in mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques that are important in systems and synthetic biology. A secondary goal is to advance the careers of researchers new to quantitative biology. The school consists of courses in six subjects: 1) stochastic gene regulation, 2) cell signaling, 3) biomolecular simulations, 4) viral dynamics, 5) synthetic biology, and 6) computational neuroscience. Demand for training in quantitative biology is increasing rapidly-the number of qualified summer school applicants increased from fewer than 40 in 2010 to over 170 in 2012. In response to this demand, we expanded the school in 2012 to accommodate more students. The school now takes place at two campuses, in Santa Fe, NM (courses 1-4) and in San Diego, CA (courses 5-6). Approximately 30 students attend at each campus and are diverse in terms of educational background (mathematics, engineering, physical sciences, and biology), career level (~75% are graduate students, ~20% are postdocs, and ~5% are more advanced), and demographics (gender, race, ethnicity, and worldwide geographical origin). Students attend all core lectures in the courses offered at their campus, as well as specialized course-specific lectures, student get-to-know-me talks, and other talks (e.g., talks focused on career skills), and participate in hands-on computer labs and mentored projects. After two intensive weeks, all students gather in Santa Fe for a 2-day q- bio Student Symposium, which features student projects reports, student poster presentations, and external invited speakers. All students then attend the 4-day q-bio Conference, an international conference attended by >200 researchers. All q-bio Summer School participants can expect the following: a) broad exposure to mathematical/statistical/computational tools used in quantitative biology, b) in-depth training in techniques of special interest (i.e., in one of the six course subjects) through course-specific lectures, computer labs, and mentored projects; c) multiple opportunities to practice scientific communication through talks and poster presentations; d) exposure to cutting-edge research, and e) extensive networking opportunities with peers and thought leaders. Lecturers and speakers include more than 50 different researchers active in quantitative biology, including very distinguished scientists. For example, in 2013, confirmed lecturers include six academicians. By the time the students attend the q-bio Conference, they are equipped with a powerful social network that facilitates interactions, idea exchange, and initiation of collaborative research. The long-term goal of the school is to change the way biological research is conducted, making biology a more quantitative field, like physics and chemistry. In this effort, the organizers are supported by significant goodwill from the international quantitative biology community and a number of local institutions, including two national centers for systems biology. However, to maintain and improve the school, additional financial support is required.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many future biomedical and biotechnological advances in synthetic and systems biology will require investigators who have the ability to carefully integrate quantitative experimentation with mathematical, statistical and computational modeling. The goal of the q-bio Summer School is to prepare a new generation of quantitative biologists who are adept at modeling and/or working with modelers to advance our predictive understanding of cellular regulatory systems.

"Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for an intensive ten-day course on Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology. The course is designed for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and takes place at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. The course is the first of its kind, giving students formal training in computer vision for the specific analysis of cell and developmental biology image data. Building strong foundations in this topic is critical for pushing cell and developmental biology forward, as imaging has become more and more an indispensable tool in these fields. The course covers the fundamentals of computer vision, taking the students through the sequence of low-, intermediate-, and high-level computer vision tasks that are required to solve image analysis problems in quantitative cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum starts with filtering, thresholding and edge/line/generic feature detection, followed by more sophisticated detection algorithms that employ model fitting. After this introductory block to low-level computer vision tasks, the course moves on to intermediate and higher-level tasks, including object association in space and time (such as tracking) and machine learning tools for phenotype classification. Each topic is covered first by a lecture, generally taught by one of the four core faculty, followed by a 3-4 hour computer programming session where students immediately implement the concepts they learn. There are usually two lectures + computer labs per day. Most programming exercises are individual, giving each student the opportunity to ""get their hands dirty,"" while two are team projects allowing the students to also learn and practice methods of code sharing. Over the course's ten days there are three guest lectures by leading researchers in the fields of biological imaging and computer vision, each followed by in-depth discussion, as well as research talks given by the students, faculty and teaching assistants. With this, the core lectures and labs teach the students the fundamentals of computer vision in a logical, continuous manner, the guest lecturers introduce the students to exciting new challenges in imaging and image analysis, and the student/faculty research talks encourage communication between all course participants and give especially the students the opportunity to reflect on how the course can help them with their research. !         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Imaging has become an indispensable tool in cellular and developmental biology research, but without rigorous, quantitative image analysis it cannot achieve its full potential. This proposal requests support for a new course that will fill the voidof education in computer vision as applied to cellular and developmental biology. The curriculum incorporates a carefully balanced mixture of lectures and associated programming exercises. We have given a pilot course once in October 2010, with very positive reviews from the students and their advisers.             ",Computational Image Analysis for Cellular and Developmental Biology,8414506,R25GM103792,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Cellular biology', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Communication', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Equilibrium', 'Exercise', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Generic Drugs', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Request for Proposals', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Seeds', 'Software Design', 'Solid', 'Students', 'Time', 'Training', 'Wood material', 'computer program', 'design', 'graduate student', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIGMS,MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY,R25,2013,59383,0.03831810594147258

The complexity and importance of these systems, which govern cellular activities and fates, provides motivation for developing a scientific and engineering workforce equipped to deal with the complexity.            ",The q-bio Summer School,8475276,R25GM105608,"['Behavior', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Career Choice', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Education', 'Educational Background', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Support', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'International', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Mentors', 'Minority-Serving Institution', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurons', 'Occupations', 'Participant', 'Physics', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Qualifying', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Network', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Models', 'Students', 'Synthetic Genes', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Viral', 'Woman', 'Work', 'biochemical model', 'biological research', 'career', 'career development', 'computational neuroscience', 'computerized tools', 'demographics', 'graduate student', 'improved', 'interest', 'lecture notes', 'lecturer', 'lectures', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'model design', 'multidisciplinary', 'peer', 'physical science', 'posters', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'simulation', 'skills', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'synthetic biology', 'tool']",NIGMS,"NEW MEXICO CONSORTIUM, INC.",R25,2013,174626,0.08111148442625922
"Center for Environmental Genetics     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        It is a priority of the CEG and the Career Development Program to identify and develop the careers of promising early stage investigators. To accomplish this goal, the overall objective of the career development program (CDP) is to recruit, enrich, encourage, and provide resources and mentoring activities to investigators at the graduate, postgraduate and early faculty levels with a particular emphasis on environmental health science. The CDP has forged new cross-disciplinary partnerships in areas applicable to environmental health science with basic, epidemiological, and/or clinical studies including studies in molecular genetics and environmental epidemiology and environmental toxicology.  To accomplish the overall objective, the CDP has developed a highly innovative approach with three specific.  Aim 1 is to attract, recruit and promote opportunities for junior faculty (within three years from initial appointment) towards development of an independent career interfacing between basic, translational or clinical investigations with application to environmental health science. The Next Generation Biomedical Investigator (NGBI) program is the principal mechanism for achieving this aim.  Aim 2 is to identify investigators with less experience (novice investigators) who are still in trainin with minimal experience but have an interest in examining the intricate role of environmental health science in health and disease. Recruits include physicians in their academic fellowship i.e. post residency, who are obtaining an MS or Ph.D, mentored postdoctoral Ph.D. fellows or advanced (third or fourth year) pre-doctoral research students. This aim is achieved by supplementing novice investigators' training with research resources, mentoring and career development opportunities through the New Investigator Scholar (NIS) pathway.  Aim 3 is to enrich training/scientific experiences, promote career opportunities and networking experiences, activities integrated with the Administrative and other CEG cores. The objective is to develop NGBIs and NISs and others new to environmental health science by enriching experiences as an investigator and eventually independent scientist.

"ISMB 2012 Conference Support for Students & Young Scientists     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The 2012 Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in will be held in Long Beach, California, with 1,500-1,700 attendees, including 33-38% students/post doctoral researchers. ISMB brings together graduate students, post doctoral researchers, faculty, research staff and senior scientists of many different nationalities, all of whom are studying or working in computer science, molecular biology, mathematics or statistics. The conference brings biologists and computational scientists together to focus on research centered on actual biological problems rather than simply theoretical calculations. The combined focus on ""intelligent systems"" and actual biological data makes ISMB a highly relevant meeting, and many years of producing the event has resulted in a professionally organized and respected annual conference. The ISMB conference presents the latest research methods and results developed through the application of computer programming to the study of biological sciences, including advances in sequencing genomes that may lead to a better understanding of how, for instance, cells interact for the treatment of diseases such as cancer. Presentations may describe methods and advances associated with the analysis of existing biological literature, including benchmarking experiments, to create a better public understanding of scientific research reports. Overall, ISMB serves to educate attendees on the latest developments that will further drive the research methods and results of the field of computational biology. Students and scientists are able to return to their labs to appy what they have learned as they advance their own research efforts or begin investigating new areas they were exposed to as a result of attending ISMB. The scientific program for each ISMB meeting includes parallel presentation tracks of original research papers, highlights of recently published papers, special sessions focused on emerging topics, technology demos, late breaking research and poster presentations, an art in science exhibition, tutorial workshops, special interest group meetings and a student symposium organized by and for students. For ISMB 2011, 258 original research papers were submitted and 48 selected for the Proceedings Track, while 88 previously published papers were submitted and 38 selected for the Highlights Track. In all, over 225 talks were presented during the course of the 2011 conference, and similar numbers are anticipated for 2012. In all cases, submissions are rigorously reviewed, typically by three members of each track's committee before approval by the track chair, insuring the highest possible quality of work is presented. The specific areas represented in the conference vary each year depending on the areas that researchers find most interesting and innovative, and therefore submit as papers and proposals. This proposal seeks funding to assist students and junior researchers in attending the conference, thus exposing them to the latest research of their own areas as well as areas that may be new to them.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems, largely driven by genomic sequence efforts due to the usefulness of genomic data in the quest to develop new and improved treatments for and prevention of disease is highly dependent on one's ability to electronically access and manipulate it. The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference series directly addresses these questions by showcasing the latest advances in the field and exposing what's on the horizon of future discoveries, but is distinguished from many other events in computational biology or artificial intelligence by an insistence that the researchers work with real molecular biology data, not theoretical or toy examples. Although the cultures of computer science and biology are so disparate, ISMB bridges this cultural gap by providing a forum among biological conferences that features technical advances as they occur, which otherwise may be shunned until a firm experimental result is published.              Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems, largely driven by genomic sequence efforts due to the usefulness of genomic data in the quest to develop new and improved treatments for and prevention of disease is highly dependent on one's ability to electronically access and manipulate it.

"Pattern Discovery for comparative epigenomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a training program that will prepare an effective independent investigator in computational genomics. The candidate has a PhD in biology from the University of Cambridge and will extend his skills in both computational and wet-lab methods through a two-year program of organized mentorship and training, and a structured five-year research program.  This program will promote the command of machine learning as applied to functional genomics data. Dr. William Noble will mentor the candidate's scientific development. Dr. Noble is a recognized leader in computational biology and machine learning. He holds a dual appointment as Associate Professor in Genome Sciences and Com- puter Science and Engineering, and has trained numerous postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Dr. Jeff Bilmes, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, will contribute to the mentoring effort, and a committee of experienced genome and computational biologists will advise on science and the candidate's career goals.  Research will focus on the analysis of multiple tracks of data from high-throughput sequencing assays, such as the ChIP-seq data produced by the ENCODE Project. These experiments allow us to obtain a more complete picture of the structure of human chromatin, revealing the behavior of transcription factors, the organization of epigenetic modifications, and the locations of accessible DNA across the entire genome at up to single-base resolution. A current challenge is to discover joint patterns across multiple tracks of these functional genomics results simultaneously. This project will (1) develop computational methods for identifying such patterns, providing new ways of finding both well-understood genomic features and novel functional elements, (2) apply those methods to characterize the similarities and differences among different biological samples, establishing a better understanding of chromatin, the bounds of its variation, and its role in human disease, and (3) validate computational findings with laboratory experiments. The project will use a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), a type of probabilistic graphical model, to represent the statistical dependencies between observed data, such as sequencing tag density, on an inferred hidden state sequence.  The Department of Genome Sciences of the University Of Washington School Of Medicine provides an ideal setting for training a new independent investigator with an extensive program of formal and informal education for postdoctoral scientists, opportunities for collaboration with researchers with expertise in diverse areas, and modern computational and laboratory resources. This environment maximizes the potential for the candidate to obtain the training and perform the research necessary to establish himself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program.         The major outcome of this work will be a trained scientist with the skills to run an independent research pro- gram integrating computational methods and genome biology. Additionally, the research will result in improved methodology and software resources for analyzing functional genomics data, and a better understanding of how chromatin state affects molecular biology and human disease.

"Research Education in Statistical Genetics of Substance Abuse This application seeks support from the National Institute on Drug Abuse R25 mechanism for pre-doctoral and postdoctoral research positions at the Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics (VIPBG) at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The overall goal of this research education program is to provide an environment that encourages the development and application of statistical genetics at the highest levels. To accomplish this goal, a research education program in statistical genetics will been developed to foster interdisciplinary research, a key tenet of the NIDA mission, and which we believe is essential to conducting research in this field. Two areas of research focus are identified: Advanced Genetic Epidemiology and Statistical Molecular Genetics. These areas are synergistic and address a diverse variety of statistical methods, both those in current use and those under development. The research education program consists of pre-doctoral and postdoctoral components. Pre-doctoral participants will pursue degrees in either Human and Molecular Genetics or Biostatistics. This component is designed to recruit, at the earliest time in their careers, potential future investigators to research in statistical genetics focused on substance use, abuse and dependence (SUAD). The aim is to create a cohort of PhD graduates who are have been extensively exposed to, and begun to publish research in, this area at the outset of their research training. The postdoctoral component recognizes that many promising young researchers have training in areas relevant to, but not focused on, the statistical genetics of substance use and abuse. This flexible 2-3 year postdoctoral training component will help guide young investigators to this field of study and will provide them with integrated and focused training that will enable them to pursue careers in statistical genetics of SUAD. Research education is intended for individuals with training in mathematics, statistics, biostatistics, genetics, psychology or pharmacology and to those who have completed their clinical requirements for the MD degree. The goal of the postdoctoral component is to educate independent investigators who will contribute to the efforts to identify and characterize the genetic and environmental determinants of SUAD; they are expected to do so at VCU and at other institutions nationwide. To accomplish the overall program goal we will: i) Offer and carefully monitor a multidisciplinary integrated research training program with a range of research opportunities; ii) Meet the needs for training in emerging research areas in SUAD; iii) Provide training to researchers from diverse academic and ethnic backgrounds and intensive mentoring; iv) Provide a specialized curriculum that will merge strengths in SUAD research at our institution; and v) Disseminate course materials, developed software, user guides and example scripts to the wider community by teaching workshops and establishing a website with web casts, pod casts and script libraries. This project seeks support from the NIDA R25 research education program in statistical genetics of substance abuse. Two predoctoral and three postdoctoral participants will pursue individualized courses of training in statistical genetics, and participate in active research projects in the Virginia Institute for Psychiatric and Behavioral Genetics at Virginia Commonwealth University.",Research Education in Statistical Genetics of Substance Abuse,8305142,R25DA026119,"['Addictive Behavior', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biometry', 'Clinical', 'Commit', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Education Projects', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Epidemiologist', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetics and Medicine', 'Genome Scan', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'O-(glucuronic acid 2-sulfate)-(1--4)-O-(2,5)-anhydromannitol 6-sulfate', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Pharmacology and Toxicology', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Prevention', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychometrics', 'Publishing', 'Queensland', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Work', 'Writing', 'addiction', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'design', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'human subject', 'medical specialties', 'meetings', 'model development', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'population based', 'post-doctoral training', 'pre-doctoral', 'professor', 'programs', 'psychogenetics', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'web site']",NIDA,VIRGINIA COMMONWEALTH UNIVERSITY,R25,2012,379949,-0.013718399534167917

"Pattern Discovery for comparative epigenomics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a training program that will prepare an effective independent investigator in computational genomics. The candidate has a PhD in biology from the University of Cambridge and will extend his skills in both computational and wet-lab methods through a two-year program of organized mentorship and training, and a structured five-year research program.  This program will promote the command of machine learning as applied to functional genomics data. Dr. William Noble will mentor the candidate's scientific development. Dr. Noble is a recognized leader in computational biology and machine learning. He holds a dual appointment as Associate Professor in Genome Sciences and Com- puter Science and Engineering, and has trained numerous postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Dr. Jeff Bilmes, Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering, will contribute to the mentoring effort, and a committee of experienced genome and computational biologists will advise on science and the candidate's career goals.  Research will focus on the analysis of multiple tracks of data from high-throughput sequencing assays, such as the ChIP-seq data produced by the ENCODE Project. These experiments allow us to obtain a more complete picture of the structure of human chromatin, revealing the behavior of transcription factors, the organization of epigenetic modifications, and the locations of accessible DNA across the entire genome at up to single-base resolution. A current challenge is to discover joint patterns across multiple tracks of these functional genomics results simultaneously. This project will (1) develop computational methods for identifying such patterns, providing new ways of finding both well-understood genomic features and novel functional elements, (2) apply those methods to characterize the similarities and differences among different biological samples, establishing a better understanding of chromatin, the bounds of its variation, and its role in human disease, and (3) validate computational findings with laboratory experiments. The project will use a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN), a type of probabilistic graphical model, to represent the statistical dependencies between observed data, such as sequencing tag density, on an inferred hidden state sequence.  The Department of Genome Sciences of the University Of Washington School Of Medicine provides an ideal setting for training a new independent investigator with an extensive program of formal and informal education for postdoctoral scientists, opportunities for collaboration with researchers with expertise in diverse areas, and modern computational and laboratory resources. This environment maximizes the potential for the candidate to obtain the training and perform the research necessary to establish himself as a skilled investigator with an independent research program.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The major outcome of this work will be a trained scientist with the skills to run an independent research pro- gram integrating computational methods and genome biology. Additionally, the research will result in improved methodology and software resources for analyzing functional genomics data, and a better understanding of how chromatin state affects molecular biology and human disease.              The major outcome of this work will be a trained scientist with the skills to run an independent research pro- gram integrating computational methods and genome biology.

"ISMB 2011 Conference Support for Students & Young Scientists    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ISMB 2011 Conference Travel Support for Students and Young Scientists.  The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference in 2011 will be held in Vienna, Austria, as a conference of approximately 1,500-1,700 attendees, including 33-38% students/post doctoral researchers. ISMB brings together graduate students, post doctoral researchers, faculty, research staff and senior scientists of many different nationalities, all of whom are studying or working in computer science, molecular biology, mathematics and/or statistics. The conference brings biologists and computational scientists together to focus on research centered on actual biological problems rather than simply theoretical calculations. The combined focus on ""intelligent systems"" and actual biological data makes ISMB a highly relevant meeting, and many years of producing the event has resulted in a well organized, well attended, and respected annual conference. The ISMB conference presents the latest research methods and results developed through the application of computer programming to the study of biological sciences, including advances in sequencing genomes that may lead to a better understanding of how, for instance, cells interact for the treatment of diseases such as cancer. Additionally, presentations may describe methods and advances associated with the analysis of existing biological literature, including benchmarking experiments, to create a better public understanding of scientific research reports. Overall, ISMB serves to educate attendees on the latest developments that will further drive the research methods and results of the field of computational biology. Students and scientists are able to return to their labs to apply what they have learned as they advance their own research efforts. The scientific program for each ISMB meeting comprises parallel presentation tracks of original research papers, highlights of recently published research, topically focused special sessions on emerging topics, technology demos, tutorial workshops, special interest group meetings and a student symposium organized by and for students. As an example, for ISMB 2010, 234 original research papers were submitted and 48 selected for the Proceedings Track; 126 published papers were submitted and 42 selected for the Highlights Track; nine proposals were submitted and four selected for presentation along with two invited for the Special Sessions Track. In all, well over 200 talks were presented during the course of the 2010 conference, and similar numbers are anticipated for 2011. In all cases, submissions are rigorously reviewed, typically by three members of each track's committee before approval by the track chair, insuring the highest possible quality of work is presented. The specific areas represented in the conference vary each year depending on the areas that researchers find most interesting and innovative, and therefore submit as papers and proposals. This proposal seeks funding to assist students and junior researchers in attending the conference, thus exposing them to the latest research of their own areas as well as areas that may be new to them.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems. The widespread recognition of bioinformatics has been largely driven by genomic sequence efforts, because laboratory scientists recognize that the usefulness of genomic data in the quest to develop new and improved treatments for and prevention of disease is highly dependent on one's ability to electronically access and manipulate it. Biologists are routinely integrating computational tools into their research programs and creating large predictive models based on information found in databases and other electronic resources. The Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference series directly addresses these questions by showcasing the latest advances in the field, as well as exposing what's on the horizon of future discoveries.           Relevance Bioinformatics is well established as an essential tool for understanding biological systems.

The first cornerstone of this effort is the existing HBP grants held by Dr. Anders Dale (R01 NS39581: Cortical-Surface-Based Brain Imaging) and Dr. David Kennedy (R01 NS34189: Anatomic Morphologic Analysis of MR Brain Images). These efforts span a wealth of technological developments, research and clinical application areas in the rapidly developing area of quantitative morphometric image analysis. A second and vital cornerstone is our association with the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) Biomedical Informatics Program. This existing pre- and post-graduate academic program, within a world class biomedical engineering department, is an ideal setting for the development of a coordinated training effort in Neuroinformatics. The established track record in training skilled scientists in areas of informatics will prove invaluable in this new initiative. The third cornerstone is the combined clinical research opportunities afforded by the Harvard-wide biomedical imaging resources. These include the MGH/MIT/HST Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, the Harvard Neuroimaging Center, the Surgical Planning Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Brain Morphology BIRN (Biomedical Informatics Research Network) and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Together, these active and vibrant programs provide for the best possible training opportunities in imaging science, computer science, clinical application areas, and cognitive neuroscience. A substantial and successful pool of internationally renowned mentors have agreed to participate in this program, and the combined resources provide the best possible exposure to all neuroimaging procedures and insure the capability to draw the highest caliber trainees. A plan for recruiting, selecting and monitoring trainees is proposed. This program will be an asset to the Neuroinformatics initiatives of the Human Brain Project by helping to prepare future scientists with advanced neuroinformatics skills         n/a",Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program,7371085,K12MH069281,"['Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Informatics Research Network', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Activities', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Program Development', 'Psyche structure', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SECTM1 gene', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Woman', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'brain morphology', 'career', 'cationic antimicrobial protein CAP 37', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'imaging informatics', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K12,2008,462488,0.03614045873293554
"Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of this application is to continue our challenge to empower faculty at institutions with high minority enrollment to develop and submit competitive research proposals. Building on our past experience, the competing renewal has three facets which will take place concurrently: 1) up-dating current modules (14) and the development, testing, and evaluation of two new internet course modules; 2) recruitment and training of participants through 5 workshops at remote sites and subsequent participation in the web-based course; 3) continuing evaluation of the training modules for the purpose of technological and content versions. Significant changes from the original program include moving the pre-course conference off-site to maximize the number of faculty participating from contiguous institutions and the introduction of machine language technology to aid in the editing and packaging of participants' grant writing efforts. At the conclusion of the initiative, each participant should be both motivated and empowered to submit a competitive proposal. Thus, our continuing partnership with NIGMS should improve the skills and abilities of researchers/grant writers at minority institutions, increase the number of minorities engaged in biomedical research, and strengthen minority institution's overall research environment. n/a",Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals,7459910,U13GM058252,"['Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects Database', 'Computer software', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grant Review Process', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Progress Reports', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'impression', 'improved', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'skills', 'symposium', 'training project']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,U13,2008,118789,0.029277323485923892

"MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Within the three short years since the University of Kansas (KU) IMSD program began, twelve minority students, including six American Indians, will have applied to graduate school. This is a continuation proposal to allow us to build on these successes. KU IMSD works in concert with other NIH funded programs (Bridge, RISE, IRACDA) and takes full advantage of the juxtaposition of a Research I Institution (KU) and one of the largest tribal colleges (Haskell Indian Nations University). KU IMSD consists of four components: 1) providing research experiences to American Indian and other minority students, with a particular a focus on recruiting Haskell students from the Bridge or RISE program; 2) enhancing and modifying the curriculum; 3) offering an interdisciplinary seminar series and 4) providing financial aid and mentoring. The undergraduate research experience takes a broad, interdisciplinary approach to placing students into one of 77 possible KU labs and includes opportunities for students to share their research results at local and national meetings. The program will also support several American Indian graduate students who have obtained BA's from Haskell. IMSD supported curricular enhancements that have shown remarkable results over the past three years will be continued for gatekeeper courses in biology, chemistry and math. In biology alone, the average grade point average of American Indian students who completed the introductory biology course has increased from 0.86 to 2.94 over the past six years. An integrative seminar series will bring together students from the IMSD, Bridge, and RISE programs to foster community and learning. Support from KU IMSD for undergraduate researchers will be a cornerstone in providing financial support along with KU scholarships targeted for American Indian students. Mentoring will be provided from faculty (research advisors), the IMSD Program Coordinator (individual and group meetings) and peers (other IMSD students). Evaluation and tracking procedures will allow for regular adjustment of activities during the course of the program and assessment of whether goals have been met. If funded for another four years, the KU/Haskell collaboration provides the opportunity to significantly impact the number of American Indian scientists in this country.         n/a",MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas,7389728,R25GM062232,"['Address', 'Administrative Personnel', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alaska', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biodiversity', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Budgets', 'Calculi', 'Cells', 'Chaos Theory', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conservatism', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Structure', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Fees', 'Film', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GYPA gene', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Glycophorin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Habits', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Humanities', 'Indigenous', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Invasive', 'Journals', 'Judgment', 'Kansas', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modems', 'Modification', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Museums', 'Music', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural History', 'Newsletter', 'Numbers', 'Oklahoma', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Other Minority', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Placement', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Poverty', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Development', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Published Comment', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Rewards', 'Schedule', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Snow', 'Social Functioning', 'Source', 'Sports', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Today', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Wages', 'Week', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'aging nutrition', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer generated', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'court', 'data acquisition', 'day', 'digital', 'ear helix', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'gene therapy', 'high school', 'i(19)', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'lectures', 'member', 'novel', 'peer', 'posters', 'preference', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'role model', 'satisfaction', 'size', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'tribal college']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R25,2008,373102,0.0951081987875466

The third cornerstone is the combined clinical research opportunities afforded by the Harvard-wide biomedical imaging resources. These include the MGH/MIT/HST Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, the Harvard Neuroimaging Center, the Surgical Planning Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Brain Morphology BIRN (Biomedical Informatics Research Network) and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Together, these active and vibrant programs provide for the best possible training opportunities in imaging science, computer science, clinical application areas, and cognitive neuroscience. A substantial and successful pool of internationally renowned mentors have agreed to participate in this program, and the combined resources provide the best possible exposure to all neuroimaging procedures and insure the capability to draw the highest caliber trainees. A plan for recruiting, selecting and monitoring trainees is proposed. This program will be an asset to the Neuroinformatics initiatives of the Human Brain Project by helping to prepare future scientists with advanced neuroinformatics skills         n/a",Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program,7189144,K12MH069281,"['Anatomy', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Informatics Research Network', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Caliber', 'Class', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Educational Activities', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Monitor', 'Neurosciences', 'Numbers', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Physicians', 'Procedures', 'Program Development', 'Psyche structure', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'SECTM1 gene', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Woman', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biomedical informatics', 'brain morphology', 'career', 'cationic antimicrobial protein CAP 37', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computer science', 'imaging informatics', 'multidisciplinary', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSP,K12,2007,450967,0.03614045873293554
"Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall objective of this application is to continue our challenge to empower faculty at institutions with high minority enrollment to develop and submit competitive research proposals. Building on our past experience, the competing renewal has three facets which will take place concurrently: 1) up-dating current modules (14) and the development, testing, and evaluation of two new internet course modules; 2) recruitment and training of participants through 5 workshops at remote sites and subsequent participation in the web-based course; 3) continuing evaluation of the training modules for the purpose of technological and content versions. Significant changes from the original program include moving the pre-course conference off-site to maximize the number of faculty participating from contiguous institutions and the introduction of machine language technology to aid in the editing and packaging of participants' grant writing efforts. At the conclusion of the initiative, each participant should be both motivated and empowered to submit a competitive proposal. Thus, our continuing partnership with NIGMS should improve the skills and abilities of researchers/grant writers at minority institutions, increase the number of minorities engaged in biomedical research, and strengthen minority institution's overall research environment. n/a",Interactive Learning Modules for Writing Grant Proposals,7252088,U13GM058252,"['Advisory Committees', 'Applications Grants', 'Biomedical Research', 'Computer Retrieval of Information on Scientific Projects Database', 'Computer software', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Educational workshop', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Grant Review Process', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Participant', 'Peer Review', 'Progress Reports', 'Purpose', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Site', 'Study Section', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'impression', 'improved', 'member', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'skills', 'symposium', 'training project']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,U13,2007,276104,0.029277323485923892

"MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Within the three short years since the University of Kansas (KU) IMSD program began, twelve minority students, including six American Indians, will have applied to graduate school. This is a continuation proposal to allow us to build on these successes. KU IMSD works in concert with other NIH funded programs (Bridge, RISE, IRACDA) and takes full advantage of the juxtaposition of a Research I Institution (KU) and one of the largest tribal colleges (Haskell Indian Nations University). KU IMSD consists of four components: 1) providing research experiences to American Indian and other minority students, with a particular a focus on recruiting Haskell students from the Bridge or RISE program; 2) enhancing and modifying the curriculum; 3) offering an interdisciplinary seminar series and 4) providing financial aid and mentoring. The undergraduate research experience takes a broad, interdisciplinary approach to placing students into one of 77 possible KU labs and includes opportunities for students to share their research results at local and national meetings. The program will also support several American Indian graduate students who have obtained BA's from Haskell. IMSD supported curricular enhancements that have shown remarkable results over the past three years will be continued for gatekeeper courses in biology, chemistry and math. In biology alone, the average grade point average of American Indian students who completed the introductory biology course has increased from 0.86 to 2.94 over the past six years. An integrative seminar series will bring together students from the IMSD, Bridge, and RISE programs to foster community and learning. Support from KU IMSD for undergraduate researchers will be a cornerstone in providing financial support along with KU scholarships targeted for American Indian students. Mentoring will be provided from faculty (research advisors), the IMSD Program Coordinator (individual and group meetings) and peers (other IMSD students). Evaluation and tracking procedures will allow for regular adjustment of activities during the course of the program and assessment of whether goals have been met. If funded for another four years, the KU/Haskell collaboration provides the opportunity to significantly impact the number of American Indian scientists in this country.         n/a",MBRS IMSD Program at the University of Kansas,7209749,R25GM062232,"['Address', 'Administrative Personnel', 'Administrator', 'Adopted', 'Advertising', 'Alaska', 'Algorithms', 'American Indians', 'Appendix', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Attention', 'Authorization documentation', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biodiversity', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Books', 'Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy', 'Budgets', 'Calculi', 'Cells', 'Chaos Theory', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Cities', 'Class', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Conservatism', 'Country', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Structure', 'Daily', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethics', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Feeling', 'Fees', 'Film', 'Financial Support', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GYPA gene', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gene Structure', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Programming', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Glycophorin A', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Group Meetings', 'Growth', 'Habits', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Heart', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Home environment', 'Hour', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Humanities', 'Indigenous', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Systems', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Internships', 'Invasive', 'Journals', 'Judgment', 'Kansas', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Modems', 'Modification', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular and Cellular Biology', 'Monitor', 'Motivation', 'Museums', 'Music', 'Mutation', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Natural History', 'Newsletter', 'Numbers', 'Oklahoma', 'Oral', 'Oral cavity', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Other Minority', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Paper', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Placement', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Poverty', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Problem Solving', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Program Development', 'Progress Reports', 'Proteins', 'Published Comment', 'Purpose', 'Qualifying', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Recommendation', 'Records', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Rewards', 'Schedule', 'Scholarship', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Selection Criteria', 'Series', 'Services', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Snow', 'Social Functioning', 'Source', 'Sports', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Support Groups', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Time Management', 'Today', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visit', 'Visualization software', 'Wages', 'Week', 'Work', 'Writing', 'abstracting', 'aging nutrition', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer generated', 'computer science', 'concept', 'cost', 'court', 'data acquisition', 'day', 'digital', 'ear helix', 'expectation', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'gene therapy', 'high school', 'i(19)', 'image visualization', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'lectures', 'member', 'novel', 'peer', 'posters', 'preference', 'professor', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'role model', 'satisfaction', 'size', 'skills', 'success', 'symposium', 'theories', 'tool', 'tribal college']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R25,2007,430160,0.0951081987875466
"REU in Functional Genomics and Cell Biology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to establish a summer program for undergraduates with non-biological sciences backgrounds that will provide cross-discipline training and experiences in combining the physical sciences backgrounds of the participants with concepts and approaches of functional genomics and cell biology to address biomedical research problems. The intended impact of our program is to encourage participating students to pursue graduate education in biomedical sciences, followed by careers in biomedical research.       Six students will be selected each year to pursue 10-week research experiences in one of eleven laboratories at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Instruction in functional genomics and cell biology will be provided through workshops and a series of seminars. Students will work as a group on a cross-discipline case study in wound-healing. In addition, students will receive instruction in research ethics, scientific writing, and career opportunities in biomedical sciences. At the conclusion of the summer, students will present their work at a poster session and receive evaluations. Students will be encouraged to publish their results in the Journal of the Ohio Association of Science.  To build community among these students, they will participate in a series of social and cultural events.   Formative evaluations will be used to alter and fine-tune the Program, and summative evaluations will be carried out at the conclusion of each summer and again, as the participants graduate from their undergraduate institutions, to measure the long-term impact of the Program on the participating students. n/a",REU in Functional Genomics and Cell Biology,7226706,R25GM072834,"['Academia', 'Academy',

"Computational Approaches to Disease Causes and Treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The State University of New York at Buffalo has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators to plan and establish a National Program of Excellence in Biomedical Computing. The overall theme of the center is ""Novel Data Mining Algorithms for Applications in Genomics"" with a focus on the development of novel techniques for storing, managing, analyzing, modeling and visualizing multi-dimensional data sets. We intend to provide the expertise and infrastructure that will merge the research activities of computational and biomedical scientists. The focus of the proposed research is the study of common diseases, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and coronary artery disease in which the underlying causes are multi-factorial. In this new paradigm, we will use advanced computational techniques and approaches to convert raw genomic data into knowledge that will advance the understanding of these common diseases and potentially identify new modalities of treatment. The Center will play a critical role in fostering multidisciplinary collaborations between faculty from the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering, Biology, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Science and various departments in the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. By co-locating biomedical and computer scientists, common understanding of research approaches will result in the development of computational tools that will meet the real-life needs of the biomedical researchers to help advance their projects. The Center will provide a broad range of educational and training activities for individuals who wish to pursue a career focusing on computational biology and bioinformatics. The focus of the education program will be the interdisciplinary training of computer science and engineering students who wish to pursue research in functional genomics and other biomedical areas, and the cross training of biomedically oriented students in topics with more of a computing orientation. We have identified three development projects that provide unique scientific opportunities to integrate the expertise of mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists with medical scientists, and to investigate novel computational approaches. These computational related projects are: 1. Data integration and data mining of clinical data and genomic data to advance clinical and epidemiological genetics as well as drug effect studies; 2. Pharmacodynamic analysis of drug-responsive gene expression changes; and 3. Chemi-genetic approaches to mapping regulatory pathways. These research projects will be supported by three core resources: genomics core, computational core, and clinical core. The common nature of these applications is that they all generate multidimensional data sets with numerical, functional or symbolic attributes. The management, retrieval and visualization of these data sets and analyses is likely to prove to be a rate limiting factor for new biomedical discoveries and the development of techniques for the effective analyses of genomic datasets is a critical step for the medical applications of bioinformatics. n/a",Computational Approaches to Disease Causes and Treatment,6931476,P20GM067650,"['animal tissue', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'computational biology', 'computer data analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'data management', 'disease /disorder etiology', 'epidemiology', 'functional /structural genomics', 'gene expression', 'human subject', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'mathematical model', 'pharmacokinetics', 'science education', 'statistics /biometry', 'technology /technique development', 'therapy', 'training']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,P20,2005,392500,0.02565349969899541
"Middle School Life Science-Education Partnership-PhaseII    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Precollege science education, particularly middle school where students first encounter courses dedicated to the sciences, has lacked the attention of the scientific and education communities. As a result, many middle level teachers are marginally prepared to teach contemporary science, the development of effective curricular materials has lagged, and schools devote inadequate resources and support to science. In the prior Phase I grant, experiment modules have been designed by scientists that address the core content of middle school Life Science. They utilize live (aquatic) organisms in the class room to stimulate inquiry into the properties of living organisms and make connections with related environmental health problems to link student learning with the world around them. Human environmental health was chosen as the biomedical context because it strongly relates to the macroscopic world in which middle school students live and provides age-appropriate learning opportunities for students as they begin to understand organisms and their underlying structures and mechanisms. During Phase II our specific objectives are 1. To infuse middle school Life Science education with attractive experiment modules that stress student inquiry. 2. To mount a comprehensive dissemination program with school systems that work with large numbers of minorities and students from families with lower socioeconomic status. 3. To utilize a 'train the trainer' method for lead teachers to achieve wide dissemination of the modules that involves close collaboration between scientists and educators and the lead teachers. 4. To provide teachers with full support to implement and sustain the modules through a science resource center. 5. To continue the development of the content of the modules. 6. To obtain a thorough formative and summative evaluation of the effectiveness of the curriculum modules and the entire mechanism for their delivery. 7. To establish a robust program to sustain the module dissemination to teachers after the completion of the grant.         n/a",Middle School Life Science-Education Partnership-PhaseII,6857683,R25RR014267,"['DVD /CD ROM', 'artificial intelligence', 'curriculum', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'ethnic group', 'female', 'learning', 'meeting /conference /symposium', 'minority health professional', 'science education', 'secondary schools', 'social support network', 'teacher', 'university student', 'videotape /videodisc']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MILWAUKEE,R25,2005,268813,0.08071966408426008

"LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stottler Henke Associates in collaboration with Teachers College, Columbia University, proposes to build a software system for teaching scientific inquiry in the context of nutrition science, The goal of the proposed research is to develop a computer based instructional system - called LiFESim - that teaches accurate and detailed information about food and the food system -- from production of food on the farm through food processing and transportation, to impacts of food on personal health and on the natural environment in terms of waste and pollution. The software will complement an existing health science curriculum, developed at Teachers College for 4th-6th graders, called ""Linking Food and the Environment"" or LIFE, developed from an NIH Science Education Partnership Award (SEPA) RR 12374 (1997-2004). Our system will be based on the paradigm of role-playing simulation used in such popular computer games as SimCity and The Sims: students using the software assume roles in a simulated environment and learn from the consequences of the decisions that they make in those roles. Using the simulation paradigm students will be able to explore the dynamics of large-scale systems, such as those the food transportation system in ways that are not possible with the existing curriculum. For example, the simulation would allow students to explore the impact of changes in transportation patterns on food delivery. Our system will provide explicit coaching in applying scientific methods for investigation. We will also explore learning strategies that will encourage students to critically examine - and hopefully improve - their dietary choices. We will complement simulation-based learning with two other artificial intelligence based methodologies - the use of lifelike pedagogical agents, and the use of case-based reasoning. During Phase I, we will develop a set of detailed instructional goals, use these to develop an initial system design, develop a limited prototype of the system, and then develop and perform an informal pilot study to evaluate the viability of our design. The pilot study will be conducted over a one-month period at schools in Hayward, California and New York City. Our Phase II effort will focus on developing an extensive design and performing detailed use testing of the system developed during Phase I.         n/a",LiFESim: Software for health science education (NCRR),6790401,R43RR019780,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted instruction', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'education evaluation /planning', 'educational resource design /development', 'environmental contamination', 'food', 'food processing /preparation', 'health education', 'human subject', 'interactive multimedia', 'nutrition', 'nutrition related tag', 'science education']",NCRR,"STOTTLER HENKE ASSOCIATES, INC.",R43,2004,100000,0.012370006384590473
"AI Software for Science Education Related to Drug Abuse DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase I SBIR proposal is aimed at advancing the state of the art in chemistry education software in a critically important respect demanded by students, teachers, administrators and Quantum Simulations, Inc. customers. The focus of this innovation is the development of meaningful interactive tutoring and assessment capabilities for chemistry problem solving. Empowerment of students to make the proper decisions about drugs through experiencing the scientific process requires a solid education in basic chemistry. Chemical formulas comprise much of the fundamental ""language"" of chemistry in which students must be fluent in order to succeed. The topic of writing and understanding chemical formulas, a cornerstone of all general chemistry classes, is a reasonable starting point for the development of an AI assessment system for student learning in chemistry. A solid understanding of chemical formulas is a prerequisite to success in chemistry required not only for literacy to make informed decisions about drugs from a scientific standpoint, but also to enable and prepare students to pursue careers in research related to drug abuse. Quantum has already successfully developed and commercialized an ITS for writing chemical formulas which will be used as the starting point for the present work. The proposed technology will benefit all students; however, it is specifically targeted to help those who have the greatest need, such as students of average or marginal performance and students from historically underserved groups, by lowering barriers to accessing high-quality science instructional software.  Quantum customers include textbook publishers, software providers, hardware vendors and distance learning companies. A prominent textbook publisher, Holt, Rinehart and Winston, has entered into two long-term contracts with Quantum, resulting in rapid dissemination to an established end user base. Quantum intends to employ an identical business model to commercialize the results of this project. n/a",AI Software for Science Education Related to Drug Abuse,6831228,R43DA018455,"['adolescence (12-20)', 'artificial intelligence', 'clinical research', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'drug abuse education', 'educational resource design /development', 'human subject', 'science education']",NIDA,"QUANTUM SIMULATIONS, INC.",R43,2004,61750,0.03411356327483772

Our proposed Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program (NNTP) is based upon a number of important strategic alliances. The first cornerstone of this effort is the existing HBP grants held by Dr. Anders Dale (R01 NS39581: Cortical-Surface-Based Brain Imaging) and Dr. David Kennedy (R01 NS34189: Anatomic Morphologic Analysis of MR Brain Images). These efforts span a wealth of technological developments, research and clinical application areas in the rapidly developing area of quantitative morphometric image analysis. A second and vital cornerstone is our association with the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) Biomedical Informatics Program. This existing pre- and post-graduate academic program, within a world class biomedical engineering department, is an ideal setting for the development of a coordinated training effort in Neuroinformatics. The established track record in training skilled scientists in areas of informatics will prove invaluable in this new initiative. The third cornerstone is the combined clinical research opportunities afforded by the Harvard-wide biomedical imaging resources. These include the MGH/MIT/HST Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, the Harvard Neuroimaging Center, the Surgical Planning Lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital, the Brain Morphology BIRN (Biomedical Informatics Research Network) and the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Together, these active and vibrant programs provide for the best possible training opportunities in imaging science, computer science, clinical application areas, and cognitive neuroscience. A substantial and successful pool of internationally renowned mentors have agreed to participate in this program, and the combined resources provide the best possible exposure to all neuroimaging procedures and insure the capability to draw the highest caliber trainees. A plan for recruiting, selecting and monitoring trainees is proposed. This program will be an asset to the Neuroinformatics initiatives of the Human Brain Project by helping to prepare future scientists with advanced neuroinformatics skills         n/a",Neuroimaging Neuroinformatics Training Program,6700018,K12MH069281,"['bioimaging /biomedical imaging', 'bioinformatics', 'brain imaging /visualization /scanning', 'brain morphology', 'career', 'image processing', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'neurosciences', 'training']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K12,2004,311472,0.03614045873293554
"Computational Approaches to Disease Causes and Treatment DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The State University of New York at Buffalo has assembled a multi-disciplinary team of investigators to plan and establish a National Program of Excellence in Biomedical Computing. The overall theme of the center is ""Novel Data Mining Algorithms for Applications in Genomics"" with a focus on the development of novel techniques for storing, managing, analyzing, modeling and visualizing multi-dimensional data sets. We intend to provide the expertise and infrastructure that will merge the research activities of computational and biomedical scientists. The focus of the proposed research is the study of common diseases, such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and coronary artery disease in which the underlying causes are multi-factorial. In this new paradigm, we will use advanced computational techniques and approaches to convert raw genomic data into knowledge that will advance the understanding of these common diseases and potentially identify new modalities of treatment. The Center will play a critical role in fostering multidisciplinary collaborations between faculty from the Departments of Computer Science and Engineering, Biology, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical Science and various departments in the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences. By co-locating biomedical and computer scientists, common understanding of research approaches will result in the development of computational tools that will meet the real-life needs of the biomedical researchers to help advance their projects. The Center will provide a broad range of educational and training activities for individuals who wish to pursue a career focusing on computational biology and bioinformatics. The focus of the education program will be the interdisciplinary training of computer science and engineering students who wish to pursue research in functional genomics and other biomedical areas, and the cross training of biomedically oriented students in topics with more of a computing orientation. We have identified three development projects that provide unique scientific opportunities to integrate the expertise of mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists with medical scientists, and to investigate novel computational approaches. These computational related projects are: 1. Data integration and data mining of clinical data and genomic data to advance clinical and epidemiological genetics as well as drug effect studies; 2. Pharmacodynamic analysis of drug-responsive gene expression changes; and 3. Chemi-genetic approaches to mapping regulatory pathways. These research projects will be supported by three core resources: genomics core, computational core, and clinical core. The common nature of these applications is that they all generate multidimensional data sets with numerical, functional or symbolic attributes. The management, retrieval and visualization of these data sets and analyses is likely to prove to be a rate limiting factor for new biomedical discoveries and the development of techniques for the effective analyses of genomic datasets is a critical step for the medical applications of bioinformatics. n/a",Computational Approaches to Disease Causes and Treatment,6690235,P20GM067650,"['animal tissue', ' artificial intelligence', ' computer data analysis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' disease /disorder etiology', ' epidemiology', ' functional /structural genomics', ' gene expression', ' human subject', ' informatics', ' interdisciplinary collaboration', ' mathematical model', ' pharmacokinetics', ' science education', ' statistics /biometry', ' technology /technique development', ' therapy', ' training']",NIGMS,STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK AT BUFFALO,P20,2003,392500,0.02565349969899541

"Educational Tools for Neuroscience   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SHAI proposes to bring two instructional        technologies together to compliment neuroscience lectures and distance               learning. Specifically we want to embed Computer Simulations of experiments and      the chemical, genetic, and physiological systems that underlie them within an        Intelligent Tutoring System. Simulations are excellent tools for revealing the       structure and dynamics of systems to students. They can also serve as a basis        of interactive experiments where students can ""discover"" the answers to              questions. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are an emerging educational            technology based on artificial intelligence research. They play the role of          tutor, in that they guide students with appropriate information or                   demonstrations when they are having difficulty with a lesson. They also              adaptively plan the presentation of new lessons based on evaluations of a            student's past performance and knowledge level. The objective of this phase I        proposal is to develop a prototype of NeuroTutor, a simulation-based ITS to          provide students with individualized instruction in a simulation centered            environment. Steps to reaching this objective include designing a curriculum,        developing instructional, presentations and support, developing appropriate          methods for Student Modeling and Diagnosis, and implementing a limited               prototype.

"Developing Machine Learning-Driven Prediction Models and Therapeutic Strategies for Circulatory Shock in Critically-ill Patients K23 Abstract This application is for a K23 Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award entitled “Developing Machine Learning-Driven Prediction Models and Therapeutic Strategies for Circulatory Shock in Critically-ill Patients”. I am a pulmonary and critical care physician at the University of Pittsburgh. This award will facilitate my acquisition of advanced training in clinical research methods, clinical informatics, and computer science to develop my career as a physician-scientist focused on data-driven studies of dynamic physiology in critically-ill patients. The main objective of this proposal is to develop individualized prediction models and treatment strategies for shock among critically-ill patients. The aims of this study are: 1) To build machine learning-based prediction models of tachycardia and hypotension following blood donation using non-invasive waveform data in healthy blood donor volunteers, and create baseline features to compare with circulatory shock 2) To provide an operational definition, prediction models, differentiation of physiologic evolution towards shock, and personalized treatment of circulatory shock in ICU patients. Through this proposal, I will develop advanced skills in machine-learning, clinical bioinformatics, and clinical research. I will complete a Master of Science in Biomedical Informatics to learn advanced data- driven research methodologies to strengthen my technical training. This award will be a critical step towards my long-term goal, being an independent physician scientist, with expertise in prediction analytics in critical care medicine through clinical trials. I have committed mentors Dr. Michael Pinsky (physiology, functional hemodynamics) and Dr. Gilles Clermont (critical care, algorithms, data science) who will ensure successful completion of my proposed aims. My mentoring committee also includes an advisor, Dr. Milos Hauskrecht - a renowned computer scientist in the Computer Science and Information Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. My work will be completed within the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy, and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, which has an extensive track record of committing to the development of physician scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE Circulatory shock is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among critically ill patients. Early identification or forecasting of shock would be clinically actionable and improve prognosis, but no personalized prediction model for shock has been presented yet.

"Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning Abstract Andrew Holbrook, Ph.D., is a Bayesian statistician with a broad background in applied, theoretical and compu- tational data science. His proposed research Big Data Predictive Phylogenetics with Bayesian Learning tackles viral outbreak forecasting by combining Bayesian phylogenetic modeling with ﬂexible, `self-exciting' stochastic process models. The development and publication of open-source, high-performance computing software for his models will facilitate fast epidemiological ﬁeld response in a big data setting. Dr. Holbrook will apply his method- ology to the reconstruction of the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic in the Americas, focusing on identifying key geographical routes of transmission and phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness.  Candidate: Dr. Holbrook is Postdoctoral Scholar at the UCLA Department of Human Genetics. He earned his Ph.D. in Statistics from the Department of Statistics at UC Irvine, during which time he completed his dissertation Geometric Bayes, an investigation into Bayesian modeling and computing on abstract mathematical spaces, and simultaneously participated in scientiﬁc collaborations at the UC Irvine Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. The proposed career development plan will establish Dr. Holbrook as an independent leader in data intensive viral epidemiology by 1) facilitating coursework to build biological domain knowledge, 2) affording Dr. Holbrook the opportunity to lead his own project while remaining under the expert oversight of UCLA Prof. Marc Suchard, M.D., Ph.D., and 3) allowing Dr. Holbrook to continue his focus on quantitative viral epidemiology once he has moved to a faculty commitment.  Mentors: During the ﬁrst three years of the award period, Dr. Holbrook will work closely with Prof. Suchard, continuing their current schedule of weekly meetings. Prof. Suchard is a leading expert in both Bayesian phylo- genetics and high-performance statistical computing; and with his medical background, Prof. Suchard will advise Dr. Holbrook in his expansion of domain knowledge in viral epidemiology. As secondary mentor, Prof. Kristian Andersen, Ph.D., of the Scripps Institute will advise Dr. Holbrook in the impactful application of his statistical and computational methodologies to the 2015-2016 Zika virus epidemic. Dr. Holbrook and Profs. Suchard and Andersen will maintain their collaborations after the postdoctoral period.  Research: Bayesian phylogenetics successfully reconstructs evolutionary histories but fails to predict viral spread. Self-exciting point processes are devoid of biological insight and fail to account for geographic networks of diffusion. Aim 1 addresses deﬁciencies in these two complementary viral epidemiological modeling techniques by innovating a combined model where the phylogenetic and self-excitatory components support each other. Aim 2 makes widespread adoption a reality by publishing open-source, massively parallel computing software suitable for big data analysis. Aim 3 reconstructs the 2015-2016 Zika epidemic, learns key geographical routes of transmission and identiﬁes phylogenetic clades with enhanced infectiousness. Project Narrative Tracking and predicting viral outbreaks remains an open epidemiological problem with deadly consequences. Dr. Holbrook will attack the problem with his Bayesian phylogenetic Hawkes processes, a class of models tailored to simultaneously reconstruct evolutionary histories and predict viral diffusion dynamics. With the mentorship of Profs.

The program will be hosted by the Center for Neural Science (CNS), with participation of faculty in the Departments of Psychology, Mathematics, and Computer Science, and the Institute of Neuroscience at the School of Medicine. The TPCN will fit well with NYU’s unique strengths and recent developments: (1) NYU is one of a few universities with a critical mass of computational neuroscientists. NYU has had a Sloan-Swartz Center for Theoretical Neuroscience since 1994. In the past three years alone, NYU has hired three computational neuroscientists. (2) CNS established an undergraduate major in neuroscience as early as 1992, and thus has a long track record in undergraduate education, it now has 136 students in the current academic year. (3) Recent faculty hiring in CNS, Psychology, and the School of Medicine has greatly expanded our teaching and research capabilities in the neuroscience of cognitive functions and their impairments associated with mental disorders. (3) As NYU is undertaking a merge of two historically separated neuroscience graduate programs (at CNS and the School of Medicine), this training grant will ensure that computational modeling, which has become indispensible in neuroscience, will be front-and-center in the integrated graduate program. (4) NYU is a major center of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with close links to Facebook’s AI Center and the Simons Center for Data Analysis. Our training faculty together with these connections will give our students ample opportunities to acquire machine learning techniques for data analysis and learn about brain-like AI algorithms. The proposed training program will support coherent undergraduate and graduate training in computational neuroscience at NYU. It will have several unique features: (1) Innovative mentorship methods: For example, (a) graduate trainees will mentor undergraduate trainees, (b) faculty will explicitly discuss human factors in academic practice; (c) there will be post-mortems after seminars by outside speakers. (2) Computational psychiatry: We propose new courses and research opportunities that are designed specifically to link cognitive function and the neurobiology of neural circuits. We propose innovative education in the nascent field of Computational Psychiatry, to bring theory and circuit modeling to clinical research in mental health. (3) Broad preparation: We aim to prepare trainees for jobs not only in academia, but also in medical and industry research. To achieve this, we will utilize our strength in machine learning and data science to broaden computational neuroscience training. The Program Directors have complementary strengths and will have complementary roles in the program. Wang will supervise graduate trainees and focus on training in mechanistic/circuit-level side of computational neuroscience as well as computational psychiatry. Ma will supervise undergraduate trainees and focus on the computational/behavioral side. This grant will support training of a new generation of graduate and undergraduate students in  computational neuroscience, which has become increasingly important to meet the challenges of  making discoveries with new data analysis tools and of understanding highly nonlinear complex  neural circuits. A salient component of our program is training in the nascent field  of   Computational  Psychiatry,  bridging  basic  neuroscience  and clinical research on mental  disorders. Therefore, the proposed program has the potential of making  a significant impact on  mental health.",Training a new generation of computational neuroscientists bridging neurobiology,10002209,R90DA043849,"['Academia', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Ensure', 'Facebook', 'Faculty', 'Generations', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Industry', 'Institutes', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'New York', 'Occupations', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Role', 'Science', 'Side', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer science', 'design', 'innovation', 'mathematical sciences', 'medical schools', 'neural circuit', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R90,2020,100690,0.05101702304936782
"Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium ABSTRACT This proposal seeks funding to support a symposium, Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology (ABI), which will bring together recognized world experts in clinical, research, vision science, engineering, industrial and pharmaceutical communities as well as junior investigators (i.e., young faculty and those in training) to discuss the current state of ABI, ranging from bioelectronic implantable and wearable devices, to nanoscale scaffolds for stem cell and gene therapies. Given the multidisciplinary nature of this field, it is essential to bring together researchers and clinicians with varying levels of expertise across many domains related to ABI to advance the progress of this novel field, identify challenges of advancement, and develop a strategic action plan to overcome these challenges. The timing to have such a symposium to further the application of implantable and/or wearable bioengineered systems in ophthalmology is now as we focus on precision and personalized medicine and leverage the revolution in deep learning artificial intelligence algorithms. Through symposium talks, sessions, and discussions we will cover the fundamentals and also identify innovative and cutting-edge strategies and methodologies to accelerate the rate of major discoveries and development of novel therapeutics. The specific aims of this symposium are: Specific Aim 1. To bring together both established and junior investigators representing a broad range of disciplines to discuss cutting edge research in this novel field, catalyze the development of cross-disciplinary and translational approaches to advance abiotic-biotic interfaces for ophthalmology, and identify gaps in knowledge and barriers to advancement. We will identify research questions and develop an agenda to guide future research that is consistent with the objectives and interests of NEI. Specific Aim 2. Develop a junior investigator program to motivate a diverse group of students and junior investigators to pursue research careers in vision science and ophthalmologic therapeutic development, who will ultimately submit grant proposals to NEI solicitations and contribute to the scientific literature. Specific Aim 3. Develop a strategic action plan to set priorities for future studies that will encourage inter-agency collaborations (e.g., NEI, NSF, DARPA, etc.). This is critical because often certain engineering tasks are best suited to be supported by NSF or DARPA whereas the biological testing of the engineered systems lends itself to funding from NEI. Hence such inter-agency or cross-agency efforts can help leverage the funding to develop sophisticated abiotic-biotic systems NARRATIVE This meeting is the first on this topic dedicated to the broad use of implantable and/or wearable bioelectronics for ophthalmological applications. It is anticipated that the strategic action plan will significantly impact the field by greatly accelerating the translation of basic science and engineering research findings to stimulate the development of novel treatments and improve clinical practice. Key topics include visual restoration, drug and gene delivery, and sensing intraocular pressure. This meeting will foster training and development of future leaders in this emerging field and promote collaboration and exchange of knowledge and ideas among junior and established investigators.",Abiotic-Biotic Interfaces for Ophthalmology Symposium,10070800,R13EY031988,"['Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Testing', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Contact Lenses', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electronics', 'Engineering', 'Eye', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Delivery', 'Glass', 'Industrialization', 'Intraocular lens implant device', 'Knowledge', 'Literature', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Nature', 'Neural Retina', 'Ophthalmology', 'Optics', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Physiological', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Route', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Senior Scientist', 'Students', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Virtual and Augmented reality', 'Visual', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'gene therapy', 'implantable device', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'meetings', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanoscale', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'personalized medicine', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'programs', 'restoration', 'scaffold', 'stem cell therapy', 'symposium', 'therapeutic development', 'translational approach', 'vision science', 'wearable device']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R13,2020,42465,0.02964482588317363
"ORS-ISFR 17th Biennial Conference: Thinking big on fracture repair Abstract Bone fractures occur in more than 25 million Americans per year, and a significant percentage of those fractures fail to heal. Fractures that show delayed or failed progression to heal account for the majority of patient disability and costs. Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand the biology of bone healing, and to use that knowledge to develop new diagnostics and therapeutics. We are seeking support for the 17th Biennial conference of the International Section of Fracture Repair (ISFR). The ISFR recently became incorporated as a section within the Orthopaedic Research Society (ORS) thereby leveraging the outreach of the largest scientific organization in the world dedicated to orthopaedic research. The ISFR is dedicated to the advancement and exchange of the most current scientific ideas and research findings on fracture repair and its application to the improvement of patient care. Our mission is be the premier forum to integrate and present cutting-edge ideas related to clinical, translational, and basic science research of fracture healing. The central theme for this conference is “Thinking Big”. We will present the use of -omics approaches to solve the most significant research problems in the field and large-scale data management and advanced computational approaches to solve intractable clinical concerns. The meeting is organized around seven scientific sessions, and also includes an embedded symposium conducted with the Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) focused on non-unions and a collaborative session on proximal humeral fractures conducted with the Bone and Joint Institute of the University of Western Ontario (BJI). The scientific sessions will each have a series of speakers, selected from submitted abstracts, and each will have an eminent keynote invited speaker. The sessions include: Stem Cells in Fracture; Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Big data; Fracture induced pain management; Fracture repair basic research; Fracture repair clinical perspectives; Bone repair with polytrauma; and Outcomes. There will also be a short session for poster oral presentations (poster teasers), a session on how to communicate science, a practicum on data management, and an ORS Presidential Guest Speaker. Following the ISFR 17th biennial conference there will be an associated ISFR/BJI consensus workshop, which will develop a consensus white-paper on the best evidence-based treatment for proximal humeral fractures. The meeting will present the most up to date research on fracture healing basic biology, translational research and prospective clinical studies. The Program and Scientific Committees will be highly focused on fostering an inclusive environment. Surgeons, biologists, engineers, and policy makers will attend the meeting, and be drawn from academia, government, and industry. A variety of activities will be focused on career development and networking for trainees in the bone healing field. Narrative The 17th Biennial Conference of the ORS/ISFR titled, “Thinking big on fracture repair” will be held in December of 2020. The goal of the event is to foster growth and innovation in the field of fracture-induced pain management, artificial learning/machine learning/smart technology, polytrauma and stem cells, and outcomes research.

"NextGen Random Forests Project Summary/Abstract Building from the PI's current R01, we propose next generation random forests (RF) designed for unprecedented accuracy and computational scalability to meet the challenges of today's complex and big data in the health sciences. Superior accuracy is achieved using super greedy trees which circumvent limitations on local adaptivity imposed by classical tree splitting. We identify a key quantity, forest weights, and show how these can be leveraged for further improvements and generalizability. In one application, improved survival estimators are applied to worldwide esophageal cancer data to develop guidelines for clinical decision making. Richer RF inference is another issue explored. Cutting edge machine learning methods rarely consider the problem of estimating variability. For RF, bootstrapping currently exists as the only tool for reliably estimating conﬁdence intervals, but due to heavy computations is rarely applied. We introduce tools to rapidily calculate standard errors based on U-statistic theory. These will be used to increase robustness of esophageal clinical recommendations and to investigate survival temporal trends in cardiovascular disease. In another application, we make use of our new massive data scalability for discovery of tumor and immune regulators of immunotherapy in cancers. This project will set the standard for RF computational performance. Building from the core libraries of the highly accessed R-package randomForestSRC (RF-SRC), software developed under the PIs current R01, we develop open source next generation RF software, RF-SRC Everywhere, Big Data RF-SRC, and HPC RF-SRC. The software will be deployable on a number of popular machine learning workbenches, use distributed data storage technologies, and be optimized for big-p, big-n, and big-np scenarios.

"International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) 2020 Project summary  The Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) society is dedicated to the promotion, preservation and facilitation of research and education in the fields of medical image computing and computer assisted interventions, including biomedical imaging and robotics. This aim is achieved through the organization and operation of regular international conferences of the highest quality, and publications that promote and foster the exchange and dissemination of advanced knowledge, expertise and experience by leading institutions and outstanding scientists, physicians, and educators around the world. MICCAI Conferences have their origin in three separate but related conferences beginning in early 1990s--Visualization in Biomedical Computing, Computer Vision and Virtual Reality in Robotics and Medicine, and Medical Robotics and Computer Assisted Surgery--, which merged into a single annual conference in 1998. MICCAI Conferences have defined new scientific disciplines over the years and have become the premier meeting in the field. The conference proceedings have an impact factor comparable to high-impact computational journals. Conference topics include, computer vision & medical image processing, computer-aided diagnosis, interventions & surgery, machine learning in medical imaging, guidance systems & robotics, visualization and virtual reality, bioscience and biology applications, imaging systems and new biomedical imaging applications, spanning disciplines such as radiology, pathology, surgery, oncology, cardiology, physiology, and psychiatry.  The MICCAI conference includes three days of oral presentations and poster sessions. The quality and importance of poster presentations are considered to be on a par with those of oral presentations, with both undergoing a rigorous double-blinded peer-review (~30% acceptance). Selected presented papers became landmark publications over the years with up to 2,000 citations. The conference series includes satellite events like community-driven software challenges, workshops and tutorials just before and/or after the main conference. These events focus on the current status and advances in topics relevant to MICCAI and are very well attended. The MICCAI Conferences span the entire globe and are usually rotated among the American, European, and Asian continents. Attendees are typically from over 45 countries, with strong student representation (>40%). The MICCAI 2020 Conference will be held in Lima, Peru in October 4th-8th, 2020. Since 2018, a Mentorship Program to connect students and young investigators with established mentors from academia and industry is also part of the conference. Along with the Mentorship Program and mission of the “Women in MICCAI” Committee, this proposal requests funds to support student and early investigator travel awards to enhance diversity in conference attendance (including women, underrepresented minorities, students with disabilities, and people from disadvantaged backgrounds) and provide minority groups with a unique opportunity to reach an international audience for career development and collaborations.

"Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium Project Summary/Abstract The Arkansas Research Alliance proposes to hold five annual workshops on the subject of bioinformatics. The purpose is to bring six major Arkansas institutions into closer collaboration. Those institutions are: University of Arkansas-Fayetteville; Arkansas State University; University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; University of Arkansas at Little Rock; University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff; and the National Center for Toxicological Research. The workshops will focus on capabilities at each of the six in sciences related to bioinformatics including artificial intelligence, big data, machine learning, food and agriculture, high speed computing, and visualization capabilities. As this work progresses, educational coordination and student encouragement will be important components. Principals from all six institutions are collaborating to accomplish the workshop goals. Project Narrative The FDA ability to protect the public health is directly related to its ability to access and utilize the latest scientific data. Increased proficiency in collecting, presenting, validating, understanding, and drawing quantitative inference from the massive volume of new scientific results is necessary for success in that effort. The complexity involved requires continued development of new tools available and being developed within the realm of information technology, and the workshops proposed here will address this need. Specific Aims  • Thoroughly understand the resources in Arkansas available for furthering the capabilities in  bioinformatics and its associated needs, e.g., access to high speed computing capability and use  of computational tools. • Develop a set of plans to harness and grow those capabilities, especially those that are relevant  to the needs of NCTR and FDA. • Stimulate interest and capability across Arkansas in bioinformatics to produce a larger cadre of  expertise as these plans are implemented. • Enlist NCTR’s help in directing the effort toward seeking local, national and international data  that can be more effectively analyzed to produce results needed by FDA and others, e.g.,  reviewing decades of genomic/treatment data on myeloma patients at the University of  Arkansas for Medical Sciences. • Develop ways in which the Arkansas capabilities can be combined into a coordinated, synergistic  force larger than the sum of its parts. • Encourage students and faculty in the development of new models and techniques to be used in  bioinformatics and related fields. • Improve inter-institutional communication, including developing standardized bioinformatics  curricula and more universal course acceptance.",Arkansas Bioinformatics Consortium,9961522,R13FD006690,[' '],FDA,ARKANSAS RESEARCH ALLIANCE,R13,2020,15000,0.04816184483138388
"IEEE Medical Imaging Conference Abstract  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) is the leading international scientific meeting bringing together a broad community interested in the physics, engineering and mathematical aspects of medical imaging, with special emphasis on nuclear medicine and multi-modal systems. The MIC runs in conjunction with the IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium (NSS) and the Workshop on Room Temperature Semiconductor X-ray and Gamma-ray Detectors (RTSD).  The purpose of the MIC is to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. While the traditional topics of primary interest are related to nuclear medicine techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT), increasing space will be also given to recently evolving imaging modalities such as X-ray, CT, optical, MR, with special emphasis on their multi-modal combination with nuclear medical imaging. Recently there has also been additional interest in employing deep learning and AI to enhance the field medical imaging. The conference provides a well-established forum of scientific exchange and dialogue between researchers in academia, industry, and government as well as education of the public, with special emphasis on young generations. This is reflected by the large spectrum of educational refresher sessions and short courses. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks $10,000 in funding for each of the next three years to provide 20 trainee grants of $500 each to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration, housing and/or short course fees for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions.  We anticipate that the main impact of this grant program will be to increase attendance of students and postdocs at the 2020 meeting, especially those typically underrepresented, as well as to support their participation in educational activities. It is important to bring young generations, especially women, minorities, and those with disabilities, into the medical imaging field, where they could become main actors in the coming years. They will attend plenary and oral presentations given by many of the world leaders in the nuclear medical imaging instrumentation, image processing, and quantitative analysis fields. Moreover, they will be given the unique opportunity of direct personal interaction through the short courses and dedicated poster presentations. In turn their work will be exposed to the other participants for critical evaluation, constructive suggestions and dissemination. Furthermore, many of these trainees will likely continue in this field, thereby contributing to advancing technology with high societal relevance as being increasingly used in the clinical management of disease and therapeutic interventions. Narrative  The IEEE Medical Imaging Conference (MIC) has the purpose to disseminate and foster new research in physics and bio-engineering methods in medical imaging. The conference covers a variety of medical imaging topics including quantitative imaging, PET/SPECT techniques, image reconstruction, imaging in radiation therapy, portable imaging, multi-modality systems, new medical imaging technologies, CT/MR/optical/ultrasound, parametric/kinetic image modeling, and signal/image processing and modeling. One of the major objectives of the conference is the education and encouragement of young investigators, and therefore this NIH R13 proposal seeks funding to provide twenty grants for each of the next three years to graduate students and postdoctoral fellows based at US institutions to partially cover costs of MIC conference registration and short course fees.",IEEE Medical Imaging Conference,10071524,R13EB030423,"['Academia', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disabled Persons', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease Management', 'Education', 'Educational Activities', 'Educational workshop', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Fees', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Gamma Rays', 'Generations', 'Government', 'Grant', 'Housing', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging technology', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'International', 'Italy', 'Japan', 'Joints', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medical Technology', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nuclear', 'Optics', 'Oral', 'Participant', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Running', 'Scientist', 'Semiconductors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Translations', 'Ultrasonography', 'Underrepresented Groups', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detector', 'disability', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'interest', 'kinetic model', 'meetings', 'member', 'models and simulation', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'nanoparticle', 'novel', 'nuclear science', 'parametric imaging', 'portability', 'posters', 'programs', 'public education', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiation detector', 'reconstruction', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'theranostics']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R13,2020,10000,0.019043456244615013
"Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The emergence of electronic medical records, large data registries and readily accessible, protected servers have resulted in an explosion of digital information with potentially high clinical impact for improving patient management and outcomes. Big data warehouses that capture standardized information within the scope of clinical practices allow trained scientists to not only engage in traditional hypothesis testing, but to also uncover new hypotheses, refine existing theories and apply new discoveries to health assessments and interventions. Despite the accessibility and potential impact of these data platforms, clinician scientists have traditionally directed experiments that incorporate relatively small sample sizes and data from individual laboratories, and have not been trained in big data analytics or in engaging appropriate team scientists who work in this space, such as computer scientists, biostatisticians and engineers. The overarching goal of this proposal is to mentor early patient oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analytics and to mentor and involve early data science scholars in communication and swallowing research. The PI proposes four primary mentorship and research goals in this K24 renewal proposal: 1. Train a cadre of early stage communication and swallowing scientists in data science methods, including machine learning, by an expert, interdisciplinary, collaborative data science team, 2. Engage and introduce early career data scientists from fields of biostatistics, computer science and engineering to communication and swallowing sciences, and respective data sets, toward facilitating interdisciplinary data science teams and research productivity, 3. Apply novel data science methods to identify phenotypes of swallowing impairment and severity classifications in patient groups known to be at high risk for nutritional and health complications related to dysphagia, and 4. Develop a new area of research in machine learning applications toward improving reliability of physiologic swallowing assessment. The data science theme of the career development and research plan directly align with NIDCD's Strategic Plan for Data Science which lists as its mission: Storing, managing, standardizing and publishing the vast amounts of data produced by biomedical research. NIDCD recognizes that accessible, well-organized, secure and efficiently operated data resources are critical to modern scientific inquiry…and by maximizing the value of data generated through NIH-funded efforts, the pace of biomedical discoveries and medical breakthroughs for better health outcomes can be accelerated. PROJECT NARRATIVE The emergence of electronic health records exposes clinicians to massive amounts of information about the millions of patients who suffer from communication and swallowing disorders, yet most clinical scientists do not have the training or skill to apply meaning to the data toward improving patient care. The overarching mentorship goal of this proposal is to train early, patient-oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analyses, including computer machine learning approaches. The research project will uncover distinct patterns and severity of swallowing impairments in large groups of patients with high risk medical diagnoses, which will have high impact on patient care planning and identification of treatments that directly target these impairments for improved outcomes.",Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders,9892671,K24DC012801,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Barium swallow', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'data registry', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'human error', 'impression', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K24,2020,183209,0.055277616265943776
"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio)statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field of health big data. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offers and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will primarily draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from three different departments within three different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science, Medicine, Population Health, Social and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including statistical modeling, data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high- dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and medical imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and success with the current summer program on Big Data led by this team with 164 students trained in the last 4 years (2015-2018) including 90 female students and 30 students from underrepresented minority groups. Fourteen of these participants from the last three years are currently graduate students in Michigan Biostatistics. The ongoing program has gained traction in the national landscape of summer research programs with 20% rate of admission and 80% rate of acceptance among those who are offered this opportunity. The program has consistently received very strong evaluation and our past alumni have become brand ambassadors and advocates for our program. We plan to build on the success and legacy of this program in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2019-2021). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a non-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 45 undergraduates nationally and internationally, with 20 domestic students supported by the requested SIBS funding mechanism and others supported by supplementary institutional and foundation support. We propose to expose the trainees to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of health Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. They will engage in mentored research projects in three primary areas of health big data: Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. Some of the projects will be defined in the area of cardiovascular precision medicine, defined by a team of highly quantitative researchers engaged in cardiovascular research that uses big data. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by U-M researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. We propose an inter-SIBS collaboration with Dordt College summer program trainees who will attend this concluding symposium. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world. We will offer multiple professional development opportunities and resources for graduate school preparation to our trainees so that they can reflect and plan beyond their senior year. All of our proposed activities are reflected through our three specific aims: Teaching, Mentoring and Dissemination. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose a six week long undergraduate summer institute: “Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data” to be held at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, with a group of approximately 45 undergraduate students recruited nationally and internationally, from 2019-2021. Funding is requested for 20 domestic students with supplementary funding expected to be garnered through institutional resources and private foundation support. The program builds on the success of our existing Big Data Summer Institute (BDSI) supported by a NIH BD2K Courses and Skills grant award that is ending in 2018. We plan to expose program students to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data and Human Health. We enhance our ongoing summer program structure in the current proposal by involving a team of researchers working at the intersection of cardiovascular research and data science with a focus on cardiovascular precision medicine where some of the new mentored research projects will be defined. We primarily focus on three genres of health Big Data arising in Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. The trainees will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty from Biostatistics, Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Statistics, Computer Science and Engineering, Information Sciences, Epidemiology and Medicine, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research.

"INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE Project Summary  To understand the many disorders of the brain it is necessary to grapple with its complexity.  Increasingly large and complicated data sets are being collected, but the tools for analyzing and  modeling the data are not yet available. More researchers trained in computational neuroscience are  desperately needed. This project supports graduate and undergraduate training programs in  computational neuroscience (TPCN) at both Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and the University of  Pittsburgh (Pitt), and a summer school in computational neuroscience for undergraduates, which are  available to students coming from colleges and universities throughout the United States.  The CMU-Pitt TPCN has 16 training faculty in computational neuroscience, 22 training faculty whose  laboratories are primarily experimental, and 20 training faculty whose laboratories are both  computational and experimental. At the graduate level the TPCN offers a PhD program in Neural  Computation (PNC) and joint PhD programs with CMU’s Department of Statistics (PNC-Stat) and its  Machine Learning Department (PNC- MLD), all set within a highly collegial, cross-disciplinary  environment of our Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition (CNBC), which is operated jointly by  CMU and Pitt. The CNBC was established in 1994 to foster interdisciplinary research on the neural  mechanisms of brain function, and now comprises 145 faculty having appointments in 22 departments.  At the undergraduate level a substantial pool of local students is supplemented during the summer  by a cohort of students from across the country. During this renewal funding period the project is  strengthening the role of statistics and machine learning throughout the training programs; (2) revising the summer undergraduate program by creating a didactic two-week “boot camp” at the  beginning, which includes a 20-lecture overview of computational neuroscience; (3) creating online  materials, in conjunction with the boot camp, that will serve not only our own students but also  the greater world of training in computational neuroscience; and (4) enhancing our minority  recruitment by (a) taking advantage of the boot camp and online materials, as well as making  promotional visits to targeted campuses, and (b) creating and running a one-year “bridge” program  to better prepare under-represented minorities for PhD programs.  TPCN trainees work in vertically integrated, cross-disciplinary research teams. Graduate students  take a year- long course in computational neuroscience that bridges modeling and modern statistical  machine learning approaches to neuroscience. To ensure their competency in core neuroscience  principles they also take courses in cognitive neuroscience, neurophysiology, and systems  neuroscience. They then pursue depth in a relevant quantitative discipline, such as computer  science, engineering, mathematics, or statistics. Graduate students have extended experience in at  least one experimental laboratory, and they take part in journal clubs and seminars within the  large Pittsburgh neuroscience community. Year-long undergraduates take courses in mathematics,  computer programming, statistics, and neuroscience; they take an additional course in neuroscience  or psychology and a course in computational neuroscience; and they complete a year-long research  project. In addition, they complete the TPCN summer program. Undergraduate trainees in the summer  program go through the boot camp on topics in computational neuroscience, including tutorials in  Matlab, statistical methods, fundamentals of differential equations, and ideas of neural coding;  they then complete a research project under careful guidance. All trainees will receive training in  responsible conduct of research. Across 5 years of funding, the TPCN supports 20 NRSA graduate  students, 10 non-NRSA graduate students, 30 undergraduate year-long fellows, and 60 undergraduate  summer fellows. Project Narrative  Research in neuroscience is crucial for attacking the causes of neurological and mental health  disorders. If the field of neuroscience is to continue its rapid advance, neuroscientists must use,  understand, and develop new technologies, acquire and analyze ever larger data sets, and grapple  more directly with the complexity of neurobiological systems. The primary goal of these training  programs will be to help train a new generation of interdisciplinary neuroscientists with strong  quantitative skills.",INTERDISCIPLINARY TRAINING IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE,10004013,R90DA023426,"['Appointment', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Country', 'Data Set', 'Differential Equation', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Status', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mathematics', 'Minority Recruitment', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Neurosciences', 'Psychology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Statistical Methods', 'Students', 'System', 'Teacher Professional Development', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'bridge program', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'college', 'computational neuroscience', 'computer program', 'computer science', 'data modeling', 'experience', 'graduate student', 'lectures', 'neuromechanism', 'neurophysiology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'responsible research conduct', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'summer program', 'tool', 'undergraduate student']",NIDA,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R90,2020,239423,0.07816930715771138
"Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design Project Summary/Abstract The next generation of bioengineering and biomedical researchers will have unprecedented access to technologies including wireless health, big data, genetic sequencing, and machine learning approaches to enable modern diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. This presents individuals trained at the interface of technology and biomedicine with an enormous opportunity to address the world’s needs in health and medicine. In the Bioengineering Department at the University of California, Los Angeles, we aim to develop students into leaders able to seamlessly identify clinical needs that technology can address, design and validate solutions that address these needs, communicate with a variety of stakeholders to build teams invested in problem-oriented solutions, and to navigate the regulatory and commercial pathways necessary to enable their technologies to thrive. The Bioengineering Capstone Series at UCLA leverages resources available at UCLA to enable students to: 1) gain insight into clinical needs directly from clinicians and educators across the Ronald Reagan Medical Center, David Geffen School of Medicine, School of Dentistry and UCLA Health System, 2) design their solutions through mentorship from engineering professors, 3) understand the complexities of the biomedical industry with support from the UCLA Technology Development Group and members of the Department of Engineering Industry Advisory Board, 4) utilize modern technologies in wireless health and data science by collaborating with the Center of Excellence for Mobile Sensor Data- to-Knowledge (MD2K) and Mobile Health (mHealth) Institute at UCLA, and 5) work with the National Science Foundation Precise Advanced Technologies and Health Systems for Underserved Populations Engineering Research Center (NSF PATHS- UP ERC) to learn to target and communicate their technologies to maximize societal benefits. Statement of Public Health Relevance: To prepare the next generation of engineers with skills in the design of therapeutics and medical devices, this research education program will provide bioengineering students at UCLA with enhanced opportunities to engage in real world design for biomedical applications. We will guide students through the medical design process from identifying needs, creating solutions which address these needs, and communicating the significance of their contributions to the greater community, ultimately yielding a larger pool of well-trained engineers to address biomedical challenges. !",Training the next generation of leaders in biomedical engineering design,9951056,R25EB027626,"['Address', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biomedical Technology', 'California', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Device or Instrument Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Freedom', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'High School Student', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Intellectual Property', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentorship', 'Modernization', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Recommendation', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'STEM field', 'School Dentistry', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Students', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Travel', 'Underrepresented Students', 'Underserved Population', 'Universities', 'Wireless Technology', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'clinically actionable', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education research', 'engineering design', 'experience', 'insight', 'interest', 'lectures', 'mHealth', 'medical schools', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'product development', 'professor', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'skills', 'technology development', 'undergraduate student']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R25,2020,21600,0.04627979357888216
"Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning There is an enormous need for qualified people to pursue careers in STEM (Noonan, 2017). However, the lack of a strong foundation in mathematics means students are less likely to pursue STEM majors and careers (Chen, 2013; Griffith, 2010; Huang, Taddese, & Walter, E, 2000; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010; Lowell et. al., 2009). Students from low-income families, women, and underrepresented minorities are also less likely to major in STEM (Bettinger, 2010; Griffith, 2010; Hill, Corbett & Rose, 2010; Kokkelenberg & Sinha, 2010). Improving math learning in the elementary grades is important to ensure children have the essential foundational skills and strong self-efficacy beliefs to be able to succeed with later mathematics and pursue careers in STEM. With this Fast-Track grant, Class Store ( CS ) , we propose to transform the way in which students learn Number and Operations in Base Ten. CS will be an engaging, commercially available, classroom-based economy game for tablets and Chromebooks that focuses on multi-digit operations. CS will encourage conceptual understanding and build math self-efficacy for students in grades K-5 within the context of a digital, classroom-based marketplace. Within the game, students will create stores, craft objects to sell, engage in selling/purchasing transactions, and work together to increase the value of the economy. In addition, the game will utilize artificial intelligence (AI) to detect strategies students use and help teachers facilitate rich mathematical discussions thereby enhancing students’ reasoning skills. Outcomes. The proposal will encourage three main outcomes, namely: 1) algorithms for detecting math strategies students use, 2) a discussion support dashboard, and 3) algorithms for predicting at-risk status. A key research aim is to determine whether the software can predict math strategies students use and detect which students are at-risk academically as compared to standardized assessment data, which will help teachers intervene appropriately. The discussion support dashboard will help to promote rich mathematical discussion, thereby improving students’ mathematical justification and conceptual understanding. The engaging game will bolster students’ motivation and self-efficacy in mathematics. Improving students’ academic outcomes and self-efficacy in base ten during elementary school will promote later success in high school mathematics. Since the number of advanced math classes students take is correlated with likelihood to complete a STEM degree, (Chen, 2013) a distal outcome of this proposal is increasing students pursuing careers in STEM. There is an enormous need for students majoring in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), yet lacking a strong foundation in mathematics makes students, especially women, minorities and those from low-income backgrounds, less likely to pursue careers in STEM. Class Store will bolster students’ mathematics abilities, including mathematical reasoning and self-efficacy, in the foundational area of Number and Operations in Base 10 in the short and long term. This will, in turn, lead to several positive distal outcomes, such as increased STEM majors and careers.",Building a classroom game economy to improve mathematical reasoning and prepare K-5 students for success in STEM learning,9889974,R44GM130197,"['Achievement', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Belief', 'Child', 'Code', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Files', 'Detection', 'Digit structure', 'Distal', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Foundational Skills', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'High School Student', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Low income', 'Marketing', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'STEM field', 'Sales', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics', 'Self Efficacy', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Tablets', 'Testing', 'Transact', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'dashboard', 'design', 'digital', 'elementary school', 'experience', 'field study', 'fifth grade', 'fourth grade', 'high school', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'lower income families', 'mathematical ability', 'mathematical learning', 'mathematical theory', 'operation', 'prediction algorithm', 'prototype', 'second grade', 'skills', 'student participation', 'success', 'support tools', 'teacher', 'usability']",NIGMS,"TEACHLEY, LLC",R44,2020,575531,0.08204297755904522
"Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) Project Summary/Abstract  The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have enabled the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic characterization of disease phenotypes, at the tissue and even the single cell level. This has allowed development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients. Thus, new genomic science educational initiatives need to be continually updated to educate the clinical and translational workforce on how to effectively interpret and apply the findings from genomics studies. Patients of providers who have participated in these educational initiatives also benefit as it allows for more rapid integration of genomic study findings into the clinical care setting. Thus, in response to PAR-19-185, we propose to develop and implement the Clinical Research Education in Genome Science (CREiGS) program that will not only focus on the analysis of genomic data, but also on gene-expression data, the integration of these two data types, as well as introductory theory and application of statistical and machine learning methods. Specifically we propose to accomplish the following specific aims: 1. Develop and successfully implement the online and in-person phases of CREiGS to increase the methodologic ingenuity by which researchers tackle important genomics-related clinical problems. 2. Establish a Diversity Recruitment External Advisory Board to ensure that the most effective strategies are employed to recruit URM doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty from academic institutions nationwide into CREiGS. 3. Enhance the dissemination phase of CREiGS by packaging and uploading the asynchronous lectures and the online critical thinking/problem solving assessments with solutions for publicly available, online teaching resources. 4. Implement effective methods to evaluate the efficacy of CREiGS by examining:1) the participants' grasp of the CREiGS core competencies, 2) the clarity and quality of the curriculum, 3) program logistics and operation, and 4) the participants' short-term and long-term success attributed to participation in CREiGS. In summary, we posit that CREiGS will provide participants with a solid foundation in genomics science to answer complex, clinical questions. We believe that CREiGS supports the mission of the NHGRI by providing researchers with rigorous training to “accelerate medical breakthroughs that improve human health.” Project Narrative The sensitivity and availability of omic technologies have allowed for the development of treatments that target specific disease subtypes, most notably in cancer treatment, and thus opened up opportunities for the development of precision/personalized medicine strategies for optimizing treatments for individual patients.

"Preparing the Next Generation of Biostatisticians in the Era of Data and Translational Sciences PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the era of newly emerging computational tools for data science, biostatisticians need to play a fundamental role in health sciences research. There is an urgent need to encourage US Citizens and Permanent Residents to pursue graduate training in biostatistics. The design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials and observational studies; the setting of regulatory policy; and the conception of laboratory experiments have been shaped by the fundamental contributions of biostatisticians for decades. Advances in genomics, medical imaging technologies, and computational biology; the increasing emphasis on precision and evidence-based medicine; and the widespread adoption of electronic health records; demand the skills of biostatisticians trained to collaborate effectively in a multidisciplinary environment and to develop statistical and machine learning methods to address the challenges presented by this data-rich revolutionary era of health sciences research. The proposed summer program which includes world-renowned clinical scientists and biostatisticians from two local universities, will provide an immense opportunity for student participants to learn basic yet modern statistical methods that are critical to uncovering new insights from such big and complex biomedical data and also illustrate the potential pitfalls of confounding and bias that may arise when analyzing biomedical data. A unique feature of the proposed training program is thus to expose the participants to not only basic statistical methods but also to the topics of computer science and bioinformatics which will be invaluable in creating the multidisciplinary teams required to tackle the complex research questions that often requires multipronged approaches. The proposed six-week training program will be structured around the NIH's Translation Science Spectrum and will introduce participants to opportunities in biostatistics through the lens of the science advanced by the contributions of biostatisticians. Following an initial set of weeks on basic training of biostatistical methods, the program will culminate in a data hack-a-thon style competition in which participants will employ the statistical and scientific knowledge gained during the program to produce the most innovative, statistically-sound, scientifically-relevant and effectively-communicated response to a set of research questions. The proposed research education program will enroll up to 20 such participants from across the nation and, through lectures, field trips, and opportunities to analyze data from real health sciences, inspire them to pursue graduate training. The program will draw upon considerable past collaborations and complementary resources of two local world-renowned universities to provide participants with an unparalleled view of the field, including award-winning instructors, internationally known methodological and clinical researchers, and a local area rich in opportunities to showcase careers in biostatistics. Special efforts will be made to enroll participants from underrepresented groups. Participants will be followed after completion, and the numbers attending graduate school in statistics and pursuing biostatistics careers will be documented. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biostatisticians are indispensible contributors to health sciences research. The demand for professionals with advanced training in biostatistics is high and will continue to increase, especially with the expanding challenges posed by big biomedical data.

"Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science Project Summary/Abstract The study of the human brain with neuroimaging technologies is at the cusp of an exciting era of Big Data. Many data collection projects, such as the NIH-funded Human Connectome Project, have made large, high- quality datasets of human neuroimaging data freely available to researchers. These large data sets promise to provide important new insights about human brain structure and function, and to provide us the clues needed to address a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, neuroscience researchers still face substantial challenges in capitalizing on these data, because these Big Data require a different set of technical and theoretical tools than those that are required for analyzing traditional experimental data. These skills and ideas, collectively referred to as Data Science, include knowledge in computer science and software engineering, databases, machine learning and statistics, and data visualization.  The Summer Institute in Data Science for Neuroimaging will combine instruction by experts in data science methodology and by leading neuroimaging researchers that are applying data science to answer scientiﬁc ques- tions about the human brain. In addition to lectures on the theoretical background of data science methodology and its application to neuroimaging, the course will emphasize experiential hands-on training in problem-solving tutorials, as well as project-based learning, in which the students will create small projects based on openly available datasets. Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science: Project Narrative The Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science will provide training in modern data science tools and methods, such as programming, data management, machine learning and data visualization. Through lectures, hands-on training sessions and team projects, it will empower scientists from a variety of backgrounds in the use of these tools in research on the human brain and on neurological and psychiatric brain disorders.",Summer Institute in Neuroimaging and Data Science,9875480,R25MH112480,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Competence', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Science Core', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Habits', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Problem Solving', 'Psychology', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Software Engineering', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'career', 'classification algorithm', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'data management', 'data visualization', 'design', 'e-science', 'experimental study', 'high dimensionality', 'insight', 'instructor', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'lectures', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurogenetics', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'project-based learning', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'summer institute', 'theories', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R25,2020,164298,0.07398405399969676
"HERCULES: Exposome Research Center PROJECT SUMMARY: HERCULES The vision of the HERCULES P30 is to demonstrably advance the role of environmental health sciences in clinical and public health settings using the platform of the exposome. Healthcare and biomedical research have become increasingly genome-centric. While much of this is due to the impressive achievements in genomics, which have consistently outpaced gains in environmental health, it is our contention that a more persuasive case needs to be made for environmental factors. Science and intuition support the idea that the environment plays just as large of a role as genetics for the majority of diseases. The exposome, which embraces a strategy and scale similar to genomic research, is poised to elevate the environment in discussions of health and disease. We will continue to grow and enhance the environmental health science research portfolio at Emory through cutting-edge technologies and innovative data solutions. We will build upon the superb relationships we have built with the local community and continue to push the mission of NIEHS on campus and across the scientific landscape. Based on the extraordinary progress over our first three years, we propose to retain our theme to use exposome-related concepts and approaches to improve human health. This simple and unifying vision will continue to stimulate discovery, promote collaboration, and enhance communication through the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1. To marshal physical and intellectual resources to support exposome-related approaches (high-resolution metabolomics, analytical chemistry, systems biology, machine learning, bioinformatics, high-throughput toxicology, and spatial and temporal statistical models) through cores, pilot funding, mentoring, and research forums. Specific Aim 2. To make major contributions towards exposome and environmental health science research. Specific Aim 3. To provide career development activities around innovative and emerging concepts and approaches related to the exposome. Specific Aim 4. To enhance and expand existing relationships with community partners to resolve environmental health issues in the community using exposome principles. Specific Aim 5. To provide infrastructure and resources to facilitate rapid translation of novel scientific findings into the development of prevention and treatment strategies in humans. Pursuit of HERCULES' aims will advance environmental health sciences within our institutions and in the scientific community.

"IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2020 Project Summary This R13 application will provide travel support for competitively selected U.S.-based students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty to present their work at the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2020 to be held April 4-8, 2020 at the Coralville Marriott Hotel & Conference Center near the University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa. ISBI is a scientific conference dedicated to mathematical, algorithmic, and computational aspects of biological and biomedical imaging, across all scales of observation (from microscopic to whole-body imaging) and is sponsored by both the IEEE Signal Processing Society (SPS) and the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBS). It attracts approximately 600-700 attendees each year involved in biomedical imaging research and development from academic institutions, government laboratories, and private companies. Since its inception in 2002, ISBI has become a leading international conference bringing together researchers from diverse algorithmic fields, applications, modalities, and size scales, to facilitate cross-fertilization of ideas. ISBI, like other IEEE SPS and EMBS conferences, requires submission and review of four-page papers which are peer-reviewed much like journal articles. In addition to oral and poster presentations of peer-reviewed papers in multiple tracks during the main conference, ISBI 2020 will also include special student events, tutorials, a “clinical day” emphasizing multi-disciplinary presentations/collaborations, plenary talks, workshops, and onsite grand challenges. Recipients of the travel awards will be competitively selected based on need and scientific excellence. U.S.- based students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior faculty with accepted papers will be eligible to apply. We will be particularly supportive in providing travel awards to women and under-represented groups to help increase the diversity of the attendees. We anticipate that the travel awards will provide sufficient funding to the awardees to make the cost-benefit ratio for attendance extremely favorable. Through their attendance at ISBI, the awardees will benefit through their exposure to the simultaneous breadth and depth of topics offered at ISBI (presented by a mixture of leaders in the field as well as those early in their careers), their experience of presenting their work at an international conference, and their interactions and discussions with other attendees and leaders in the field. The conference as a whole will also benefit by not only enabling the high-quality work of the attendees to be presented but by also enabling an increased attendance of (and discussions/ideas/interactions with) U.S.-based students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty with diverse backgrounds.

"8th International CEST workshop (CEST2020) Project Summary/Abstract The 8th International Workshop of chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI in November 2020 (CEST2020) brings together an international community of experts in CEST imaging. CEST MRI has gained tremendous interest from the research community, and many leading institutions have joined forces to optimize CEST MRI and develop new applications in a host of diseases including acute stroke, epilepsy, and, most importantly, tumor imaging. Recently, machine learning and neuron networks have been explored for CEST imaging. The CEST 2020 forges research and learning opportunities for students and young researchers in a dedicated forum unmatched by other meetings. CEST 2020 is being organized by Phillip Zhe Sun, Ph.D. (Emory University), in conjunction with the CEST Workshop steering committee of well- established scholars in the CEST MRI field. It will run November 8-11, 2020, at the Emory Conference Center Hotel located on the Emory University campus in Atlanta, Georgia. The goal is to bring together researchers from varying backgrounds and clinicians from related disciplines and to provide a forum for communication among these multi-disciplinary groups. The workshop will feature a blend of plenary sessions, invited scientific presentations, manuscripts, poster presentations, and panel discussions. The meeting will provide all participants the opportunity to present and learn emerging applications of CEST imaging. Emory University researchers have contributed to the development of the CEST MRI field, from the theory, experimental optimization, and quantification. Members well established in the CEST MRI field including Dr. Peter van Zijl, Dr. Dean Sherry, Dr. John Gore, Dr. Marty Pagel, and Dr. Reddy Ravinder, will attend and present their work. This creates an outstanding intellectual enrichment opportunity not just for well-established investigators but also for students, postdocs and junior faculty as they enter into this exciting field of MRI research. The primary goal is to create opportunities and offer supportive mentoring at this formative stage in the trainee's career to enhance their research potential and the likelihood of success. We will have two plenary sessions, two poster sessions, and two power pitch sessions, in which the goal is to share the state of the art CEST research and engage newcomers to the field. Also, we will select 3-4 oral presentations for each scientific session from submitted abstracts to promote the rising stars in the field and provide our feedback on their work, strength, and, most importantly, areas to improve. This grant will support students, postdocs and junior faculty to participate in the CEST2020 Workshop. Project Narrative The 8th Biennial International CEST workshop (CEST 2020) will focus on the technical development of CEST imaging and clinical applications in a broad spectrum of diseases.

"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics. The research proposed will apply novel strategies to further develop integrative machine learning analyses of multidimensional genomic data, discover clinically relevant predictive models, and create computational tools to accelerate future research.",Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models,9936223,R00HG009678,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Advisory Committees', 'Award', 'Bioconductor', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biotechnology', 'Budgets', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chemotherapy-Oncologic Procedure', 'Chromosomal Instability', 'Chromosomes', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'Coupling', 'CpG Island Methylator Phenotype', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomic Instability', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Instruction', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methylation', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'Yang', 'biomarker performance', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'data framework', 'data integration', 'data reduction', 'data standards', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'genomic signature', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'promoter', 'protein metabolite', 'response', 'single cell sequencing', 'statistics', 'tenure track', 'tool']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R00,2020,249000,0.017405539213028832
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9982966,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'big-data science', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'clinical database', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability', 'visual tracking']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2020,202463,0.020045622576373705
"Computerized detection and internet-based treatment of common mental disorders among college students in two Latin American LMICs PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: Objectives: This proposal is submitted in response to PAR-18-835 to detect, engage, and experimentally evaluate the effects of internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (e-CBT) to treat college students in two Latin American LMICs with major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder w/ or w/o comorbid common mental disorders (CMDs). Detection and engagement will be based on inexpensive internet-based self-report surveys and the intervention on inexpensive e-CBT to address the low resources in LMICs. Knowledge transfer to the primary LMIC collaborating institution (Mexican National Institute of Psychiatry Ramon de la Fuente Muniz [INPRFM]) will be a goal designed to facilitate dissemination to LMIC colleges/universities throughout Latin America. The study will build on prior research by collaborators in the WHO World Mental Health (WMH) survey consortium and WMH International College Study (WMH-ICS) initiative documenting high prevalence, impairment, and unmet need for treatment of CMDs among college students around the world and significant effects of e-CBT in treating these disorders in high income countries. Specific aims/Design/Methods: First, we will carry out a pragmatic clinical trial with students seeking treatment for CMDs at student clinics in four universities in Colombia and Mexico. Students on waitlists for student clinic services will be offered a possibility of receiving guided e-CBT immediately while staying on the list. 50% of the students with CMD who express interest will be randomized to guided e-CBT and the other 50% to treatment as usual (TAU). Short-term aggregate intervention effects will be assessed 60 days after randomization and longer-term effects 12 months after randomization. We will then use ensemble machine learning methods to predict heterogeneity of treatment effects of guided e-CBT versus TAU and develop a precision treatment rule (PTR) to predict which students will respond best to which intervention. We will then implement a SMART design in which we randomize 50% to the treatment arm predicted to be optimal by the PTR and the other 50% to randomization across arms. Additionally, we will carry out annual WMH-ICS internet-based mental health needs assessment surveys with a probability sample of students to estimate unmet need for treatment and barriers to treatment. Students screening positive for CMD who are not in treatment and report resistance to in-person treatment will be randomized to guided e-CBT to determine if access to guided e-CBT reduces the unmet need for treatment among students with CMDs who fail to seek treatment at student health clinics. Finally, the technology for screening, delivering e-CBT, and updating the precision treatment model, implemented initially by Harvard Medical School, will be transferred to INPRFM for dissemination to universities in LMICs throughout Latin America. That many senior regional mental health policy makers are trained at INPRFM and return for periodic policy summits, coupled with the close working relationship of INPRFM with the Pan American Health Organization, bode well for such dissemination efforts. PROJECT NARRATIVE The research will provide valuable information to school administrators and government policy makers in the participating LMICs to document the burden of CMDs among university students, the extent of unmet need for treatment of these disorders, the effectiveness of inexpensive-scalable e-CBT interventions to treat these disorders, and for whom e-CBT is most effective.

"The University of Iowa Clinical and Translational Science Award ABSTRACT The Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) at the University of Iowa (UI) was established by the Board of Regents to realize three objectives – first, to lead the development of translational science at the UI; second, to advance translational science as a distinct academic discipline; and third, to disseminate capacities in translational science across the State of Iowa. This mandate enabled us to tackle large problems affecting translational science that required institutional solutions, such as transforming regulatory processes for human subjects research, developing an informatics infrastructure for integrating electronic medical record and other health care data, establishing bi-directional relationships with community organizations, and revitalizing the pipeline of well trained clinical and translational researchers. Iowa is a rural state, which brings special health care needs and challenges. We have used these rural considerations as a catalyst for driving our approach to clinical and translational research pushing our teams to develop strategies to engage rural populations of all ages and backgrounds and to create new approaches that overcome the geographic barriers in a rural state. We are capitalizing on our established community practice networks of family physicians, clinics, school nurses and pharmacists. We utilize e Health/ e Learning platforms in novel ways and will test the efficacy of these new methods of engagement. As we move research “Beyond Our Borders,” we have created methods to capture real-time, real-life data from the home and to correlate this environmentally specific, comprehensive data to human performance. The ICTS is engaging with other CTSA hubs and national CTR systems to empirically test different approaches and to develop the evidence base of proven strategies for accelerating translation that can be more broadly disseminated. Though distance and rurality drive our approaches, the strategies that we develop are simply new and potentially better ways to generate broad representation and improved participation by patients, healthcare teams and academicians. Through our local, state and national partnerships, UI and the ICTS are poised to move clinical and translational discovery rapidly into healthcare practice in a variety of clinical settings. PROJECT NARRATIVE The mission of the University of Iowa Institute for Clinical and Translational Science (ICTS) is to accelerate translational science through programs to develop the translational workforce, promote the engagement of community members and other stakeholders, to promote research integration across the lifespan, and to catalyze innovative clinical and translational research. The ongoing development of collaborative data-based infrastructure and services is a central tenant to achieving this mission. The goals of this proposal are: for Iowa to join the N3C partnership, contributing data in an effective method that evolves and improves over time, to enable Iowa researchers to leverage the N3C data resource in their research and to leverage the N3C framework for other areas of research in the future.",The University of Iowa Clinical and Translational Science Award,10201104,UL1TR002537,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Award', 'COVID-19', 'Caring', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Communities', 'Community Practice', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Emergency Situation', 'Family Physicians', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Human', 'Human Subject Research', 'Image', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Iowa', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patient Participation', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Rural', 'Rural Health', 'Rural Population', 'School Nursing', 'Services', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfer Agreement', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'catalyst', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'collaborative approach', 'community organizations', 'coronavirus disease', 'data acquisition', 'data enclave', 'data exchange', 'data resource', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'efficacy testing', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'improved', 'informatics infrastructure', 'innovation', 'interest', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pandemic disease', 'phenotypic data', 'programs', 'rurality', 'social determinants', 'support tools', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,UL1,2020,98933,0.01997144695154133
"Mixed Reality System for STEM Education and the promotion of health-related careers Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of existing medical props with interactive media to provide engaging and cooperative group STEM learning experiences. Significance: The PowerPoint lecture style has become the standard method for teaching groups of students. Unfortunately, this style does not emphasize student-instructor or student-student instruction, and in fact seems to have made students even less engaged than before. Broad agreement exists in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes. A variety of teaching aids, for example plastic medical props and mannequins are available to support more engaging learning exercises. Despite their substantial benefits, physical props are fundamentally limited as they are primarily static (e.g. fixed coloration, disease depiction), their internal structures (with limited exceptions) often bear little resemblance to actual human anatomy, and they are passive objects. Hypothesis: A system which can provide more engaging interaction with physical props will be able to improve student retention and increase interest in STEM related subjects. Specific Aims: To prove the feasibility of the proposed system in Phase I IDL will 1) Determine stakeholder requirements through round table discussions; 2) Create prototype system hardware & software to augment learning with physical props; and 3) Validate the prototype system through a pilot study. The overall Phase I effort will demonstrate the ability of the proposed system to augment learning with physical props. In the Phase II effort IDL will ready the system for commercialization by 1) Developing production-quality software, hardware, and user interfaces; 2) Developing a set of comprehensive curricula for the system; and 3) Validating the system through human subject testing. Project Narrative Passive learning methods, i.e. PowerPoint lectures, have become the standard method for teaching groups of students topics including Anatomy and Physiology in spite of broad agreement in the field of science education that more engaging pedagogies benefit students in introductory classes.

"Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults Project Summary/Abstract Proposed is a system to combine and leverage the advantages of both existing physical mannequin-based training and virtual media to support clinical learning using Augmented Reality (AR). Significance: Education in clinical settings is often challenging, infeasible, risky, difficult to organize, time-consuming, and expensive. Due to these barriers, the value of mannequin-based simulation is well recognized and is incorporated extensively into medical education. In general, the purpose of mannequin use in education is to simulate a physical ""patient"" on which to learn, demonstrate, and test skill without fear of harming patients prior to entering clinical environments. Despite their substantial benefits, physical mannequins have several fundamental limitations that do not allow them to demonstrate the many unique phases and expressions of a disease or person-to-person differences in anatomy and physiology. This limits the ability for a learner to view dynamic changes over time and to explore disease progression and consequences of interventions. Hypothesis: This research hypothesizes that existing, current mannequins can be enhanced through an innovative and practical Augmented Reality solution. In the Phase I effort a prototype system and sample educational material covering Pressure Ulcer care was developed and analyzed through pilot studies with Nursing educators, Doctoral Degree in Nursing (DNP) students, and pre-licensure students. The pilot results of the technology demonstrated a high degree of positivity and exceptional enthusiasm and all Phase I metrics of success were met or exceeded. Specific Aims: In Phase II the following aims are proposed: 1) Design a comprehensive suite of course content and design the technology's integration into a College of Nursing course, 2) Develop a production-ready system, and 3) Validate the system utility through human subject testing and expert evaluation of the system. Project Narrative Over the past decade, medical simulation has been experiencing explosive growth and widespread adoption. There are now over 800 medical simulation centers in the US alone, located in medical schools, nursing schools, hospitals, military simulation centers, and schools of allied health professions. The global market for Mannequin-Based Simulation is projected to reach $1 Billion by 2020. It is hypothesized that the combination of existing physical mannequin-based training with virtual media will open new possibilities for exploration and enhanced learning interactions for medical education. 3T",Augmented Reality System for the Education of Clinical Caregivers of Older Adults,9964623,R44AG057257,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Allied Health Profession', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Augmented Reality', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Consumption', 'Course Content', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dissection', 'Doctor&apos', 's Degree', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational Materials', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Focus Groups', 'Fright', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Licensure', 'Location', 'Manikins', 'Medical', 'Medical Education', 'Military Personnel', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Nursing Schools', 'Nursing Students', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Principal Investigator', 'Production', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Scientist', 'Severity of illness', 'Skin', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Ursidae Family', 'animation', 'base', 'caregiver education', 'college', 'commercialization', 'cost', 'decubitus ulcer', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'human subject', 'impression', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'miniaturize', 'person centered', 'professor', 'programs', 'prototype', 'simulation', 'skills', 'success', 'teacher', 'virtual']",NIA,"INNOVATIVE DESIGN LABS, INC.",R44,2020,688185,0.01706842509740529
"An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning Abstract: The next generation of science and health care professionals will need to understand the foundational concepts of physics. While textbooks play a critical role in science learning, these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. Unfortunately, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current physical science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with interactive texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned force and motion (NGSS PS2A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing and developing science learning games (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content in both English and Spanish to address 9 additional NGSS standards (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive learning technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning disabilities. This Fast-Track project will produce a bilingual, digital platform to support students’ understanding of Physical Science, which will allow students to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages, play science learning games, and receive personalized content. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students, develop teacher support materials, and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning",10006915,R44GM137622,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Books', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'physical science', 'reading ability', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2020,231500,0.08190706922006573

"WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE UNDIAGNOSED DISEASES NETWORK CLINICAL SITE 1.0 PROJECT SUMMARY The scientific premise of this application is that the individualized translational research process of the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) developed during Phase I is scalable and that its impact on patients, families, and disease discovery can be advanced and sustained by addition of a Clinical Site at Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM). WUSM represents a large academic medical center that is fully integrated with world-renowned basic science capabilities and demonstrated expertise in a gene first approach for patients with undiagnosed diseases. The highly collaborative clinical and biomedical research culture at WUSM promotes interactions within and across Departments, with institutional genomic, clinical, computational, and model system experts, and with colleagues regionally, nationally, and internationally. These interactions support recruitment, selection, evaluation, diagnosis discovery, and follow up of pediatric and adult patients with undiagnosed diseases through both established networks and individual referrals. Building on this infrastructure, WUSM faculty and staff will advance the success of the UDN in diagnosing and managing disease in undiagnosed patients by, first, using, refining, and improving protocols designed during Phase I of the UDN for comprehensive, timely clinical evaluations of 30 undiagnosed patients annually. Secondly, we will collect, securely store, and share standardized, high-quality clinical and laboratory data including genotyping, phenotyping, and documentation of environmental exposures and promote an integrated and collaborative community across the UDN and among laboratory and clinical investigators focused on defining the pathophysiology, cell biologic, and molecular mechanisms that cause these difficult to diagnose diseases. Thirdly, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will propose a bioinformatics plan for leveraging institutional infrastructure and expertise to develop innovative strategies to improve discovery of pathogenic variants. Fourthly, the assessment, dissemination, outreach, and training plan will accelerate assessment and dissemination of data, protocols, consent materials, and methods, availability of educational and outreach materials for participants, clinicians, and other researchers, engagement of underrepresented minorities, and training for students, fellows, staff, and faculty in collaboration with WUSM’s Clinical and Translational Science Award infrastructure. Finally, WUSM will make a clear institutional commitment to maintain its Clinical Site, to adapt UDN Phase I practices for sustainability, to contribute to formation of a sustainable national UDN resource, and to adapt to unique needs and unexpected circumstances that may arise once Common Fund support ends in fiscal year 2022. 2.0 PROJECT NARRATIVE Undiagnosed diseases in children and adults represent frustrating and costly challenges for patients, families, physicians, and society.

Building on established institutional infrastructure similar to the Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN), Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) will establish a UDN Clinical Site to improve the level of diagnosis and care for patients with undiagnosed diseases, facilitate research into the etiology of undiagnosed diseases, and promote an integrated and collaborative community across multiple UDN Clinical Sites, Sequencing Cores, Model Organisms Screening Centers, and among laboratory and clinical investigators. Specifically, the WUSM UDN Clinical Site will annually recruit, select, evaluate, and follow 30 participants with disorders in any clinical specialty, adult and pediatric, provide comprehensive clinical evaluations that require <5 days and follow up, and participate in all UDN protocols, data management and sharing, and sustainability planning.",Washington University School of Medicine Undiagnosed Diseases Network Clinical Site,9977220,U01HG010215,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Accreditation', 'Adult', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Businesses', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Consent', 'DNA Sequencing Facility', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Documentation', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Family Physicians', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Geographic Locations', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Laboratories', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Committee', 'Secure', 'Societies', 'Standardization', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cost', 'data dissemination', 'data management', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'exome sequencing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'medical specialties', 'network models', 'operation', 'outreach', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'sequencing platform', 'student training', 'success', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,U01,2020,550000,0.04098763973253483
"Pipelines into Quantitative Aging Research Project Summary It is well documented that a diverse workforce has the potential to reduce racial and ethnic disparities, which have strong effects in aging populations1-3. As the percentage of racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. population increases, including among the aged population, the public health workforce should reflect this diversity1,4,5. With an increase in undergraduate public health majors across the country6,7, due in part to heightened excitement and opportunities in data science and quantitative big data analysis, and with breakthroughs in the science of aging on the horizon, this is an opportune moment to develop strong pipeline programs for underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduates. We will target URM undergraduates who have quantitative and computational interests and expose them to opportunities for graduate study and research careers, and the possibilities and excitement of marrying their quantitative interests with substantive research in aging. Introducing undergraduates, who are more diverse in public health majors than other majors7, and than graduate students6, to careers in public health, holds much promise for increasing the diversity of graduate students and faculty in the field, which has increased very little in the past 20 years6. This holds for the MSTEM subfields of public health, such as Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Data Science, as well. Motivated by these factors, and in response to NIA Funding Opportunity (PAR-17-290), “MSTEM: Advancing Diversity in Aging Research through Undergraduate Education (R25),” we propose an intensive, six-week summer program for 12 undergraduates from underrepresented backgrounds with interests in Biostatistics, Epidemiology, Data Science and other quantitative methods to learn about the applications of these methods in aging research. The summer program includes formal instruction, a broad lecture series, mentored research projects, oral research presentation at an annual symposium, career and professional development sessions, site visits to labs and other research settings, group and informal mentoring, social activities and network building, and training in responsible conduct of research. To reinforce the intensive summer experience, we will continue to offer group and individual mentoring and research experiences into the following academic years. Additionally, we will offer a select group of summer program participants the opportunity to return to NYU during the January term for an extended research experience and a quantitative course. With the guidance of a professional evaluator and internal and external advisory committees, we will evaluate all aspects of our program and review results in real-time to enable constant adjustment and improvement. Our proposal addresses three critical needs to strengthen and galvanize the research enterprise in the field of aging: increased engagement of MSTEM experts, increased engagement of URM researchers, and increased attention to disparities. We believe that our intensive and long-term programmatic components will support the entry of talented URM students into successful careers in MSTEM research in aging. Project Narrative The goal of this R25 program is to increase the participation of underrepresented minority groups in the fields of Biostatistics and quantitative Public Health, with a collaborative focus on the diseases and processes of aging. The program includes an intensive six-week summer program for 12 students, with formal and informal instruction, mentored research, and extensive professional development activities, with a culminating symposium. For lasting impact, follow-up mentoring, continuing research and professional development will occur on a regular basis, both via webcast platforms and return, in-person visits.",Pipelines into Quantitative Aging Research,10024768,R25AG067931,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Attention', 'Autopsy', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Career Choice', 'Community Networks', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Diverse Workforce', 'Education', 'Epidemiology', 'Faculty', 'Funding Opportunities', 'GRE Preparation', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Joints', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Program Reviews', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Series', 'Site Visit', 'Statistical Computing', 'Students', 'Talents', 'Time', 'Training', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Visit', 'aging population', 'biomarker selection', 'career', 'cohort', 'design', 'epidemiologic data', 'epidemiology study', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'faculty mentor', 'follow-up', 'graduate student', 'informal learning', 'interest', 'lectures', 'meetings', 'minority undergraduate', 'posters', 'programs', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'response', 'responsible research conduct', 'social', 'student mentoring', 'summer program', 'symposium', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student', 'underrepresented minority student']",NIA,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R25,2020,367149,0.04658709349177738
"Patient Oriented Research and Mentorship and Training in Functional Neuroimaging of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder ABSTRACT  This K24 Mid-Career Investigator Career Development Award seeks support for training and mentorship for Christopher Pittenger, MD, Ph.D., a well-established, tenured Associate Professor in Psychiatry at Yale University, Director of the Yale OCD Research Clinic, and Assistant Chair for Translational Research in the Department of Psychiatry. Dr. Pittenger leads a robust patient-oriented research (POR) research program, which is integrated with his basic/translational lab-based research and has produced important new insights into the neurobiological underpinnings and novel treatment avenues for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (TS). Dr. Pittenger has a long-standing commitment to mentorship; most notably, he is Co-Director of the Neuroscience Research Training Program (NRTP), the research track within the Yale psychiatry residency.  The training plan supported by this grant will allow Dr. Pittenger to increase his skills in quantitative analysis, with a focus on advanced statistical methods and on the design and analysis of fMRI studies. These are areas in which he already has active research with expert collaborators; the aim of the proposed training plan is to enhance his own proficiency to make him a more effective collaborator and mentor in these important domains. Additional training is focused on his own abilities as a mentor and leader, with the goal of increasing his efficacy in the management of his own research groups and in effective and individualized mentorship. These training activities will take place in the context of two NIMH- funded research studies. The first, R01 MH116038, is a recently funded grant on which Dr. Pittenger is co-PI with his close collaborator Alan Anticevic and deploys cutting-edge imaging technology and data analysis approaches to examine brain network connectivity parallels and predictors of therapeutic response to pharmacotherapy in OCD. The second, R01 MH100068, is a grant with collaborator Michelle Hampson that is developing real-time fMRI neurofeedback as a probe and potential treatment for OCD, with promising early results. These two exciting projects provide a fruitful vehicle for the proposed training in statistics and neuroimaging.  Dr. Pittenger will devote substantial time to mentoring under this award. One major focus will be the NRTP; the plan is for him to take over as Director of this program over the next few years, and to take the lead in the next resubmission of our T32 grant in 2022. Support of this increased mentorship effort is a second major motivation for the current application. Dr. Pittenger will also provide mentorship to students, postdocs, and junior faculty in his own research program and throughout the Department of Psychiatry  Together, these integrated plans for training, research, and mentorship will support a well-established mid-career investigator whose robust research program is producing important insights into the neurobiology and treatment of OCD and TS, and whose dedicated mentorship efforts are helping to establish a new generation of translationally grounded patient-oriented researchers in psychiatric neuroscience.

"Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Dr. McCoy is an endocrinologist and primary care physician specializing in the care for patients with diabetes and other chronic health conditions. Her long-term goal is to become an independent researcher and leader in evaluating, improving, and individualizing diabetes care through effective use of big data completed by qualitative insights from patients and those involved in their care. The short-term training goals of this proposal are to acquire: 1) proficiency in statistics and data science; 2) experience in qualitative research; 3) skills in clinical trial design; and 4) communication and leadership skills to lead multi-disciplinary research. The proposal's research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic, which has a strong history of training physician scientists and a well-developed infrastructure for education and research. Dr. McCoy has access to an ideal set of data assets, the OptumLabs Data Warehouse and the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry, and the support of an exceptional team of mentors and advisors who are national leaders in diabetes outcomes and health care delivery research, shared decision-making, qualitative research, and data science. Optimization of glycemic control, while avoiding severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, is the cornerstone of diabetes management. Severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia are often preventable, yet continue to incur substantial morbidity, psychological distress, impaired quality of life, and economic burden. There are no validated tools to predict these events and as a result clinicians lack a practical and reliable means to identify high risk patients. The goal of Dr. McCoy's work is to address this critical gap in diabetes management. In Aim 1, she will use large database analysis and novel analytic methods to characterize the patterns of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia among adults with diabetes in the U.S. In Aim 2, she will build on Aim 1 to develop and validate computationally efficient concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that could be used in clinical encounters. In Aim 3, she will directly engage patients and their clinicians in conversation about severe hypoglycemia /hyperglycemia risk in order to better understand how information about severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk is perceived, interpreted, and used. These studies will serve as foundation for two R01 applications to be submitted during Years 4 and 5, and will advance the science and practice of personalized diabetes care through integration of data science and qualitative methods for the purpose of understanding, predicting, and ultimately preventing severe hypoglycemic/hyperglycemic events. Dr. McCoy has a proven track record of scientific productivity and innovation, and a strong foundation in using secondary data for health services and outcomes research in diabetes. In summary, the training, mentoring, and research proposed here are essential for Dr. McCoy's career development as she develops research independence and expertise in the crucial interface between patients and their clinical teams, evidence-based medicine, and big data. PROJECT NARRATIVE Severe hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events in the management of diabetes mellitus continue to incur high morbidity, psychological distress, and economic costs; yet, these events may be prevented with individualization of treatment goals and regimens if high risk patients are identified prospectively. The proposed research will leverage big data analytics and qualitative research to 1) characterize the epidemiology of severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in the U.S.; 2) develop and validate concurrent risk prediction models for severe hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; and 3) enrich the understanding of severe hypoglycemia/ hyperglycemia risk and risk model utilization through qualitative patient and clinician engagement.",Predicting the Risk of Severe Hypoglycemic and Hyperglycemic Events in Adults with Diabetes,9983016,K23DK114497,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Calibration', 'California', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Communication', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Discrimination', 'Economic Burden', 'Endocrinologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Evidence Based Medicine', 'Face', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Outcomes and Health Services Research', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Productivity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Quality of life', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regimen', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Research Training', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Self Care', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical encounter', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'data warehouse', 'diabetes management', 'disease phenotype', 'economic cost', 'education research', 'experience', 'glycemic control', 'health care delivery', 'health data', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'psychologic', 'psychological distress', 'risk prediction model', 'shared decision making', 'skills', 'social', 'statistics', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,K23,2020,169005,0.03378444405133302
"Integrative Biology Approach to Identify and Characterize Roles of lncRNAs Associated with Psoriasis Pathology PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Candidate After the completion of my Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, I joined the Center for Statistical Genetics at the University of Michigan (U-M) as research fellow and acquired extensive training in analysis on high- dimensional biological data. I uncovered a strong interest in studying the genetics and genomics of psoriasis when working with Dr. James Elder at the U-M, and I developed a fascination in understanding the functional roles of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in cutaneous diseases. I joined the Department of Dermatology at the U-M as a faculty in summer of 2015, with secondary appointments in the Department of Computational Medicine & Bioinformatics and the Department of Biostatistics. In addition, I direct the new Center for Cutaneous Bioinformatics within the Department of Dermatology, and serve to supervise and implement an analysis pipeline for studies investigating the immunological mechanisms for different skin diseases. Career Development Plan I aim to become a future leader in combining in silico discovery and bench experiments to advance biomedical research in autoimmune skin disorders. My objective in seeking a Mentored Research Scientist Development Award is to acquire the additional knowledge, training, and experience necessary for me to become an independent scholar in developing novel systems biology approaches to decipher the pathology and mechanisms of cutaneous diseases. The five year training proposed will provide knowledge and experience in aspects that are critical to my success, and they are: i) To develop knowledge and experimental skills in cutaneous biology --- achieved by guidance from Dr. Elder (investigative dermatology), intense research meetings/conferences, and practical laboratory experience in cutaneous research; ii) To develop knowledge and skills to study immunological systems of autoimmune skin diseases --- achieved by supervision from Dr. Johann Gudjonsson (skin immunology), attending formal Immunology courses and seminars, and earning laboratory experience from immunology experiments; iii) To advance skills in developing statistical and computational approaches --- accomplished by mentoring from Dr. Goncalo Abecasis (computational biologist), research meetings, and conducting research projects requiring advanced skills and knowledge in quantitative science; iv) To cultivate my professional development through enhancing scientific connections, grantsmanship skills, and educator portfolio --- achieved by establishing connections with colleagues during meetings, visiting King’s College London as scholar, attending a grantsmanship workshop and bootcamp, and learning mentoring skills through teaching formal classes and mentoring research students. Through the intensive and comprehensive training, I will be well grounded in conducting basic science experiments and also be able to capitalize my advanced knowledge in quantitative science to model mechanisms in cutaneous diseases. Research Project The research project will use psoriasis as a disease model to study the roles of lncRNAs in complex cutaneous disorders. I will test the hypotheses that (i): some lncRNAs are key causal elements and potentiate pathogenic inflammatory reactions in psoriasis development and (ii) by combining in silico predictions and in vitro validations we are able to provide comprehensive characterization of skin-expressing lncRNAs in keratinocytes and lymphocytes to infer their pathological implications for psoriasis. This work will demonstrate how we can take advantages of the genomic data to develop an integrative biology framework to provide novel biological insights and understand pathological roles of lncRNAs. Significance Psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated skin disease with complex genetic architecture. It is estimated that over 4 million Americans and 100 million people worldwide suffer from this disease. While genetic association studies have revealed the disease loci are highly enriched in non-coding regions, it is very challenging to translate genetic signals to biologic effects. In fact, most of the causal genes have not yet been identified. Our preliminary results showed that lncRNA is a class of gene that has largely been understudied for their roles in psoriasis, and both genetic and transcriptomic data suggested they can play important functions in psoriasis pathogenesis. By combining in silico analysis and in vitro validation we can expand our knowledge of lncRNAs in skin biology, and generate important hypotheses for future experiments. The results of this project can also identify novel biomarkers, and ultimately assist in the therapeutic drug discovery.
