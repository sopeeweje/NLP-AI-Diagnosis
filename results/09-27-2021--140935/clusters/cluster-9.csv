"Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation Summary/Abstract Alignment of biological sequences is a key step in understanding their evolution, function, and patterns of activity. Here, we describe Machine Learning approaches to improve both accuracy and speed of highly- sensitive sequence alignment. To improve accuracy, we develop methods to reduce erroneous annotation caused by (1) the existence of low complexity and repetitive sequence and (2) the overextension of alignments of true homologs into unrelated sequence. We describe approaches based on both hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks to dramatically reduce these sorts of sequence annotation error. We also address the issue of annotation speed, with development of a custom Deep Learning architecture designed to very quickly filter away large portions of candidate sequence comparisons prior to the relatively-slow sequence-alignment step. The results of these efforts will be incorporated into forks of the open source sequence alignment tools HMMER, MMSeqs, and (where appropriate) BLAST; we will also work with community developers of annotation pipelines, such as RepeatMasker and IMG/M, to incorporate these approaches. The development and incorporation into these widely used bioinformatics tools will lead to widespread impact on sequence annotation efforts. Narrative Modern molecular biology depends on effective methods for creating sequence alignments quickly and accurately. This proposal describes a plan to develop novel Machine Learning approaches that will dramatically increase the speed of highly-sensitive sequence alignment, and will also address two significant sources of erroneous sequence annotation, (i) the presence of repetitive sequence in biological sequences, and (ii) the tendency for sequence alignment algorithms to extend alignments beyond the boundaries of true homology. The proposed methods represent a mix of applications of hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks, and build on prior success in applying such methods to the problem of sensitive sequence annotation.",Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation,9887588,R01GM132600,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Error Sources', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Industry Standard', 'Insertion Mutation', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Biology', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proteins', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Takifugu', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'computing resources', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'markov model', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA,R01,2019,286435,0.006907651693899272
"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,9800752,R01AI146028,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'functional group', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'learning strategy', 'markov model', 'pathogen', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2019,632498,-0.007683127829770131
"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,9664620,R01CA218094,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Fc Receptor', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunize', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Machines', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phage Display', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical methods', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive test', 'receptor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2019,573396,0.009155920554943207
"Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data Big data is now ubiquitous in every field of modern scientific research. Many contemporary applications, such as the recent national microbiome initiative (NMI), greatly demand highly flexible statistical machine learning methods that can produce both interpretable and reproducible results. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify crucial causal factors that are responsible for the response from a large number of available covariates, which can be statistically formulated as the false discovery rate (FDR) control in general high-dimensional nonlinear models. Despite the enormous applications of shotgun metagenomic studies, most existing investigations concentrate on the study of bacterial organisms. However, viruses and virus-host interactions play important roles in controlling the functions of the microbial communities. In addition, viruses have been shown to be associated with complex diseases. Yet, investigations into the roles of viruses in human diseases are significantly underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to develop mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches to deal with highly complex big data and the applications of these approaches to solve fundamental and important biological and biomedical problems. There are four interrelated aims. In Aim 1, we will theoretically investigate the power of the recently proposed model-free knockoffs (MFK) procedure, which has been theoretically justified to control FDR in arbitrary models and arbitrary dimensions. We will also theoretically justify the robustness of MFK with respect to the misspecification of covariate distribution. These studies will lay the foundations for our developments in other aims. In Aim 2, we will develop deep learning approaches to predict viral contigs with higher accuracy, integrate our new algorithm with MFK to achieve FDR control for virus motif discovery, and investigate the power and robustness of our new procedure. In Aim 3, we will take into account the virus-host motif interactions and adapt our algorithms and theories in Aim 2 for predicting virus-host infectious interaction status. In Aim 4, we will apply the developed methods from the first three aims to analyze the shotgun metagenomics data sets in ExperimentHub to identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with several diseases at some target FDR level. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for metagenomics studies under a variety of environments. Big data is ubiquitous in biological research. Identifying causal factors associated with complex diseases or traits from big data is highly important and challenging. New statistical and computational tools will be developed to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) for molecular sequence data based on the novel model-free knockoffs framework. They will be used to detect sequence motifs for viruses and motif-pairs for virus-host interactions, and to analyze multiple metagenomics data sets related to complex diseases.",Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data,9753295,R01GM131407,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archaea', 'Attention', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Mathematics', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Non-linear Models', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Shotguns', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'model design', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'power analysis', 'response', 'simulation', 'theories', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction', 'virus identification']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,279949,0.005945918981120366
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9705993,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,314000,0.01616501530296137
"Software for Antibody Epitope Prediction Accurate epitope prediction is important for the development of antibody-based therapies. When multiple new antibodies are discovered against the whole antigen, their epitopes and, therefore, potential novelty and mechanism of action are usually unknown Site-directed mutagenesis, the routine method for epitope mapping, requires testing a large number of mutants since any part of the antigen can potentially form an epitope The goal of this proposal is developing methodology and software for the accurate computational prediction of discontinuous B-cell epitopes based on the structure of an antigen and the structure or sequence of an antibody. Our starting point is PIPER, a protein-protein docking program licensed by Acpharis from Boston University. PIPER is the docking engine in the software packages BioLuminate by Schrodinger and the CyrusBench Suite of Cyrus Biotechnology, as well as in the public server ClusPro. PIPER has a special option for antibody-antigen docking, and has been used for epitope prediction. However, in its present form the software generally results in a high number of putative epitopes, and more accurate prediction requires substantial experimental efforts, e.g., by site-directed mutagenesis. We will modify PIPER to maximize the information available from the docking by generating a large ensemble of low energy docked structures and calculating a contact map rather than discrete docked structures. The number of potential epitopes will be further reduced by a template-based approach based on vector contact maps to characterize antibody-antigen interfaces. We also explore predicting the epitope based on models of the CDR regions. Generating large ensembles of docked structures with a large variety of CDR conformations will reduce the sensitivity of the method to inevitable modeling and docking uncertainty. By increasing the reliability of the predicted epitopes, we expect to reduce or even to eliminate the need for mutagenesis experiments. Finally, we will develop a machine- learning algorithm for the mapping of amino acid composition of CDR regions into epitope composition, a method that can be used when only the antibody sequence available and structure prediction is uncertain due to the lack of suitable templates. When multiple new antibodies are discovered against a whole antigen, their epitopes and, therefore, potential novelty and mechanism of action are usually unknown. Computational software tools can significantly reduce experimental efforts required for epitope determination by guiding experimental efforts toward most probable epitope locations. We propose new computational capabilities based on protein-protein docking and machine learning, which are specifically designed to improve the accuracy of epitope prediction.",Software for Antibody Epitope Prediction,9845171,R43GM134769,"['Address', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Binding Sites', 'Antibody Therapy', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Base Sequence', 'Biotechnology', 'Boston', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Docking', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes', 'Goals', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutagenesis', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Scheme', 'Site-Directed Mutagenesis', 'Software Tools', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'Surface Antigens', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'Universities', 'Vertebral column', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mutant', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'vector']",NIGMS,"ACPHARIS, INC.",R43,2019,149999,-0.007572535245790163
"Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics Microbial population genetic research has been crucial for understanding pathogen dynamics, virulence, host specificity, and many other topics; in many cases uncovering unexpected and transformative biological processes. However, conventional population genetic analyses are limited by the quantity of sequence data from each sample. The temporal, spatial, and evolutionary resolution of techniques that rely on single gene sequences or multi-locus sequence typing are often insufficient to study biological processes on fine scales, precisely the scales at which many evolutionary and mechanistic process occur. Population genomics offers a vast quantity of sequence information for inferring evolutionary and ecological processes on very fine spatial and temporal scales, inferences that are critical to understanding and eventually controlling many infectious diseases. The promise of population genomics is tempered, however, by difficulties in isolating and preparing microbes for next-generation sequencing. We have developed the selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) technology to sequence microbial genomes from complex biological specimens without relying on labor-intensive laboratory culture, even if the focal microbial genome constitutes only a miniscule fraction of the natural sample. The primary hindrance to popular adoption of SWGA for microbial genomic studies is not its effectiveness in producing samples suitable for next-generation sequencing but in the upfront investment needed to develop an effective protocol to amplify the genome of a specific microbial species. Identifying an SWGA protocol that consistently results in selective and even amplification across the target genome is currently hindered by computationally-inefficient software that can evaluate a very limited set of the potentially effective solutions. Further, this software uses marginally-effective optimality criteria as there is currently only a limited understanding of the true criteria that result in highly-selective and even amplification of a target genome. As a result, SWGA protocol development is currently costly in both time and resources. A primary goal of the proposed research is to identify the criteria that result in optimal SWGA by analyzing next- generation sequencing data with advanced machine learning techniques. These optimality criteria will be integrated into a freely-available, computationally-efficient swga development program that will reduce the upfront investment in SWGA protocol development, thus allowing researchers to address medically- and biologically-important questions in any microbial species. In the near term, this project will also generate effective SWGA protocols for four microbial species which can be used immediately to address fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, disease progression, and emerging infectious disease dynamics. From a global disease perspective, this work is imperative as the majority of microbial species cannot easily be cultured and are in danger of becoming bystanders in the genomics revolution that is currently elucidating evolutionary processes and molecular mechanisms in cultivable microbial species. Addressing many of the major outstanding questions about pathogen evolution will require analyses of populations of microbial genomes. Although population genomic studies would provide the analytical resolution to investigate evolutionary and mechanistic processes on fine spatial and temporal scales – precisely the scales at which these processes occur – microbial population genomic research is currently hindered by the practicalities of obtaining sufficient quantities of genomes to analyze. We propose to develop an innovative, cost-effective, practical, and publically-available technology to collect sufficient quantities of microbial genomic DNA necessary for next-generation microbial genome sequencing.",Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics,9699440,R21AI137433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratory culture', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genome Sequencing', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protocol development', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,186101,0.005877398472056047

"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9766330,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'competitive environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2019,468098,-0.008453464806944661
"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases. However, our understanding of the downstream functional effects of splicing in a majority of cases is rudimentary. To address this issue, we will develop a toolbox of robust, multiplexable Cas-based splicing factors to offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional consequences of alternative splicing. that can determine in a single step both the identity of proteins bound to a And 3) There is a paucity of methods specific RNA and their location on that RNA. The development of such an approach will enable us to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins on specific RNAs to dissect their dynamic deposition in range of RNA processes such as transcription, 3ʹ-end and micro-RNA processing, and lncRNA function. To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci. These research goals fully align with the NIGMS 5 Year Strategic Plan, through the development of essential research tools to study and RNA function for biomedical research. Project Narrative RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas proteins offer an unprecedented opportunity to precisely manipulate RNA biology in ways not currently possible. We propose several innovative approaches to address critical knowledge gaps in CRISPR-Cas tool development and chart a path to use these tools to interrogate several fundamental questions in RNA biology. Our approaches will help us define the gRNA design rules for RNA-targeting Cas proteins, and develop robust new RNA-targeting Cas tools to manipulate RNA splicing and dissect protein- RNA interaction networks, and ultimately, the tools developed here will transform the way we study RNA and will broadly impact the fields of molecular and cell biology.",Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology,9796943,R35GM133462,"['Address', 'Alternative Splicing', 'BCAR1 gene', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Floods', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Guide RNA', 'Health', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microprocessor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Transcript', 'base', 'clinical application', 'design', 'innovation', 'knock-down', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'programs', 'single cell analysis', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'virtual']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R35,2019,385000,0.06256434514078892
"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many RNA species within a cell are spatially localized and locally translated into proteins, and previous studies in embryos, neurons and highly-dynamic tissues have demonstrated the vital importance of RNA subcellular location in development and cellular function. However, it has been challenging to study localization transcriptome-wide, which has hampered understanding of the extent and role of such processes in normal and diseased tissues. The proposed work will improve a newly-developed tool for the RNA community to investigate spatial transcriptomics, and use it to provide new insights into RNA biology by determining the regulatory sequences (i.e. the grammar) controlling localization, as well as identifying the associated cellular mechanisms.",Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling,9870316,K99HG010910,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Biological Transport', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterochromatin', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Motors', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Envelope', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Pore', 'Organelles', 'Outer Mitochondrial Membrane', 'Pattern', 'Peroxidases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Transport', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'active control', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'cell fixation', 'cell type', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education resources', 'experience', 'gene function', 'genomic tools', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanometer', 'neuropathology', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'ribosome profiling', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2019,137214,0.03071120479604858
"The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses Abstract: RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has established itself as the primary method for studying transcription in basic research, with an emerging role in the clinic – currently upwards of 5,000 publications using the technology are indexed in PubMed. However, the interpretation of RNA-Seq requires several complex operations including alignment, quantification, normalization and statistical analyses of various types. Since its inception a large number of algorithms have appeared for each step, creating a very confusing landscape for investigators. In order to determine the best analysis practices, numerous benchmarking studies have emerged which leverage real RNA-Seq data made from well-studied RNA samples, such as the Genetic European Variation in Health and Disease (GEUVADIS) consortium data. These valuable RNA-Seq datasets contain the biases and errors introduced by sequencing biochemistry—factors that any analysis method must account for and overcome. However, the utility of such datasets for benchmarking analysis methods is limited by the fact that we do not know the underlying truth (e.g. the true number of RNA molecules from each transcript in the original sample). Therefore researchers tend to rely heavily on simulated data, since we know everything about the true composition of these samples. There are dozens of DNA simulators aimed at benchmarking applications such as variant calling. And while the need for simulators is just as strong in RNA analysis, there are only a scant few RNA-Seq simulators available. Furthermore, the available RNA- Seq simulators are based on simplifying assumptions that greatly restrict their utility for benchmarking anything but the most upstream steps in the analysis pipeline (e.g. alignment). The further downstream the analysis method is, the more accurately the true nature of real data and its technical biases need to be modeled in order to draw meaningful conclusions. For example, no simulator generates data from a diploid genome, which would be necessary to evaluate allele specific quantification. Given our extensive experience with RNA-Seq analysis and transcriptomics in general, and our success at building the BEERS simulator, and our track record of authorship on all comprehensive RNA-Seq aligner benchmarking studies published to date, we are ideally situated to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator which aims to model all sources of technical variability. Furthermore, the simulator will model biological variability with an empirical approach based on using real data to configure the simulator’s parameters, which is a natural problem for machine learning. There are eleven steps in RNA-Seq library preparation which introduce bias, all of which will be modeled by the software in an object-oriented modular framework. Project Narrative: There have been many algorithms developed for every step of the RNA-Seq analysis pipeline with no easy way to compare between them. Simulated data are useful for this purpose, but to date there are very few RNA-Seq simulators available and all make too many simplifying assumptions to be used for anything but the most upstream steps in the pipeline, e.g. alignment. We propose to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator, which will capture all of the biochemical processes in a modular fashion and model all of the sources of technical variation.",The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses,9730605,R21LM012763,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Authorship', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'European', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequencing Biochemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'indexing', 'next generation', 'open source', 'operation', 'power analysis', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,181125,0.004431077750606589
"High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Glycosylation fulfills important physiological functions, including protein folding, embryogenesis, cell adhesion, pathogen recognition, and immune response. The multifaceted roles glycosylation plays derive from the presence of a range of glycan epitopes, where a small structural variation can have a profound impact on functions. Further, a glycome consists of many closely related structures, with their relative amounts determined by metabolic conditions in a cell- and growth-specific manner. Altered glycosylation is linked to many diseases, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Thus, there is a clear need for analytical methods that can rapidly identify and quantify the many glycoforms in a glycome from different health and disease states. Finally, no genome-predicted glycan database exists due to the unscripted nature of glycan biosynthesis, and discovery of new glycan structures must be achieved by de novo methods. Although tandem mass spectrometry-based biopolymer sequencing has been the major catalyst to the recent rapid advance of 'omics, the prevailing collisionally activated dissociation method often fails to provide sufficient glycan structural detail at the MS2 level, whereas the MSn approach lacks the speed, sensitivity, and quantitative potential for high-throughput glycome analysis. We have recently developed an electronic excitation dissociation (EED) method that can yield rich structural information in a single stage of MS/MS analysis. However, the impact of EED on glycomics research is currently limited by its poor accessibility, insufficient coupling to on-line glycan separation methods, and difficulty in interpretation of complex glycan EED tandem mass spectra. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach that combines EED with on-line liquid chromatography (LC) separation and a novel bioinformatics tool to achieve high-throughput, de novo, and comprehensive glycome characterization. We will explore the potential of EED for analysis of glycans in various derivatized forms, study their fragmentation behaviors, and establish fragmentation rules for the development of bioinformatics software. We will optimize conditions for efficient coupling of EED to reversed-phase, and porous graphitic carbon LC, and develop an LC-EED-MS/MS approach for simultaneous characterization and quantitation of glycan mixtures. We will implement EED on a Q-TOF instrument to improve its access to the glycoscience community. Finally, we will develop and rigorously test the performance of a novel bioinformatics software that can rapidly and accurately determine each glycan's structure from its tandem MS spectra. The proposed algorithm is fundamentally different from most existing software, in that it no longer relies solely on glycosidic and cross-ring fragments for topology and linkage analysis, but rather adopts a machine learning approach that considers the contexts of various types of fragment peaks, and the spectral features associated with different linkage configurations and structural motifs. The availability of such a high-throughput, de novo glycan sequencing tool will have an immense impact on many biomedical research fields, as glycosylation plays critical roles in almost all biological pathways. High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Project narrative Characterization of glycans from biological sources requires sensitive and high-throughput analytical methods that can separate and identify each glycoform in a complex mixture. We propose to develop an HPLC-EED- MS/MS method for comprehensive glycome characterization.

"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter).

In addition, due to the recent success of FDA-approved splicing modulators like Nusinersen, along with fascinating pre- clinical results underlining the importance of AS as therapeutic targets; splicing research has become of major interest to pharmaceutical companies. Envisagenics is developing SpliceCoreTM, an innovative cloud-based software platform using biomedical big data for AS analysis to discover new therapies and biomarkers for complex diseases. Our breakthrough platform combines algorithms and databases developed and experimentally validated at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL): SpliceTrapTM, for the detection of splicing activity using RNA-seq data; SpliceDuoTM, for the identification of significant splicing variation across biological samples; SpliceImpact2TM, for the prioritization of biologically relevant AS variants with therapeutic potential; and TXdbTM, a splicing isoform database that connects client’s proprietary data to public repositories such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Thanks to the Phase I award SpliceCore was adapted as a cloud-based software, accelerating scalability and adaptation to the fast- evolving market of biomedical Big Data. We now have deployed SpliceCore’s back-end on three cloud-service providers, increased its overall run-time by a factor of 12, developed tools to discover disease-specific AS isoforms, finalized and tested a machine-learning algorithm to predict the biological impact of AS, and experimentally validated some of our new predictions with a success rate of 82.5%. The goal for Phase II is to accelerate client acquisition through the development of user-interactive applications informed from client’s feedback by substantially expanding the platform’s knowledgebase and predictive functions with novel AS isoforms extracted from ~37,000 public datasets. Thus, a new version of SpliceCore will be developed to predict regulatory interactions between RNA-binding proteins and their RNA targets to assist in the interpretation of aberrant splicing factors through a collaboration with world renowned HHMI Professor Dr. Tom Tuschl from Rockefeller University and developer of Nusinersen, Professor Dr. Adrian Krainer from CSHL. Envisagenics is targeting the global bioinformatics market valued at $4 billion in 2014 with a CAGR of over 21%. SpliceCore could capture ~10% of the market, identify novel drug targets, and design RNA therapeutics from aberrant splicing events prevalent in cancer and a multitude of genetic diseases while increasing the efficiency of R&D in biopharma. Project Narrative In this SBIR Phase II, Envisagenics will advance the development of SpliceCoreTM, a cloud-based software platform for the discovery of drug-targets and biomarkers using biomedical big data. Therapeutic screens are increasingly focusing on Alternative Splicing (AS), a biological process that regulates gene-product structure and function. Strikingly, 50% of genetic diseases described in literature can be triggered by AS errors. The recent FDA approval of RNA-therapeutic compounds to correct AS errors, combined with increasingly available big datasets and groundbreaking cloud-computing provide a unique opportunity for computerized discovery of AS therapeutics. Envisagenics’ technology will help biomedical researchers to translate basic science into new therapeutic products for cancer and genetic diseases. By the completion of this project, we will deploy a user-friendly, secured and scalable SpliceCore software, with new functionalities ready for integration into biopharmaceutical Research & Development workflows.",SpliceCore: A Cloud-Based Software Platform to Translate Alternative Splicing Events into Therapeutic Targets Using RNA-seq Data,9677178,R44GM116478,"['Achievement', 'Advanced Development', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Award', 'Back', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Products', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Client', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud Service', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Drug Targeting', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Face', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Food and Drug Administration Drug Approval', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Imagery', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Prevalence', 'Price', 'Privatization', 'Probability', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protein Splicing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Protein FUS', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribonucleosides', 'Risk', 'Running', 'SRSF2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Services', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'big biomedical data', 'cancer genetics', 'case control', 'cloud based', 'commercial application', 'computerized', 'cost', 'crosslink', 'data mining', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experimental study', 'fascinate', 'flexibility', 'gene product', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'petabyte', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'professor', 'repository', 'research and development', 'service providers', 'success', 'system architecture', 'targeted biomarker', 'therapeutic RNA', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,"ENVISAGENICS, INC.",R44,2019,517226,0.005612918266156216
"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills. NARRATIVE  Every animal's life starts by a drastic and controlled remodeling of gene expression following the fertilization of the egg by the sperm. Interestingly, I have developed new tools to study the controllers mediating this essential transfer of information.

"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes Project Summary RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular “hijackers”.

"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.

"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Although MDS is used as the prototype of disease for this proposal, the system developed will be applicable to multiple diseases with complex phenotypes.",Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions,9751927,R01GM123037,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'gene function', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'learning network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2019,302225,-0.00016833722813422534

"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9597237,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web server', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2019,343124,-0.009084831696800851
"Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in regulatory genomics, especially 3D genome organization in cell nucleus, suggest that existing methods for cross-species comparisons are limited in their ability to fully understand the evolution of non-coding genome function. In particular, it is known that genomes are compartmentalized to distinct compartments in the nucleus such as nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles. Such nuclear compartmentalization is an essential feature of higher-order genome organization and is linked to various important genome functions such as DNA replication timing and transcription. Unfortunately, to date no study exists that directly compares nuclear compartmentalization between human and other mammals. In addition, there are no computational models available that consider the continuous nature of multiple features of nuclear compartmentalization and function, which is critical to integrate genome-wide functional genomic data and datasets that measure cytological distance to multiple compartments across species. In this project, we will develop novel algorithms and generate new datasets to directly address two key questions: (1) How to identify the evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization? (2) What types of sequence evolution may drive spatial localization changes across species? The proposed project represents the first endeavor in comparative genomics for nuclear compartmentalization. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Developing new probabilistic models for identifying evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization. (2) Identifying genome-wide evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization in primate species based on TSA-seq and Repli-seq. (3) Developing new algorithms to connect sequence features to nuclear compartmentalization through cross-species comparisons. Successful completion of these aims will result in novel computational tools and new datasets that will be highly valuable for the comparative genomics community. Integrating the new computational tools and unique datasets will provide invaluable insights into the relationship between sequence evolution and changes in nuclear genome organization in mammalian species. Therefore, the proposed research is expected to advance comparative genomics to a new frontier and provide new perspectives for studying human genome function PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the outcome of the project is expected to enhance the analyses of nuclear genome organizations across primate species to better understand genome function and human biology.

"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9759968,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2019,321795,0.002349650830365011
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9774233,R01GM123314,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Location', 'MALAT1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Running', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive tools', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2019,303137,0.005703529489897519
"Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human biology and disease. High throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) is making it possible to survey the expressed genes and their alternative splicing variations in a wide variety of cellular conditions. However, the short reads are challenging to analyze, demanding highly sophisticated computational methods that can extract meaningful AS information efficiently, accurately, and in a comprehensive way. While there has been great progress so far, current methods based on assembling the short reads into transcript annotations have reached a plateau. We propose two innovations that can help overcome the limits. The first is one-step simultaneous analyses of multiple samples in an RNA-seq collection, in contrast with the current two-step approach that analyzes each sample separately and then merges the results. The second is to create and interrogate assembly-free representations of AS. The project will design a suite of tools that will leverage the latent information in large collections of samples and from heterogeneous data types to build complete and accurate AS signatures of tissues and cell types, and to elucidate the regulatory circuitry of AS and its functional implications. Aim 1 will develop a high- performance multi-sample transcript assembly tool, combining subexon graph representations of genes and AS variations, statistical methods for improved feature detection, and search space reduction techniques for efficient sample processing. Aim 2 will build highly efficient and accurate feature selection tools to detect and characterize assembly-free AS variations (subexons and introns), simultaneously from collections of RNA-seq samples. It will combine novel regularized programs with complex models of intronic `noise' and other RNA-seq confounders, and enable analyses of differential splicing and to identify individual and group-specific variations. Lastly, Aim 3 will develop a system to comprehensively model the regulatory and functional circuitry of AS and the effects of mutations, starting from deep learning models of sequences and alignments and integrating expression, sequence, epigenetic and mutation data across tissues, cell types and conditions. We will rigorously test and evaluate all tools in simulations and on large public data sets, as well as on thyroid and head and neck cancer data provided by our collaborators, and we will experimentally validate random subsets of predictions with capillary electrophoresis and qRT-PCR. Collectively, the concepts, methods and tools will establish a new framework for analyzing RNA-seq data that can efficiently tackle the `big data' challenges, leading to more complete discovery and annotation of AS structure and function in human health and disease.   NARRATIVE Alternative splicing is a fundamental gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human physiology and disease. Next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is making it possible to characterize alternative splicing in great detail, however, current bioinformatics analysis tools miss important variations. The project will design a suite of innovative tools that criss-cross information across multiple RNA-seq samples, and across heterogeneous sequence, epigenetic and expression data, to more comprehensively and more accurately determine the structure, function and regulation of alternative splicing in human biology and disease.",Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data,9817658,R01GM129085,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Bypass', 'Capillary Electrophoresis', 'Charge', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Farming environment', 'Follicular thyroid carcinoma', 'Galaxy', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Graph', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'International', 'Introns', 'Learning Module', 'Length', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'One-Step dentin bonding system', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spliced Genes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Thyroid carcinoma', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'data reduction', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feature detection', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'prototype', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'simulation', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,363164,-0.023797512513795555
"The Enzymatic Reader Project Summary At this point in time, it is generally understood and agreed upon that single-molecule sequencing (SMS) is the future of genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and epitranscriptomics due to its significant advantages over other technologies and methods. However, in order for these advantages to be fully realized, and for SMS to become the “gold standard” sequencing approach, significant issues and hurdles must be solved and overcome. During this program, Electronic BioSciences, Inc. (EBS) aims to demonstrate a completely new and enabling SMS method that will possess the ability to directly and correctly identify individual nucleotides, including chemically modified nucleotides. During this project, we will both demonstrate the ability of this entirely new sequencing approach to sequence DNA with high accuracy (directly comparing the obtained accuracy, throughput, error mechanisms and associated rates to other SMS approaches) and correctly identify (and sequence) 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and its derivatives, at the single molecule level. At the conclusion of this Phase I project, we will have successfully demonstrated an entirely new and dramatically improved SMS approach, and reduced the associated risks involved with its full future commercial developments. There is a current need within the field of next generation sequencing (NGS) or so called third generation sequencing (TGS) for new, enabling instrumentation that is capable of high-accuracy, direct, native DNA sequencing, including the ability to correctly identify canonical and modified bases, homopolymer stretches, and sequence repeats. The entirely new SMS methodology that will be developed during this project will overcome known hurdles and limitations of currently available NGS, TGS, and SMS technologies, resulting in technology that is cost-efficient, highly accurate, easy to setup and utilize, capable of de novo sequencing and modified base calling, and yields highly simplistic data for easy analysis and post possessing. Through significant advancements made during this program, this resulting technology will revolutionize the use of the genome and epigenome, radically change standard R&D and clinical practices, and greatly advance clinical diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutic decision making. Project Narrative The novel single-molecule sequencing (SMS) technology developed during this project will enable high- accuracy, direct, native DNA sequencing, including the ability to correctly identify canonical and modified bases, homopolymer stretches, and sequence repeats via a cost-efficient and easy-to-use methodology. The impact of these advances in SMS will eventually enable wide-scale, routine clinical care and diagnostics toward advanced precision medicine, not just R&D.

"Probing transcriptional activation at the molecular level Project abstract Much of the assembly process of the transcription machinery is governed by transient and dynamic protein‐ protein interactions (PPIs) that defy standard characterization strategies. Transcriptional coactivators are the hubs of this process, interacting with transcriptional activators, epigenetic modulators, the polymerase, and other coactivators to assemble the transcriptional machine. Coactivators also represent a central molecular recognition conundrum, as the mechanisms by which they interact with such a diverse array with binding partners and the influence of local binding interactions on longer‐range structural and functional trajectories. In the previous funding period, we developed a molecular recognition model that addresses the first part of the conundrum. Here will build on this model to discover allosteric modulators of coactivators previously labelled undruggable despite their central functional roles. Additionally, we will answer the latter half of the conundrum to develop a comprehensive model of molecular recognition in transcriptional coactivator function. Project narrative Transcription is dysregulated in every human disease as either a cause or an effect and as such represents a potentially powerful intervention point for therapeutics; a significant impediment to progress are the many questions regarding the complex network of protein‐protein interactions that regulates this process. In this research plan we implement a combination of chemical biology tools and approaches to define key binding interactions and conformational changes that produce function in vitro and in cells.

"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection.

"Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data Big data is now ubiquitous in every field of modern scientific research. Many contemporary applications, such as the recent national microbiome initiative (NMI), greatly demand highly flexible statistical machine learning methods that can produce both interpretable and reproducible results. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify crucial causal factors that are responsible for the response from a large number of available covariates, which can be statistically formulated as the false discovery rate (FDR) control in general high-dimensional nonlinear models. Despite the enormous applications of shotgun metagenomic studies, most existing investigations concentrate on the study of bacterial organisms. However, viruses and virus-host interactions play important roles in controlling the functions of the microbial communities. In addition, viruses have been shown to be associated with complex diseases. Yet, investigations into the roles of viruses in human diseases are significantly underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to develop mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches to deal with highly complex big data and the applications of these approaches to solve fundamental and important biological and biomedical problems. There are four interrelated aims. In Aim 1, we will theoretically investigate the power of the recently proposed model-free knockoffs (MFK) procedure, which has been theoretically justified to control FDR in arbitrary models and arbitrary dimensions. We will also theoretically justify the robustness of MFK with respect to the misspecification of covariate distribution. These studies will lay the foundations for our developments in other aims. In Aim 2, we will develop deep learning approaches to predict viral contigs with higher accuracy, integrate our new algorithm with MFK to achieve FDR control for virus motif discovery, and investigate the power and robustness of our new procedure. In Aim 3, we will take into account the virus-host motif interactions and adapt our algorithms and theories in Aim 2 for predicting virus-host infectious interaction status. In Aim 4, we will apply the developed methods from the first three aims to analyze the shotgun metagenomics data sets in ExperimentHub to identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with several diseases at some target FDR level. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for metagenomics studies under a variety of environments. Big data is ubiquitous in biological research. Identifying causal factors associated with complex diseases or traits from big data is highly important and challenging. New statistical and computational tools will be developed to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) for molecular sequence data based on the novel model-free knockoffs framework.

"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents. The access to these custom reagents will accelerate biomedical research and clinical diagnostics.",Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation,9579149,R01GM129313,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Carbohydrates', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Chinese Hamster Ovary Cell', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Engineering', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'In Vitro', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nucleotides', 'Opioid', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Reagent', 'Reproducibility', 'SLEB2 gene', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'System', 'Testing', 'Tyrosine', 'Work', 'aptamer', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'functional group', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'novel', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'success', 'virtual']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,314000,0.01616501530296137

"Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics Microbial population genetic research has been crucial for understanding pathogen dynamics, virulence, host specificity, and many other topics; in many cases uncovering unexpected and transformative biological processes. However, conventional population genetic analyses are limited by the quantity of sequence data from each sample. The temporal, spatial, and evolutionary resolution of techniques that rely on single gene sequences or multi-locus sequence typing are often insufficient to study biological processes on fine scales, precisely the scales at which many evolutionary and mechanistic process occur. Population genomics offers a vast quantity of sequence information for inferring evolutionary and ecological processes on very fine spatial and temporal scales, inferences that are critical to understanding and eventually controlling many infectious diseases. The promise of population genomics is tempered, however, by difficulties in isolating and preparing microbes for next-generation sequencing. We have developed the selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) technology to sequence microbial genomes from complex biological specimens without relying on labor-intensive laboratory culture, even if the focal microbial genome constitutes only a miniscule fraction of the natural sample. The primary hindrance to popular adoption of SWGA for microbial genomic studies is not its effectiveness in producing samples suitable for next-generation sequencing but in the upfront investment needed to develop an effective protocol to amplify the genome of a specific microbial species. Identifying an SWGA protocol that consistently results in selective and even amplification across the target genome is currently hindered by computationally-inefficient software that can evaluate a very limited set of the potentially effective solutions. Further, this software uses marginally-effective optimality criteria as there is currently only a limited understanding of the true criteria that result in highly-selective and even amplification of a target genome. As a result, SWGA protocol development is currently costly in both time and resources. A primary goal of the proposed research is to identify the criteria that result in optimal SWGA by analyzing next- generation sequencing data with advanced machine learning techniques. These optimality criteria will be integrated into a freely-available, computationally-efficient swga development program that will reduce the upfront investment in SWGA protocol development, thus allowing researchers to address medically- and biologically-important questions in any microbial species. In the near term, this project will also generate effective SWGA protocols for four microbial species which can be used immediately to address fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, disease progression, and emerging infectious disease dynamics. From a global disease perspective, this work is imperative as the majority of microbial species cannot easily be cultured and are in danger of becoming bystanders in the genomics revolution that is currently elucidating evolutionary processes and molecular mechanisms in cultivable microbial species. Addressing many of the major outstanding questions about pathogen evolution will require analyses of populations of microbial genomes. Although population genomic studies would provide the analytical resolution to investigate evolutionary and mechanistic processes on fine spatial and temporal scales – precisely the scales at which these processes occur – microbial population genomic research is currently hindered by the practicalities of obtaining sufficient quantities of genomes to analyze. We propose to develop an innovative, cost-effective, practical, and publically-available technology to collect sufficient quantities of microbial genomic DNA necessary for next-generation microbial genome sequencing.",Selective Whole Genome Amplification - Enabling Microbial Population Genomics,9507167,R21AI137433,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Coupling', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Effectiveness', 'Emerging Communicable Diseases', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genes', 'Genetic Research', 'Genome', 'Genomic DNA', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratory culture', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Microbial Genome Sequencing', 'Microsatellite Repeats', 'Molecular', 'Organism', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Genetics', 'Process', 'Program Development', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Virulence', 'Work', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'design', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'host-microbe interactions', 'improved', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'microbial genome', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'prevent', 'protocol development', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2018,242837,0.005877398472056047
"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9531422,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2018,468098,-0.008453464806944661
"Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance SUMMARY:  The goal of this proposal is to improve the sensitivity and specificity of the Spinach-based splice sensor platform by developing a novel multiprobe (MP) assay design and a companion machine learning-based classification algorithm called assay classifier engine (ACE). Improvement in sensitivity and specificity of the splice sensor platform enables its application to detect endogenous RNA isoforms with low copy number and distinguish alternative RNA isoforms that share high degree of sequence similarities.  The aim of any assay development effort is to achieve excellent assay specificity and sensitivity. However, this is often a futile endeavor since specificity and sensitivity are two inversely correlated factors. The underlying reason for poor sensitivity or specificity is due to the off-target signals generated by competing molecules present in the sample. In the field of diagnostics, one of the ways these issues are addressed is to perform multiple single probe testing instead of one single probe testing. While individual singe probe assays might have poor specificity and sensitivity, when combined, these assays synergistically improve the sensitivity and specificity of the ultimate diagnostic determination. In the field of research and drug discovery, researchers have employed a multitude of strategies (e.g. signal amplification, reaction cascades, or sample enrichment) to improve sensitivity and MP design or strand displacement strategies to improve specificity. Some of the PCR- based methods have combined both enzyme-based signal amplification and MP strategies to improve assay determination. However, when it comes to detecting targets that are highly similar to their competitors, such as detecting single nucleotide polymorphism, DNA methylation, RNA modification and alternative splicing, there is still an unmet need for more sensitive and specific analytical methods.  In the past few years, Lucerna has developed Spinach-based sensors to detect intractable metabolites and biomolecules. One such sensor is the splice sensor, which is a Spinach-based sensor that can generate fluorescence signal based on the alternative RNA isoform of interest. One of the challenges encountered during splice sensor assay development is the lack of sensitivity toward low copy number RNA isoforms and low specificity when distinguishing two splice isoforms that share a high sequence similarity. To overcome this challenge in this proposal, we will develop a MP assay panel comprised of splice sensor variants that recognize the target RNA and the competitor with varying binding affinities and differing signal responses. We will use data sets generated from the MP assay to train a ML-based ACE algorithm to make target determination in test samples. Further, we will develop a quantitative MP data set and re-train the ACE algorithm to classify the assay signals into various categories based on target concentrations in the test sample. This new ACE algorithm will then be tested against conventional single probe assays to determine specificity and sensitivity improvement of the MP assay platform. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Improved specificity and sensitivity are highly sought-after features in assays where there are high similarity between the target and its competitors or when the target exists naturally in very low abundance. To address this unmet need, we will develop a fluorescence sensor-based multiprobe assay approach and a companion machine learning-based assay classifier engine (ACE). The ACE algorithm will integrate the multiprobe assay data and classify them based on trained machine learning models to make sample determination with enhanced specificity, sensitivity, and dynamic range than possible with conventional single probe assays.",Assay Classifier Engine (ACE) for enhancing splice sensor assay performance,9622514,R43GM130258,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Area Under Curve', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Companions', 'Custom', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nucleotides', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Reaction', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Specificity', 'Spinach - dietary', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Training', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'aptamer', 'assay development', 'base', 'cost', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'response', 'sensor', 'targeted biomarker']",NIGMS,"LUCERNA, INC.",R43,2018,224925,0.009490624490645586

"The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses Abstract: RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has established itself as the primary method for studying transcription in basic research, with an emerging role in the clinic – currently upwards of 5,000 publications using the technology are indexed in PubMed. However, the interpretation of RNA-Seq requires several complex operations including alignment, quantification, normalization and statistical analyses of various types. Since its inception a large number of algorithms have appeared for each step, creating a very confusing landscape for investigators. In order to determine the best analysis practices, numerous benchmarking studies have emerged which leverage real RNA-Seq data made from well-studied RNA samples, such as the Genetic European Variation in Health and Disease (GEUVADIS) consortium data. These valuable RNA-Seq datasets contain the biases and errors introduced by sequencing biochemistry—factors that any analysis method must account for and overcome. However, the utility of such datasets for benchmarking analysis methods is limited by the fact that we do not know the underlying truth (e.g. the true number of RNA molecules from each transcript in the original sample). Therefore researchers tend to rely heavily on simulated data, since we know everything about the true composition of these samples. There are dozens of DNA simulators aimed at benchmarking applications such as variant calling. And while the need for simulators is just as strong in RNA analysis, there are only a scant few RNA-Seq simulators available. Furthermore, the available RNA- Seq simulators are based on simplifying assumptions that greatly restrict their utility for benchmarking anything but the most upstream steps in the analysis pipeline (e.g. alignment). The further downstream the analysis method is, the more accurately the true nature of real data and its technical biases need to be modeled in order to draw meaningful conclusions. For example, no simulator generates data from a diploid genome, which would be necessary to evaluate allele specific quantification. Given our extensive experience with RNA-Seq analysis and transcriptomics in general, and our success at building the BEERS simulator, and our track record of authorship on all comprehensive RNA-Seq aligner benchmarking studies published to date, we are ideally situated to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator which aims to model all sources of technical variability. Furthermore, the simulator will model biological variability with an empirical approach based on using real data to configure the simulator’s parameters, which is a natural problem for machine learning. There are eleven steps in RNA-Seq library preparation which introduce bias, all of which will be modeled by the software in an object-oriented modular framework. Project Narrative: There have been many algorithms developed for every step of the RNA-Seq analysis pipeline with no easy way to compare between them. Simulated data are useful for this purpose, but to date there are very few RNA-Seq simulators available and all make too many simplifying assumptions to be used for anything but the most upstream steps in the pipeline, e.g. alignment. We propose to develop the next generation of open-source RNA-Seq simulator, which will capture all of the biochemical processes in a modular fashion and model all of the sources of technical variation.",The next generation of RNA-Seq simulators for benchmarking analyses,9600808,R21LM012763,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Authorship', 'Basic Science', 'Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diploidy', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'European', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'In Vitro', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Nature', 'Output', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'PubMed', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequencing Biochemistry', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'Work', 'analog', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'indexing', 'next generation', 'open source', 'operation', 'power analysis', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2018,217350,0.004431077750606589

Camelids, including llamas, camels, and alpacas, produce a unique repertoire of antibodies that includes both dual chain antibodies and single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies, due to their comparative structural simplicity, are simpler to express and develop at the scale required for therapeutics. In addition, single chain antibodies are able to bind to small epitopes, such as enzyme active sites, that would be hidden to larger, dual chain antibodies. The binding domain of the single chain antibody may be small enough to infiltrate traditionally difficult to access tissues, including crossing the blood-brain barrier.  Current approaches to single chain antibody discovery require the collection of cells that encode the antibody genes, including memory B cells and plasma cells. Target-specific antibodies are selected after the antibody transcripts are cloned into a display system, such as phage or yeast. While memory B cells and plasma cells represent only a minute fraction of the cells located in peripheral blood, target- specific antibodies are present in high concentration in blood after an infection. Each plasma cell can secrete thousands of antibodies per minute. Digital Proteomics is developing Alicanto, a technology that utilizes the antibodies circulating in blood to identify target-specific antibodies.  Alicanto integrates two sources of information about the antibody repertoire. First, Alicanto constructs a database of potential antigen-specific antibodies by performing next-generation sequencing of antibody transcripts. Next, Alicanto enriches for target-specific antibodies from the blood using affinity chromatography and subjects the antibodies to tandem mass spectrometry. Finally, Alicanto uses machine learning models to integrate the sequencing and mass spectrometry data to derive a collection of target-specific antibody candidates. For single chain antibody discovery, Alicanto will use specialized primers and enrichment techniques to isolate only the subset of the antibody repertoire that contains the single chain antibodies. Alicanto will be used to discover high affinity, single chain antibodies for development as therapeutic molecules. Antibodies are produced natively in humans to fight disease and the molecules have garnered significant attention due to their therapeutic potential. Single-chain antibodies, which are smaller than conventional antibodies, represent a new frontier for antibody-based therapeutics due to their ability to target molecular surfaces that would be hidden to larger antibodies, as well as the relative simplicity of their development. Digital Proteomics is developing Alicanto to discover single-chain antibodies in llama that can be developed into human therapies.",Alicanto:  Proteogenomic discovery of single chain antibodies in llama,9622824,R43AI141046,"['Active Sites', 'Adaptive Immune System', 'Address', 'Affinity', 'Affinity Chromatography', 'Alpaca', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antibody Therapy', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigens', 'Aspirate substance', 'Attention', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B cell repertoire', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bacteriophages', 'Binding', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Bone Marrow', 'Brain', 'Camels', 'Cations', 'Cell Fraction', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Cloning', 'Collection', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'G-substrate', 'Gel', 'Genes', 'Genus staphylococcus', 'Homo', 'Human', 'Immunization', 'Immunization Schedule', 'Industry Standard', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Llama', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Memory B-Lymphocyte', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Organism', 'Oryctolagus cuniculus', 'Pharmacodynamics', 'Plasma Cells', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Serum', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spleen', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Venoms', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'Yeasts', 'antibody engineering', 'biophysical properties', 'comparative', 'design', 'digital', 'dimer', 'fighting', 'frontier', 'melting', 'nanobodies', 'neglected tropical diseases', 'next generation sequencing', 'peripheral blood', 'polypeptide', 'preference', 'proteogenomics', 'response', 'sample collection', 'screening', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'therapeutic candidate', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,"DIGITAL PROTEOMICS, LLC",R43,2018,170108,-4.990511436635666e-05
"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,9543037,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2018,310328,-0.018130290223208785
"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills. NARRATIVE  Every animal's life starts by a drastic and controlled remodeling of gene expression following the fertilization of the egg by the sperm. Interestingly, I have developed new tools to study the controllers mediating this essential transfer of information. The objective of this work is to discover all the regulators and the ways they interact one with each other to generate a fully-grown organism because it will ultimately help to understand human development and disease.",Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development,9431679,K99HD093873,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Appointment', 'Autoimmunity', 'Award', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Code', 'Computer Analysis', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Educational workshop', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Fertilization', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maternal Messenger RNA', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Monitor', 'Oocytes', 'Organism', 'Play', 'Polyribosomes', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Prothrombin', 'RNA', 'RNA Conformation', 'RNA Helicase', 'RNA Probes', 'Reader', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Reporter Genes', 'Research', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Virus', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'analog', 'career', 'egg', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'mRNA Decay', 'mRNA Stability', 'mutant', 'nervous system disorder', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'programs', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'tenure track', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NICHD,YALE UNIVERSITY,K99,2018,115350,-0.01892486441135994
"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9535392,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'human disease', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2018,552994,0.08019005674039666
"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs). Although MDS is used as the prototype of disease for this proposal, the system developed will be applicable to multiple diseases with complex phenotypes.",Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions,9565604,R01GM123037,"['Achievement', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Breast', 'CD34 gene', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chronic Disease', 'Code', 'Colorectal', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dysmyelopoietic Syndromes', 'Embryonic Development', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Growth', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hematopoietic stem cells', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Network-based', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'base', 'chromatin modification', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'gene function', 'genomic data', 'high throughput technology', 'learning network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'protein function', 'protein protein interaction', 'prototype', 'scaffold', 'software development', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,R01,2018,302225,-0.00016833722813422534
"SpliceCore: A Cloud-Based Software Platform to Translate Alternative Splicing Events into Therapeutic Targets Using RNA-seq Data Abstract Over 30 million people in the US suffer from genetic diseases or cancers caused by mutations of which ~15% disrupt the regulation of splicing. Alternative splicing (AS) errors have been reported in literature to drive 370 genetic diseases out of ~800 described to date. In addition, due to the recent success of FDA-approved splicing modulators like Nusinersen, along with fascinating pre- clinical results underlining the importance of AS as therapeutic targets; splicing research has become of major interest to pharmaceutical companies.

"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9382895,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2018,329119,-0.009084831696800851
"Novel Nanopore-based RNA Sequencing using Nucleobase-specific Tags Project Summary Cost-effective, and accurate sequencing of RNA, composed of both canonical and modified bases, of any length, without conversion to cDNA, and without amplification are the objectives of this project, and the ultimate goal is to sequence the transcriptome, and determine in a time-sensitive manner relative distribution of its components. Such accomplishment will directly impact prevention, diagnosis, and cure of disease and materialize the promise of personalized medicine. Current methods, such as Illumina's RNA-Seq, and the single molecule approaches of Pacific Biosciences and of Oxford Nanopore Technologies, still lag behind in many of the critical attributes mentioned above. The unresolved issue with nanopore-based sequencing is the observation that ion current vs. time recording does not refer to a single nucleobase, but to a short sequence of 4 or more bases. The problem, partially resolved with the use of sophisticated algorithms and learning machines, appears intractable for RNA that includes numerous post-transcriptional base modifications. As an illustration, if a nanopore reads a sequence of 4 bases and the specific RNA to be sequenced has a total of 8 different nucleobases (4 canonical and 4 modified), then 48 = 65,536 signals need to be discriminated from within an ion current range of 20 to 40 pA with a standard deviation of ±1 pA; this is an impossible computational task. However, if the nanopore could sense one base at a time and yield distinct ion current for each base, there will be only 8 different recordings to distinguish from, a much simpler task. Our own published results indicate that oligodeoxynucleotides conjugated with a pyrimidine-specific tag (Osmium tetroxide 2,2'-bipyrimidine or OsBp) yield enzyme-free, slow/readable translocation via α- Hemolysin, and distinct ion current levels for intact, T(OsBp), and C(OsBp) bases, suggesting that a single tag can yield sequencing information on purine, T, and C. The latter leads to the conjecture that the presence of a second, purine-specific, label would allow identification of all four canonical bases. Furthermore each tag has intrinsic selectivity for one base over another, and this will provide a handle for additional discrimination among the modified bases. In this phase I proposal we aim to demonstrate (i) near 100% labeling (true positives) with 0% internucleotide bond cleavage, and 0% false positives for RNA(OsBp), as we have already shown for DNA(OsBp), (ii) comparable labeling attributes for a purine-specific tag, and (iii) readable translocation with single pyrimidine base discrimination for RNA(OsBp). Success in these efforts will lead to single base discrimination and sequencing of RNA, including a number of post-transcriptionally modified bases, and pave the road for sequencing the transcriptome. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Advances in personalized medicine for diagnosis and treatment of disease require sequencing the RNA transcriptome with technologies that are currently unavailable. Nanopore-systems that exhibit single-base discrimination, like the one addressed in this proposal, will allow sequencing the transcriptome in an accurate, timely, and cost-effective manner.",Novel Nanopore-based RNA Sequencing using Nucleobase-specific Tags,9506880,R43HG010051,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Base Sequence', 'Belief', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cells', 'Complementary DNA', 'DNA', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Digit structure', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Exhibits', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Hemolysin', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Osmium Tetroxide', 'Phase', 'Platinum', 'Platinum Compounds', 'Prevention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Purines', 'Pyrimidine', 'Pyrimidines', 'RNA', 'RNA Sequences', 'Readability', 'Residual state', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transfer RNA', 'VDAC1 gene', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'constriction', 'cost effective', 'design', 'improved', 'nanopore', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nucleobase', 'personalized medicine', 'public health relevance', 'sensor', 'single molecule', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,"YENOS ANALYTICAL, LLC",R43,2018,280000,0.042373485495307436
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9595902,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2018,321985,0.002349650830365011
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states.

"Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal since the completion of the Human Genome Project has been to understand all functional elements in the human genome and the role they play in normal biological processes and disease. To that end, large pooled libraries of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents have been developed for genome-wide loss-of-function screens but have been hindered by 3 problems: 1) the incompleteness of protein depletion inherent in partial knock-down; 2) off-target effects from the seed sequence; and 3) genetic elements that are not transcribed are inaccessible to manipulation. Genome engineering using precisely targeted nucleases has emerged as an innovative technology to modify the genome and causally interrogate the role of different functional elements. Recently, I developed a new technology for functional genomic screening using the RNA- guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease (Shalem*, Sanjana*, et al., Science, 2014). Since CRISPR works on the DNA level, it is possible to manipulate non-coding elements that are inaccessible to RNAi. The research goal of this proposal is to develop new biological tools and analysis techniques for functional annotation of non-coding elements using pooled CRISPR screens.  Mentored phase: First, I plan to develop and optimize high-throughput CRISPR non-coding mutagenesis libraries targeting introns, UTRs, promoters, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions to enable screening at high-resolution with megabase-scale coverage. Next, I will validate functional non-coding elements and use this large dataset to find unifying principles of how non-coding elements regulate gene expression. Independent phase: I plan to develop a novel CRISPR architecture for tiled deletion screens capable of deleting many segments over entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. With this technology and the increased screening throughput it enables, I will be able to develop a long-term independent research program in several possible directions, including further genome biology, personalized functional genomics, and predictive diagnostics for drug-genome interactions.  The two primary areas of training needed to help me succeed in my research goals are 1) CRISPR technology development (mentor: Dr. Feng Zhang) and 2) knowledge of human genetics and non-coding variation (mentor: Dr. David Altshuler). Each mentor is an established expert in these fields. My career development plan integrates additional laboratory training, specialized tutorials in human genetics from world experts, local and national presentations of my research, and courses in scientific writing, grantsmanship and job search strategies. To assist with science- and career-related decisions, I have assembled an Advisory Committee with a team of established, senior genomics experts: Drs. Eric Lander, Steven Hyman, and David Root. The Broad Institute is an ideal environment: All Mentors and Advisors are located in one building and there are facilities for high-throughput functional screening in th RNAi Platform (Director: Dr. Root). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to transform our understanding of the human genome by developing a new kind of functional assay capable of directly editing the genome and analyzing how this genome editing impacts the growth, development, and drug resistance of human cells. The remarkable feature of this assay is its high capacity, which can test thousands of genome variations in a single experiment. This research will also improve our understanding of which parts of the genome are essential to life and which parts of the genome might be responsible for the proliferation of cancer cells.",Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements,9416160,R00HG008171,"['Advisory Committees', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'CRISPR library', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Code', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intercistronic Region', 'Introns', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA library', 'Reagent', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'cancer cell', 'cancer drug resistance', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'deletion library', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic element', 'genome analysis', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knock-down', 'laboratory experience', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'repaired', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small hairpin RNA', 'targeted nucleases', 'technology development', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R00,2018,242325,-0.011678351307064455
"Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetic code not only determines protein amino acid residue sequence but also defines the 'splicing code' of cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements that control pre-mRNA splicing. Single nucleotide variant (SNV) changes at key regions in pre-mRNA may disrupt splicing resulting in disease [1, 2]. Understanding which SNVs cause aberrant splicing and which are benign is important for understanding disease pathogenesis. SNVs at consensus splice sites, at exon-intron junctions, are known to cause aberrant splicing and contribute to at least 10% of inherited diseases [2]. However, SNVs outside consensus splice sites can still disrupt splicing [3]. Current, bioinformatics tools limit analysis to SNVs at or near consensus splice sites and lack the ability to generalize to SNVs beyond the consensus splice site [4-7]. In this application, I propose to substantially improve the ability to interpret the consequences of mutations on pre-mRNA splicing. This goal will be achieved by: 1) developing novel features, useful in predicting the impact of variation on cis- splicing regulation; 2) training a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses the novel features to predict the impact of SNVs; 3) sharing the algorithm in a publically available software package; and 4) comparing algorithm predictions to the relationships between SNVs and splicing patterns derived from matched DNA- and RNA-sequencing studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic sequences not only encode the amino acids of proteins but also regulate many critical biological functions, including pre-mRNA splicing. The impact of genetic variation on splicing is not well understood. The goal of this research project i to computationally identify features of variants useful in predicting aberrant splicing, then incorporate the features into a machine learning algorithm and test the utility of the predictions using publically available sequencing studies. 1            ",Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing,9213314,F31HG007804,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Inherited', 'Introns', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2017,17892,-0.018086810301554703
"Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome. Many viruses have been shown to be associated with human diseases. However, our understanding of the roles of viruses in ecological communities is very limited. Recent technological and computational advances make it possible to have a deep understanding of the roles of viruses in public health and the environment. Metagenomics studies from various environments including the human microbiome projects (HMP), global ocean, and the earth microbiome projects have generated large amounts of short read data. Viruses are present in most of these metagenomic data sets and their hosts are unknown. In this proposal, the investigators will develop computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomic data sets and for the study of virus-host interactions. For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators. Finally, the remaining reads will be assigned to the corresponding bins. For the study of virus- host interactions, computational methods to estimate the reliability of virus-host interactions from high-throughput experiments will first be developed. Then machine learning approaches will be developed to predict viruses infecting certain hosts. Finally, a network logistic regression approach will be developed to predict virus-host interactions. These computational approaches for the identification of viral sequences and for predicting virus-host interactions will be applied to a public liver cirrhosis and a unique metagenomics data set to understand how metagenomes change with health status, identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with disease status and accurately predict disease status using bacteria, viruses and virus-host interactions. The developed computational methods will also be used to analyze metageomic data from various locations based on the TARA ocean data and a unique time series data to understand how environmental factors affect virus abundance and virus-host interactions. Some of the predictions will be experimentally validated. Software derived from the proposal will be developed and freely distributed to the scientific community. Project Narrative Viruses are abundant in many environments and are important to public health. New statistical and computational tools will be developed for the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples and for the prediction of virus-host interactions. These tools will be used to analyze microbial data sets related to liver cirrhosis and travelers’ diarrhea as well as marine metagenomics data sets from various geographic locations and time series.",Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications,9312083,R01GM120624,"['Affect', 'Bacteria', 'Biological', 'Body Water', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environment and Public Health', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Geographic Locations', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Human', 'Human Microbiome', 'Human body', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Location', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Marines', 'Measures', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Network-based', 'Oceans', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Policies', 'Public Health', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Series', 'Soil', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traveler&apos', 's diarrhea', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'computer studies', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'interest', 'metagenome', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'particle', 'statistics', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,395858,0.021493899381417266
"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9353854,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Models', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2017,438098,-0.008453464806944661
"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,9203633,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Integration', 'DNA Structure', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gaussian model', 'Gene Components', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive tools', 'public health relevance', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,309913,-0.022066467772936468
"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9320692,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2017,552994,0.08019005674039666

"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9233159,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Intuition', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Toxicology', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool', 'web-based tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2017,329119,-0.009084831696800851
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9398667,R01GM123314,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alpha Cell', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animal Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Location', 'MALAT1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Running', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive tools', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2017,326862,0.005703529489897519
"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development.

"Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal since the completion of the Human Genome Project has been to understand all functional elements in the human genome and the role they play in normal biological processes and disease. To that end, large pooled libraries of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents have been developed for genome-wide loss-of-function screens but have been hindered by 3 problems: 1) the incompleteness of protein depletion inherent in partial knock-down; 2) off-target effects from the seed sequence; and 3) genetic elements that are not transcribed are inaccessible to manipulation. Genome engineering using precisely targeted nucleases has emerged as an innovative technology to modify the genome and causally interrogate the role of different functional elements. Recently, I developed a new technology for functional genomic screening using the RNA- guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease (Shalem*, Sanjana*, et al., Science, 2014). Since CRISPR works on the DNA level, it is possible to manipulate non-coding elements that are inaccessible to RNAi. The research goal of this proposal is to develop new biological tools and analysis techniques for functional annotation of non-coding elements using pooled CRISPR screens.  Mentored phase: First, I plan to develop and optimize high-throughput CRISPR non-coding mutagenesis libraries targeting introns, UTRs, promoters, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions to enable screening at high-resolution with megabase-scale coverage. Next, I will validate functional non-coding elements and use this large dataset to find unifying principles of how non-coding elements regulate gene expression. Independent phase: I plan to develop a novel CRISPR architecture for tiled deletion screens capable of deleting many segments over entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. With this technology and the increased screening throughput it enables, I will be able to develop a long-term independent research program in several possible directions, including further genome biology, personalized functional genomics, and predictive diagnostics for drug-genome interactions.  The two primary areas of training needed to help me succeed in my research goals are 1) CRISPR technology development (mentor: Dr. Feng Zhang) and 2) knowledge of human genetics and non-coding variation (mentor: Dr. David Altshuler). Each mentor is an established expert in these fields. My career development plan integrates additional laboratory training, specialized tutorials in human genetics from world experts, local and national presentations of my research, and courses in scientific writing, grantsmanship and job search strategies. To assist with science- and career-related decisions, I have assembled an Advisory Committee with a team of established, senior genomics experts: Drs. Eric Lander, Steven Hyman, and David Root. The Broad Institute is an ideal environment: All Mentors and Advisors are located in one building and there are facilities for high-throughput functional screening in th RNAi Platform (Director: Dr. Root). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to transform our understanding of the human genome by developing a new kind of functional assay capable of directly editing the genome and analyzing how this genome editing impacts the growth, development, and drug resistance of human cells. The remarkable feature of this assay is its high capacity, which can test thousands of genome variations in a single experiment. This research will also improve our understanding of which parts of the genome are essential to life and which parts of the genome might be responsible for the proliferation of cancer cells.",Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements,9258454,R00HG008171,"['Advisory Committees', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'CRISPR library', 'CRISPR screen', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Chromosomes', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development Plans', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genome engineering', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Guide RNA', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intercistronic Region', 'Introns', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutagenesis', 'Mutation', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Nature', 'Occupations', 'Paper', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plant Roots', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Proteins', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA library', 'Reagent', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Science', 'Seeds', 'Stem cells', 'Subfamily lentivirinae', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'cancer cell', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically relevant', 'deletion library', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'functional genomics', 'genetic element', 'genome analysis', 'genome editing', 'genome-wide', 'genomic predictors', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'knock-down', 'laboratory experience', 'loss of function', 'loss of function mutation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'nuclease', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'promoter', 'public health relevance', 'repaired', 'scaffold', 'screening', 'small hairpin RNA', 'technology development', 'tool', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R00,2017,244439,-0.011678351307064455
"Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetic code not only determines protein amino acid residue sequence but also defines the 'splicing code' of cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements that control pre-mRNA splicing. Single nucleotide variant (SNV) changes at key regions in pre-mRNA may disrupt splicing resulting in disease [1, 2]. Understanding which SNVs cause aberrant splicing and which are benign is important for understanding disease pathogenesis. SNVs at consensus splice sites, at exon-intron junctions, are known to cause aberrant splicing and contribute to at least 10% of inherited diseases [2]. However, SNVs outside consensus splice sites can still disrupt splicing [3]. Current, bioinformatics tools limit analysis to SNVs at or near consensus splice sites and lack the ability to generalize to SNVs beyond the consensus splice site [4-7]. In this application, I propose to substantially improve the ability to interpret the consequences of mutations on pre-mRNA splicing. This goal will be achieved by: 1) developing novel features, useful in predicting the impact of variation on cis- splicing regulation; 2) training a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses the novel features to predict the impact of SNVs; 3) sharing the algorithm in a publically available software package; and 4) comparing algorithm predictions to the relationships between SNVs and splicing patterns derived from matched DNA- and RNA-sequencing studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic sequences not only encode the amino acids of proteins but also regulate many critical biological functions, including pre-mRNA splicing. The impact of genetic variation on splicing is not well understood. The goal of this research project i to computationally identify features of variants useful in predicting aberrant splicing, then incorporate the features into a machine learning algorithm and test the utility of the predictions using publically available sequencing studies. 1            ",Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing,8991662,F31HG007804,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Inherited', 'Introns', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,43576,-0.018086810301554703
"DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Progress in DNA sequencing has occurred through multiple stages of disruptive new technologies being introduced to the field, each of which has increased sequencing capabilities by lowering costs, improving throughput, and reducing errors. The goal of this research project is to investigate a new, all-electronic sequencing method that has the potential to become the next transformative step for DNA sequencing. This new method is based on single DNA polymerase molecules bound to nanoscale electronic transistors, a hybrid device that transduces the activity of a single polymerase molecule into an electronic signal.  The goal of this research project is to determine whether these hybrid polymerase-transistors are truly applicable to DNA sequencing and the competitive environment of advanced sequencing technologies. To answer this question, the project teams the scientists who have developed the devices with Illumina, Inc., a worldwide leader in the DNA sequencing market. The experiments proposed here build on encouraging preliminary results, first to demonstrate accurate DNA sequencing and second to evaluate whether the new technique could become a competitive challenge to other sequencing methods. The interdisciplinary team will combine state-of-the-art techniques from protein engineering, nanoscale fabrication, and machine learning to customize polymerase's activity and its interactions with the electronic transistors. If successful, nanoscale solid-state devices like transistors provide one of the best opportunities for increasing sequencing capabilities while decreasing sequencing costs, so that DNA sequencing can become a standard technique in health care and disease treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Over the past two decades, DNA sequencing has transformed from a heroic, nearly impossible task to a routine component of modern laboratory research. The field of DNA sequencing has improved tremendously through a strategy of modifying and monitoring polymerases, a key enzyme at the heart of many DNA sequencing technologies. This proposal is motivated by developments in the field of single-molecule electronics, which provide an entirely new mode for listening to the activity of single polymerase molecules. This electronic method is very different from the biochemical, optical, or nanopore-based techniques currently in use, and it has inherent advantages that could provide exciting possibilities for DNA sequencing. The project will tailor single-molecule electronics for the specific purpose of DNA sequencing and determine whether this strategy could lead to a new generation of sequencing technology.",DNA Sequencing Using Single Molecule Electronics,9172062,R01HG009188,"['Affect', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Carbon', 'Charge', 'Collaborations', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Electronics', 'Enzyme Kinetics', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Hybrids', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Research', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Marketing', 'Massive Parallel Sequencing', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modification', 'Molecular Models', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nanotechnology', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Optics', 'Performance', 'Polymerase', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'collaborative environment', 'cost', 'enzyme activity', 'improved', 'molecular modeling', 'nanoelectronics', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'new technology', 'novel', 'research study', 'response', 'scale up', 'single molecule', 'single walled carbon nanotube', 'solid state']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2016,584552,-0.008453464806944661
"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules. We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique. Our first objective is to develop a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates secondary structure using double-stranded or single-stranded RNA sequencing. We will also develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features from RNA-seq experiments.

"Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural analysis of large polysaccharides remains challenging in glycobiology. The problem is especially acute when polysaccharides in question are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are large, linear, sulfated polysaccharides ubiquitous to all mammals. Interests in GAG structures stem from GAGs' diverse biological activities that govern phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration, inflammation, blood coagulation and amyloid plaque formation. Abnormal GAG structures have also been associated with the development of a number of diseases, notably cancer and inflammation. As a result, there has been a desire to understand how GAG structures correlate with their biological activities, especially how the distribution of sulfate groups along the chain influence their interactions with GAG-binding proteins. However, GAGs' large size and complex sulfation patterns make analysis of intact GAG chains by conventional ensemble analytical techniques difficult, if not impossible. Here we propose to develop a single molecule sequencer for analysis of polysaccharides using the recognition tunneling nanopore (RTP) device currently under development for ""$1000 genome"" project as a template. With the R21 grant, we will demonstrate the feasibility by carrying out pre-requisite work needed to achieve single molecule sequencing of intact GAG chains using RTP. A RTP device incorporates a nanopore with a tunneling nanogap that contains two electrodes functionalized with recognition molecules capable of forming transient complexes with functional groups on a polymeric chain as it translocates the nanopore, thus generating electrical signals. Single molecule sequencing of GAG chains proposed here circumvents the need to obtain homogeneous samples of GAGs, greatly reducing complexity of sample preparation. GAG analysis by RT devices also does not have the size limitations of most of the existing analytical techniques, and the solid state device planned here are economical to manufacturer and operate. In this application, we aim to carry out pilot studies needed to make GAG sequencing by RTPs feasible: (1) we will investigate the translocation of size defined sulfated GAG fragments through nanopores to optimize the translocation efficiency of GAG ligands as well as to understand the influence of GAG sulfation density and GAG size on their translocation efficiency and speed; (2) we will carry out recognition tunneling experiments on sulfated GAG disaccharides as well as trisaccharides so these signals of GAGs can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify unique signatures needed to detect the presence of these sulfation motifs in longer GAG chains. Completion of these aims will provide all the knowledge required for correct interpretations of RT signals produced by GAG translocation and sets the stage for sequencing of intact GAG chains by RT devices. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Work proposed here will allow single molecule sequencing of glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides using an electronic chip with a high speed and low cost for the first time. Glycosaminoglycans have important pharmacological properties and are modulators of critical biological phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration and inflammation.

"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8998963,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome browser', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive tools', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,306949,-0.022066467772936468
"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.        ","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9070289,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'human disease', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2016,377807,0.08019005674039666
"Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Abstract: Metal ions play vital roles in both the mechanism and architecture of biological macromolecules, including the catalysis of biochemical reactions, electron transport, binding of gases, and stabilization of nucleotides and other polyphosphate compounds. However, a recent survey of publicly available structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids deposited in the PDB revealed an abundance of misidentified and/or sub-optimally modeled metal binding sites. This prompted the creation of a diagnostic tool for the models of metal binding microenvironments, the ""CheckMyMetal"" (CMM) web server (http://csgid.org/csgid/metal_sites/), which detects geometric and other irregularities in structures of metal binding sites and alerts researchers to potential errors in metal assignment. As the production version of CMM has gained widespread usage, the research community has identified several directions for future development of major interest:1) investigate and validate uncommon heavy metal binding sites in macromolecular structures; 2) establish a server to provide customized subsets of high-quality, validated metal binding sites; 3) develop tools to automatically detect likely metal binding sites in electron density, and identify and add the most probable metal ion during crystallographic model building and refinement; and 4) systematically catalog metal binding architectures and detect new metal binding motifs. The toolkit we propose to develop, using CMM as a basis, contains several modules that will work either independently or as integrated steps in the structure modeling, validation, interpretation and annotation pipeline. This proposal was designed not only for structural biologists to model and validate new structures during crystallographic model building and refinement, but also for a broader audience—biomedical researchers studying metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids. Project: Metal binding environments in macromolecular structures Project Narrative: Metal ions such as iron, magnesium and zinc are crucial to life—many proteins and DNA/RNA macromolecules require these elements for numerous essential chemical and biophysical processes. Properly identifying and modeling metal ions are macromolecular atomic structures is not trivial, yet the scientific tools that support reliable analysis of metal ion binding sites are few, limited, and immature. Based on an established server used to check the quality of metal ion binding environment in macromolecules, we propose to develop a toolkit that will benefit many areas of research on structures of metal-containing proteins and nucleic acids, including validation, modeling, classification, and motif detection.",Metal binding sites in macromolecular structures,9008644,R01GM117325,"['Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical Reaction', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biophysical Process', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Custom', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Electron Transport', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Gases', 'Guidelines', 'Heavy Metals', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Ions', 'Iron', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnesium', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Metal Binding Site', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Structure', 'Names', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Nucleotides', 'Online Systems', 'Play', 'Polyphosphates', 'Procedures', 'Production', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structural Biologist', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'To specify', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Zinc', 'abstracting', 'base', 'comparative', 'computerized tools', 'database structure', 'density', 'design', 'drug discovery', 'electron density', 'experience', 'infancy', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'protein folding', 'protein structure prediction', 'support tools', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2016,343124,-0.009084831696800851
"CSHL Computational and Comparative Genomics Course DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory proposes to continue a course entitled ""Computational and Comparative Genomics"", to be held in the fall of 2014 - 2016.

"An Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central dogma of molecular biology has undergone a significant revision where RNAs have emerged as important regulators of cell activity. Astonishingly, as much as 80% of human DNA is transcribed into RNA as recently reported by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium. New classes of RNA are being identified including many which are non-protein coding (ncRNA). Nonetheless ncRNAs are involved in regulating cellular activity. Deciphering the structure-function relationship of these RNAs is of immediate importance as ncRNAs have now been implicated in a variety of diseases including myotonic dystrophy type 1, prostate cancer, spinal muscular atrophy, and Huntington's disease-like 2. Traditional approaches to determine high-resolution RNA 3D structures have proven to be prohibitively time consuming and expensive. Nymirum has developed an Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System that is faster, cheaper, and more robust than current approaches. This System will be commercialized for use by the drug industry and academic researchers in their quest to understand and treat human disease.

"Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal since the completion of the Human Genome Project has been to understand all functional elements in the human genome and the role they play in normal biological processes and disease. To that end, large pooled libraries of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents have been developed for genome-wide loss-of-function screens but have been hindered by 3 problems: 1) the incompleteness of protein depletion inherent in partial knock-down; 2) off-target effects from the seed sequence; and 3) genetic elements that are not transcribed are inaccessible to manipulation. Genome engineering using precisely targeted nucleases has emerged as an innovative technology to modify the genome and causally interrogate the role of different functional elements. Recently, I developed a new technology for functional genomic screening using the RNA- guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease (Shalem*, Sanjana*, et al., Science, 2014). Since CRISPR works on the DNA level, it is possible to manipulate non-coding elements that are inaccessible to RNAi. The research goal of this proposal is to develop new biological tools and analysis techniques for functional annotation of non-coding elements using pooled CRISPR screens.  Mentored phase: First, I plan to develop and optimize high-throughput CRISPR non-coding mutagenesis libraries targeting introns, UTRs, promoters, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions to enable screening at high-resolution with megabase-scale coverage. Next, I will validate functional non-coding elements and use this large dataset to find unifying principles of how non-coding elements regulate gene expression. Independent phase: I plan to develop a novel CRISPR architecture for tiled deletion screens capable of deleting many segments over entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. With this technology and the increased screening throughput it enables, I will be able to develop a long-term independent research program in several possible directions, including further genome biology, personalized functional genomics, and predictive diagnostics for drug-genome interactions.  The two primary areas of training needed to help me succeed in my research goals are 1) CRISPR technology development (mentor: Dr. Feng Zhang) and 2) knowledge of human genetics and non-coding variation (mentor: Dr. David Altshuler). Each mentor is an established expert in these fields. My career development plan integrates additional laboratory training, specialized tutorials in human genetics from world experts, local and national presentations of my research, and courses in scientific writing, grantsmanship and job search strategies. To assist with science- and career-related decisions, I have assembled an Advisory Committee with a team of established, senior genomics experts: Drs. Eric Lander, Steven Hyman, and David Root. The Broad Institute is an ideal environment: All Mentors and Advisors are located in one building and there are facilities for high-throughput functional screening in th RNAi Platform (Director: Dr. Root).

"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain. Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons. This will be a crucial first step in elucidating the RNA networks regulated by these RBPs in the brain.",Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain,8997123,R01NS075449,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Angelman Syndrome', 'Antibodies', 'Antisense Oligonucleotides', 'Behavioral', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Double-Stranded RNA', 'ES Cell Line', 'Elements', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'Expression Library', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Future', 'Genomic approach', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indium', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger, Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'crosslink', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'lentiviral-mediated', 'messenger ribonucleoprotein', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein complex', 'relating to nervous system', 'ribosome profiling', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2016,599873,0.07605195393823569
"Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetic code not only determines protein amino acid residue sequence but also defines the 'splicing code' of cis- and trans-acting regulatory elements that control pre-mRNA splicing. Single nucleotide variant (SNV) changes at key regions in pre-mRNA may disrupt splicing resulting in disease [1, 2]. Understanding which SNVs cause aberrant splicing and which are benign is important for understanding disease pathogenesis. SNVs at consensus splice sites, at exon-intron junctions, are known to cause aberrant splicing and contribute to at least 10% of inherited diseases [2]. However, SNVs outside consensus splice sites can still disrupt splicing [3]. Current, bioinformatics tools limit analysis to SNVs at or near consensus splice sites and lack the ability to generalize to SNVs beyond the consensus splice site [4-7]. In this application, I propose to substantially improve the ability to interpret the consequences of mutations on pre-mRNA splicing. This goal will be achieved by: 1) developing novel features, useful in predicting the impact of variation on cis- splicing regulation; 2) training a supervised machine learning algorithm that uses the novel features to predict the impact of SNVs; 3) sharing the algorithm in a publically available software package; and 4) comparing algorithm predictions to the relationships between SNVs and splicing patterns derived from matched DNA- and RNA-sequencing studies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Genetic sequences not only encode the amino acids of proteins but also regulate many critical biological functions, including pre-mRNA splicing. The impact of genetic variation on splicing is not well understood. The goal of this research project i to computationally identify features of variants useful in predicting aberrant splicing, then incorporate the features into a machine learning algorithm and test the utility of the predictions using publically available sequencing studies. 1            ",Predicting Impact of Genetic Variation on Splicing,8833507,F31HG007804,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Benign', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Cell physiology', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Comparative Study', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Code', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Inherited', 'Introns', 'Label', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research Project Grants', 'Role', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'improved', 'interest', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,43120,-0.018086810301554703
"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK. The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data.

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules. We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique. Our first objective is to develop a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates secondary structure using double-stranded or single-stranded RNA sequencing. We will also develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features from RNA-seq experiments.

"Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Structural analysis of large polysaccharides remains challenging in glycobiology. The problem is especially acute when polysaccharides in question are glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are large, linear, sulfated polysaccharides ubiquitous to all mammals. Interests in GAG structures stem from GAGs' diverse biological activities that govern phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration, inflammation, blood coagulation and amyloid plaque formation. Abnormal GAG structures have also been associated with the development of a number of diseases, notably cancer and inflammation. As a result, there has been a desire to understand how GAG structures correlate with their biological activities, especially how the distribution of sulfate groups along the chain influence their interactions with GAG-binding proteins. However, GAGs' large size and complex sulfation patterns make analysis of intact GAG chains by conventional ensemble analytical techniques difficult, if not impossible. Here we propose to develop a single molecule sequencer for analysis of polysaccharides using the recognition tunneling nanopore (RTP) device currently under development for ""$1000 genome"" project as a template. With the R21 grant, we will demonstrate the feasibility by carrying out pre-requisite work needed to achieve single molecule sequencing of intact GAG chains using RTP. A RTP device incorporates a nanopore with a tunneling nanogap that contains two electrodes functionalized with recognition molecules capable of forming transient complexes with functional groups on a polymeric chain as it translocates the nanopore, thus generating electrical signals. Single molecule sequencing of GAG chains proposed here circumvents the need to obtain homogeneous samples of GAGs, greatly reducing complexity of sample preparation. GAG analysis by RT devices also does not have the size limitations of most of the existing analytical techniques, and the solid state device planned here are economical to manufacturer and operate. In this application, we aim to carry out pilot studies needed to make GAG sequencing by RTPs feasible: (1) we will investigate the translocation of size defined sulfated GAG fragments through nanopores to optimize the translocation efficiency of GAG ligands as well as to understand the influence of GAG sulfation density and GAG size on their translocation efficiency and speed; (2) we will carry out recognition tunneling experiments on sulfated GAG disaccharides as well as trisaccharides so these signals of GAGs can be analyzed using machine learning algorithms to identify unique signatures needed to detect the presence of these sulfation motifs in longer GAG chains. Completion of these aims will provide all the knowledge required for correct interpretations of RT signals produced by GAG translocation and sets the stage for sequencing of intact GAG chains by RT devices.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Work proposed here will allow single molecule sequencing of glycosaminoglycan polysaccharides using an electronic chip with a high speed and low cost for the first time. Glycosaminoglycans have important pharmacological properties and are modulators of critical biological phenomena such as tissue development/regeneration and inflammation. Determination of their sequence structures will allow better understanding of how organisms control these physiological events through glycosaminoglycans.            ",Single Molecule Sequencing of Glycosaminoglycans using Recognition Tunneling Nanopores,8984813,R21GM118339,"['Acute', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Architecture', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Phenomena', 'Blood coagulation', 'Cells', 'Charge', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disaccharides', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electronics', 'Electrons', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Genome', 'Glycobiology', 'Glycosaminoglycans', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Imidazole', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inorganic Sulfates', 'Ions', 'Isomerism', 'Knowledge', 'Leukocyte Trafficking', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Mammals', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Natural regeneration', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Oligosaccharides', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polysaccharides', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Senile Plaques', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Protein', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trisaccharides', 'Unspecified or Sulfate Ion Sulfates', 'Work', 'amyloid formation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'functional group', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'polysulfated glycosaminoglycan', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'stem', 'sugar', 'sulfation', 'tool']",NIGMS,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,R21,2015,273816,0.01194152933769385
"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks Project summary It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases. Public Health Relevance Statement RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases.

"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription facors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8795204,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Health', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2015,304719,-0.022066467772936468
"Epigenomic control of RNA splicing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central objective of this project is to elucidate the roles of epigenetics and chromatin states in RNA splicing regulation. Eukaryotic cells generate astonishing regulatory diversity and as a consequence exceedingly complex phenotypes from a finite set of genes. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays an essential role in creating this regulatory diversity by generating multiple RNA isoforms from a single gene. Traditionally, splicing was considered as a ""post-transcriptional"" process, and studies of splicing regulation have largely focused on the roles of cis splicing regulatory elements and their interactions with canonical RNA-binding splicing factors. However, recent studies of eukaryotic epigenomes and transcriptomes have revealed a surprisingly complex picture of splicing regulation shaped by chromatin states and epigenetic marks. Exons are characterized by increased levels of nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, and certain histone modifications. Many introns are spliced co-transcriptionally when the nascent RNAs are tethered to the chromatin, and changes in the transcription elongation rate or epigenetic marks can influence exon splicing patterns. Despite these exciting findings, many questions about epigenetic regulation of splicing remain unresolved. We propose to systematically investigate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing, by taking advantage of the broad and deep epigenome and transcriptome data generated by the Epigenome Roadmap project. By correlating transcriptome profiles to epigenome profiles across diverse cell types, we aim to address a series of important questions regarding epigenetic regulation of co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional RNA splicing. In three aims, we will investigate epigenome-splicing correlation in diverse tissues and cell types (Aim 1), identify combinatorial chromatin states and long-range interactions associated with splicing (Aim 2), and elucidate how epigenetic determinants affect chromatin-associated splicing (Aim 3). The proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of splicing regulation, and how epigenetic signals influence alternative splicing in normal and diseased cells. In addition, through the proposed work we will develop novel computational methods for linking epigenome signatures to RNA splicing patterns. We anticipate that these tools will be of broad interest and utility to researchers studying epigenome and transcriptome regulation in diverse biological systems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many human diseases are caused by aberrant pre-mRNA splicing. This project will use extensive epigenome and transcriptome profiles from the Epigenome Roadmap project to elucidate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing. These studies will provide significant insight into how splicing is regulated, and how epigenetic and environmental signals disrupt splicing in human diseases.",Epigenomic control of RNA splicing,8921202,R01ES024995,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Kinetics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Elongation', 'Work', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'epigenetic regulation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'information organization', 'insight', 'interest', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'scaffold', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2015,308000,-0.02346598112818262

"An Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central dogma of molecular biology has undergone a significant revision where RNAs have emerged as important regulators of cell activity. Astonishingly, as much as 80% of human DNA is transcribed into RNA as recently reported by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium. New classes of RNA are being identified including many which are non-protein coding (ncRNA). Nonetheless ncRNAs are involved in regulating cellular activity. Deciphering the structure-function relationship of these RNAs is of immediate importance as ncRNAs have now been implicated in a variety of diseases including myotonic dystrophy type 1, prostate cancer, spinal muscular atrophy, and Huntington's disease-like 2.

"Structure based prediction of the interactome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. All developed software will be made publicly available. Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management.

"Genome engineering tools for functional screening of non-coding elements     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A major goal since the completion of the Human Genome Project has been to understand all functional elements in the human genome and the role they play in normal biological processes and disease. To that end, large pooled libraries of RNA interference (RNAi) reagents have been developed for genome-wide loss-of-function screens but have been hindered by 3 problems: 1) the incompleteness of protein depletion inherent in partial knock-down; 2) off-target effects from the seed sequence; and 3) genetic elements that are not transcribed are inaccessible to manipulation. Genome engineering using precisely targeted nucleases has emerged as an innovative technology to modify the genome and causally interrogate the role of different functional elements. Recently, I developed a new technology for functional genomic screening using the RNA- guided CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease (Shalem*, Sanjana*, et al., Science, 2014). Since CRISPR works on the DNA level, it is possible to manipulate non-coding elements that are inaccessible to RNAi. The research goal of this proposal is to develop new biological tools and analysis techniques for functional annotation of non-coding elements using pooled CRISPR screens.  Mentored phase: First, I plan to develop and optimize high-throughput CRISPR non-coding mutagenesis libraries targeting introns, UTRs, promoters, non-coding RNAs, and intergenic regions to enable screening at high-resolution with megabase-scale coverage. Next, I will validate functional non-coding elements and use this large dataset to find unifying principles of how non-coding elements regulate gene expression. Independent phase: I plan to develop a novel CRISPR architecture for tiled deletion screens capable of deleting many segments over entire chromosomes or even entire genomes. With this technology and the increased screening throughput it enables, I will be able to develop a long-term independent research program in several possible directions, including further genome biology, personalized functional genomics, and predictive diagnostics for drug-genome interactions.  The two primary areas of training needed to help me succeed in my research goals are 1) CRISPR technology development (mentor: Dr. Feng Zhang) and 2) knowledge of human genetics and non-coding variation (mentor: Dr. David Altshuler). Each mentor is an established expert in these fields. My career development plan integrates additional laboratory training, specialized tutorials in human genetics from world experts, local and national presentations of my research, and courses in scientific writing, grantsmanship and job search strategies. To assist with science- and career-related decisions, I have assembled an Advisory Committee with a team of established, senior genomics experts: Drs. Eric Lander, Steven Hyman, and David Root. The Broad Institute is an ideal environment: All Mentors and Advisors are located in one building and there are facilities for high-throughput functional screening in th RNAi Platform (Director: Dr. Root).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project seeks to transform our understanding of the human genome by developing a new kind of functional assay capable of directly editing the genome and analyzing how this genome editing impacts the growth, development, and drug resistance of human cells. The remarkable feature of this assay is its high capacity, which can test thousands of genome variations in a single experiment.

This approach requires a high-resolution quaternary (3D) protein complex structure, whose experimental determination is often a slow process that is not always successful. Protein structure and binding interface prediction algorithms are poised to impact human health by accelerating the construction of high-confidence structural models of drug targets and biopharmaceuticals, which will help identify new therapeutic strategies. However, the current algorithms are very limited in their ability to predict high-resolution antibody-antige models, which is preventing the discovery of broad classes of therapeutics. In addition, technologies are needed to predict if a candidate antibody will fail as early as possible in the development process. With improvements in accuracy and usability, computational antibody structure and epitope prediction methods can be used to lower drug development costs and focus experiments on the most promising drug candidates.

We propose to create an automatic software pipeline that predicts the highest frequency of high-resolution antibody-antigen structures that are suitable for antibody screening and biopharmaceutical design projects.  Previously in Phase I, we successfully created the most accurate models for predicting epitopes by incorporating both protein sequence information and structural features derived from experimental and high- resolution predicted protein antigen structures. In this Phase II project, we will combine our fiel-leading epitope prediction models with improvements to NovaFold and NovaDock that will discover better, lower energy binding arrangements between an antibody and its antigen.

"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain. Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons. This will be a crucial first step in elucidating the RNA networks regulated by these RBPs in the brain.",Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain,8790775,R01NS075449,"['Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Angelman Syndrome', 'Antibodies', 'Antisense Oligonucleotides', 'Behavioral', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Defect', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Double-Stranded RNA', 'ES Cell Line', 'Elements', 'Epitopes', 'Event', 'Expression Library', 'Fragile X Syndrome', 'Future', 'Genomic approach', 'Germ Layers', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indium', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mental disorders', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phenotype', 'Pluripotent Stem Cells', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Stability', 'RNA, Messenger, Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Resources', 'Ribosomes', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Spinal', 'Spinal Muscular Atrophy', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Translations', 'Untranslated RNA', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'crosslink', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'human RBM5 protein', 'human embryonic stem cell', 'human embryonic stem cell line', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'lentiviral-mediated', 'messenger ribonucleoprotein', 'nerve stem cell', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'protein complex', 'relating to nervous system', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2015,599873,0.07605195393823569
"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the next-generation sequencing analysis tools, and thereby allowing biomedical researchers to take full advantage of next-generation sequencing to study biology and disease.            ",Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing,8683213,R01HG006870,"['Algorithms', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bruck-de Lange syndrome', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cholesterol', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Internet', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cohesin', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'xenopus development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2014,221252,0.0025026238989911344
"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.        The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data. With this grant we will improve these tools, make them more robust, and extend them to new sequencing technologies.

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules.           We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique. Our first objective is to develop a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates secondary structure using double-stranded or single-stranded RNA sequencing.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks  Project summary It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.  Public Health Relevance Statement RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases.

"Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape  Title: Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape PI: Rohs, Remo (USC); Co-I: Noble, William Stafford (UW); Co-I: Tullius, Thomas D. (BU) PROJECT SUMMARY Current techniques for genome analysis are mainly based on the one-dimensional DNA sequence, comprised of the letters A, C, G, and T. However, proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional (3D) object. Nuances in DNA shape at single nucleotide resolution play a crucial role in the binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs), including those involved in embryonic development and human cancer. This project involves the development of a battery of tools for genome analysis, through the integration of information derived from the DNA sequence and the 3D structure of DNA, or ""DNA shape"". The basis for these novel tools is a high- throughput (HT) method for the prediction of multiple features of local DNA shape at the genomic scale. Data will be made available to the community in the UCSC Genome Browser track format through a web server interface. These tools will enable users to analyze the shape of any number or length of DNA sequences, including whole genomes and the effect of DNA methylation. HT shape predictions will be validated based on X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy, and hydroxyl radical cleavage data. Predictions will be combined with ORChID, an ENCODE project that infers DNA minor groove geometry from hydroxyl radical cleavage experiments. The HT method will be used to study how paralogous TFs select different target sites in vivo despite sharing core-binding motifs or having similar binding properties in vitro. To study this question, we will investigate the effect of flanking sequences on multiple structural features of TF binding sites (TFBSs). The initial focus of this study will be homeodomains and basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) TFs. Other protein families will later be included and used to construct a comprehensive TFBS database that provides shape features for binding motifs derived from JASPAR and other motif databases. Structural effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) will also be analyzed. Some SNPs are associated with deleterious functions, whereas others have no apparent effect. The HT shape prediction method will be used to predict the function of SNPs in non-coding regions based on DNA shape. We will correlate quantitative effects of SNPs on DNA structure with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals, to develop a predictive tool for the functional effect of SNPs. The HT shape prediction approach will be used to design DNA sequences with different AT/GC contents but similar shapes. The relative contributions of sequence and shape to binding will be tested with analytic models including multiple linear regression (MLR) and support vector regression (SVR). For systems in which the integration of sequence and shape proves advantageous, novel motif finding tools will be developed based on an extended alphabet that combines sequence with informative structural features, selected by machine learning and feature selection approaches. Sequence+shape motifs will be tested by motif scanning, compared to sequence-only motifs, and integrated into the MEME Suite. The goal of this sequence-shape integration is to increase the accuracy of finding in vivo TFBSs in the genome. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Protein-DNA recognition is a critical yet poorly understood component of gene regulation. This proposal will connect the fields of DNA sequence and structure analysis, which so far have been developed in parallel but largely disconnected from each other. Integration of the one-dimensional DNA sequence at a genome-wide scale with the three-dimensional DNA structure at atomic resolution will lead to the development of novel genome analysis tools and will advance our understanding of genome function, leading to fundamentally new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation and its impact on human disease.            ",Genome analysis based on the integration of DNA sequence and shape,8632246,R01GM106056,"['Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'BHLH Protein', 'Base Pairing', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Process', 'ChIP-on-chip', 'ChIP-seq', 'Characteristics', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'DNA', 'DNA Binding', 'DNA Databases', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA Structure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'DNase-I Footprinting', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Embryonic Development', 'Family', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genome Scan', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Helix-Turn-Helix Motifs', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'In Vitro', 'Internet', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Linear Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Mining', 'Minor Groove', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Nucleotides', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Family', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Relative (related person)', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Width', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'design', 'flexibility', 'genetic evolution', 'genome analysis', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homeodomain', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'member', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'vector']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2014,334303,-0.022083603324778343
"Epigenomic control of RNA splicing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central objective of this project is to elucidate the roles of epigenetics and chromatin states in RNA splicing regulation. Eukaryotic cells generate astonishing regulatory diversity and as a consequence exceedingly complex phenotypes from a finite set of genes. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing plays an essential role in creating this regulatory diversity by generating multiple RNA isoforms from a single gene. Traditionally, splicing was considered as a ""post-transcriptional"" process, and studies of splicing regulation have largely focused on the roles of cis splicing regulatory elements and their interactions with canonical RNA-binding splicing factors. However, recent studies of eukaryotic epigenomes and transcriptomes have revealed a surprisingly complex picture of splicing regulation shaped by chromatin states and epigenetic marks. Exons are characterized by increased levels of nucleosome positioning, DNA methylation, and certain histone modifications. Many introns are spliced co-transcriptionally when the nascent RNAs are tethered to the chromatin, and changes in the transcription elongation rate or epigenetic marks can influence exon splicing patterns. Despite these exciting findings, many questions about epigenetic regulation of splicing remain unresolved. We propose to systematically investigate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing, by taking advantage of the broad and deep epigenome and transcriptome data generated by the Epigenome Roadmap project. By correlating transcriptome profiles to epigenome profiles across diverse cell types, we aim to address a series of important questions regarding epigenetic regulation of co-transcriptional and post-transcriptional RNA splicing. In three aims, we will investigate epigenome-splicing correlation in diverse tissues and cell types (Aim 1), identify combinatorial chromatin states and long-range interactions associated with splicing (Aim 2), and elucidate how epigenetic determinants affect chromatin-associated splicing (Aim 3). The proposed studies will significantly advance our understanding of splicing regulation, and how epigenetic signals influence alternative splicing in normal and diseased cells. In addition, through the proposed work we will develop novel computational methods for linking epigenome signatures to RNA splicing patterns. We anticipate that these tools will be of broad interest and utility to researchers studying epigenome and transcriptome regulation in diverse biological systems.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many human diseases are caused by aberrant pre-mRNA splicing. This project will use extensive epigenome and transcriptome profiles from the Epigenome Roadmap project to elucidate chromatin and epigenetic regulation of RNA splicing. These studies will provide significant insight into how splicing is regulated, and how epigenetic and environmental signals disrupt splicing in human diseases.            ",Epigenomic control of RNA splicing,8815662,R01ES024995,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryotic Cell', 'Event', 'Exons', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Kinetics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Nucleosomes', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surveys', 'Systems Biology', 'Tissues', 'Transcription Elongation', 'Work', 'biological systems', 'cell type', 'combinatorial', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'histone modification', 'human disease', 'information organization', 'insight', 'interest', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'scaffold', 'tool']",NIEHS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2014,308000,-0.02346598112818262

"An Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The central dogma of molecular biology has undergone a significant revision where RNAs have emerged as important regulators of cell activity. Astonishingly, as much as 80% of human DNA is transcribed into RNA as recently reported by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) consortium. New classes of RNA are being identified including many which are non-protein coding (ncRNA). Nonetheless ncRNAs are involved in regulating cellular activity. Deciphering the structure-function relationship of these RNAs is of immediate importance as ncRNAs have now been implicated in a variety of diseases including myotonic dystrophy type 1, prostate cancer, spinal muscular atrophy, and Huntington's disease-like 2. Traditional approaches to determine high-resolution RNA 3D structures have proven to be prohibitively time consuming and expensive. Nymirum has developed an Automated RNA 3D Structure Determination System that is faster, cheaper, and more robust than current approaches. This System will be commercialized for use by the drug industry and academic researchers in their quest to understand and treat human disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RNA 3D structure and function information is critical to understanding basic cell function, delineating dysfunctional RNA contribution to human disease, and finding new drugs to treat diseases caused by dysfunctional RNAs.

"Structure based prediction of the interactome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. All developed software will be made publicly available.          Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management. In this project, we develop computational methods for structure-based prediction of protein-protein and protein- RNA interactions, and integrate these predictions with available high-throughput genomic data to predict the Interactomes of entire species' genomes.

"Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies bind to specific regions of proteins called epitopes, which elicits cellular responses. Traditional antibody discovery processes require laborious and expensive screening experiments, so computational approaches that predict epitopes and accelerate antibody discovery are in high demand. Structure-based antibody design is also important to the modern drug discovery and development process. This approach requires a high-resolution quaternary (3D) protein complex structure, whose experimental determination is often a slow process that is not always successful. Protein structure and binding interface prediction algorithms are poised to impact human health by accelerating the construction of high-confidence structural models of drug targets and biopharmaceuticals, which will help identify new therapeutic strategies. However, the current algorithms are very limited in their ability to predict high-resolution antibody-antige models, which is preventing the discovery of broad classes of therapeutics. In addition, technologies are needed to predict if a candidate antibody will fail as early as possible in the development process. With improvements in accuracy and usability, computational antibody structure and epitope prediction methods can be used to lower drug development costs and focus experiments on the most promising drug candidates.  DNASTAR recently released NovaFold, a commercial version of the world leading I-TASSER protein folding algorithm (Yang Zhang, U. Michigan) running on a cloud computing platform. NovaDock, our prospective protein interaction modeling product based on the up-and-coming SwarmDock algorithm (Paul Bates, Cancer Research UK), will use the same cloud infrastructure. NovaFold is proving useful to the molecular biology community; however, it is not adapted to model protein complexes like antibodies. Also, NovaFold and NovaDock currently do not model the type of structural fluctuations that are critical for antibody recognition. These enhancements could dramatically improve the predictive accuracy of the programs. We propose to create an automatic software pipeline that predicts the highest frequency of high-resolution antibody-antigen structures that are suitable for antibody screening and biopharmaceutical design projects.  Previously in Phase I, we successfully created the most accurate models for predicting epitopes by incorporating both protein sequence information and structural features derived from experimental and high- resolution predicted protein antigen structures. In this Phase II project, we will combine our fiel-leading epitope prediction models with improvements to NovaFold and NovaDock that will discover better, lower energy binding arrangements between an antibody and its antigen. The improvements will more accurately model the structural plasticity of an antibody by broadening the conformational diversity of the prediction process. At the conclusion of this work, we will deliver a cloud-based software product of suitable accuracy to dramatically increase the rate of selecting antibodies that specifically recognize a desired therapeutic target.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The use of monoclonal antibodies targeted against specific antigens are a critical, rapidly growing component of enhancing human health globally. Current practices for identifying appropriate antibodies are expensive and time consuming. We propose to dramatically streamline the monoclonal antibody selection process by combining and enhancing some of the best-in-class software programs and approaches currently available to create a software pipeline to aid users' ability to determine epitopes and model their binding to specific antibodies. The resulting computer simulated models will support major advancements in drug discovery for human health, animal health and related research.            ",Structural bioinformatics software for epitope selection and antibody engineering,8781169,R44GM100520,"['Algorithms', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Binding Sites', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Lymphocyte Epitopes', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Products', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Epitope Mapping', 'Epitopes', 'Frequencies', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Marketing', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Nature', 'Peptide Sequence Determination', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Dynamics', 'Protein Region', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Seminal', 'Simulate', 'Site', 'Software Tools', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Surface Antigens', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Time', 'Work', 'Yang', 'antibody engineering', 'anticancer research', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'cloud based', 'cost', 'design', 'drug candidate', 'drug development', 'drug discovery', 'flexibility', 'glycosylation', 'graphical user interface', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'kinematics', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'protein complex', 'protein folding', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'response', 'restraint', 'screening', 'simulation', 'structural biology', 'therapeutic target', 'therapy development', 'three dimensional structure', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"DNASTAR, INC.",R44,2014,746428,-0.03428710030839721
"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain.          Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons. This will be a crucial first step in elucidating the RNA networks regulated by these RBPs in the brain.

"New Physical Methodologies for Genomic Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite substantial efforts in developing sequencing technologies and computational software, spanning over 30 years, the full genome of any but the simplest organisms is still unable to automatically reconstructed. The length of the DNA sequences that can be 'read' by modern sequencing systems is substantially smaller than the length of most genomes (1000s of base-pairs versus millions to billions), making it virtually impossible to use the fragmented information generated by the shotgun sequencing process to reconstruct the long-range information linking together genomic segments belonging to a same chromosome. The main reason why genome assembly is difficult is genomic repeats - segments of DNA that occur in multiple identical or near-identical copies throughout a genome. Any repeats longer than the length of a sequencing read introduce ambiguity in the possible reconstructions of a genome - an exponential (in the number of repeats) number of different genomes can be constructed from the same set of reads, among which only one is the true reconstruction of the genome being assembled. Finding this one correct genome from among the many possible alternatives is impossible without the use of additional information, such as mate-pair information constraining the relative placement of pairs of shotgun reads along the genome. Mate-pair information is routinely generated in sequencing experiments and has been critical to scientists' ability to reconstruct genomes from shotgun data (e.g., mate-pair information was crucial to the success of the first prokaryotic genome project - Haemophilus influenza). Given these outstanding issues, a series of interlocking aims is proposed that center on enhanced optical and electronic detection of specially-decorated, genomic DNA molecules. The aims are designed for enabling new technologies that will provide sufficient physical map information to intimately mix with modern sequencing data for comprehensive assembly of complex genomes. These proposed advancements will be cradled within a new generation of nanofluidic devices engendering novel means for molecular control and detection. Such efforts will be directed by state-of-the art computer simulations that will model novel aspects of the new platforms for allowing rapid loops of design/implementation/testing. The main thrust of these technological developments will be carefully guided and serve a broad-based bioinformatics framework that will be developed for this work while laying the basis for highly integrated approaches to genome assembly and analysis.          Development of new machines and software is proposed, which will rapidly analyze a person's genome and reveal new types of information that doctors will be able to use for treating patients. The machines that will be developed are actually very small devices that may one day be sufficiently miniaturized to fit in a person's hand.

"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms. Next-generation sequencing, which enables rapid generation of billions of bases at relatively low cost, poses a significant computational challenge on how to analyze the large amount of sequence data efficiently and accurately. The goal of this research is to develop open-source software to improve both the efficiency and accuracy of the next-generation sequencing analysis tools, and thereby allowing biomedical researchers to take full advantage of next-generation sequencing to study biology and disease.            ",Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing,8518436,R01HG006870,"['Algorithms', 'Anus', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bruck-de Lange syndrome', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cholesterol', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA-Protein Interaction', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Exons', 'Facioscapulohumeral', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Growth and Development function', 'Internet', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Muscular Dystrophies', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Software Engineering', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Uncertainty', 'Work', 'base', 'cohesin', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'epigenome', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'functional genomics', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'public health relevance', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'xenopus development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2013,220626,0.0025026238989911344
"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina. Life Sciences 454, and ABI SOLID, from hybrid capture of exomes to 1000s of low-pass samples in the 1000 Genomes Project. Our emphasis on technology-agnostic processing tools has helped to popularize the now standard SAM/BAM and VCFs formats for representing NGS data and variation calls, respectively. In this RFA we propose to  continue to develop the GATK-Engine and data processing tools to (1) achieve complete and accurate  variation discovery and genotyping for all major sequencing study designs and NGS technologies (2)  optimize the GATK-Engine and pipelining infrastructure to operate efficiently on distributed data sets at the  scale of tens of thousands of samples (3) extend the GATK data processing tools to support the upcoming  sequencing technologies of Complete Genomics, lon Torrent, and Pacific Biosciences as well as we do  current technologies, (4) expand significantly our educational and support structures to ensure that the longtail  of future NGS users can benefit from the best-practice data processing and analysis tools in the GATK.        The proposed project aims to continue to develop the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a suite of widely used and mission-critical tools for analyzing the next-generation DNA sequencing data. With this grant we will improve these tools, make them more robust, and extend them to new sequencing technologies. This is essential to realize the potential of DNA sequencing to understand human history, diversity, and to discover  new loci associated with human disease, leading to new biologic hypotheses and new drug targets.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.            Project Narrative The explosion in data related to molecular biology has created great opportunities for new disease diagnostics and therapies. One source of data is the three-dimensional (3D) structure of biological molecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA. This work focuses on using computational technologies to understand how these structures perform their function, so we have a better understanding of both normal and disease processes.",Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures,8528717,R01LM005652,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Calcium Binding', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Crystallography', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Binding Site', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Explosion', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Grant', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Informatics', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Korea', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Medicine', 'Molecular Structure', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Pathologic', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphorylation Site', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Retrieval', 'San Francisco', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Software Engineering', 'Source', 'Source Code', 'Specialist', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'United States National Library of Medicine', 'Universities', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'advanced simulation', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cost', 'data reduction', 'design', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'structural genomics', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,292222,0.003359068976521687
"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms. In total, our findings will yield tremendous insights into non-coding RNA biology and will substantially impact continued study of these important molecules.           We propose to develop computational methods to study novel non-coding RNA transcripts by leveraging a new duplex RNA sequencing technique. Our first objective is to develop a maximum likelihood algorithm that estimates secondary structure using double-stranded or single-stranded RNA sequencing. We will also develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features from RNA-seq experiments. These methods will be used to annotate all RNA transcripts using experimental data from human and five model organisms.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks  Project summary It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.  Public Health Relevance Statement RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases. The proposed study is to investigate the fundamentals of neuronal RNA complexity at the systems level, using a combination of high-throughput experimental technologies and novel integrative computational methods.",An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks,8582163,R00GM095713,"['Age', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Exons', 'Foxes', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knock-out', 'Knockout Mice', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Mus', 'Muscle', 'Neurons', 'Nucleotides', 'Organism', 'Phase', 'Polyadenylation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Side', 'Site', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'combinatorial', 'comparative', 'computer based statistical methods', 'computer studies', 'design', 'functional outcomes', 'genome-wide', 'high throughput technology', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'mRNA Export', 'mRNA Stability', 'markov model', 'new technology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'research study', 'skills', 'structural genomics', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R00,2013,249000,0.020121184795335974
"Functional RNA elements in the human genome DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-mRNA splicing is essential for proper gene expression in higher eukaryotic genomes, as the vast majority of genes contain introns that have to be accurately recognized and removed. Recent studies have revealed that >90% of the genes undergo alternative splicing, which is believed to contribute to the complexity of the proteome in different cell types and tissues in vertebrates and abundant evidence suggests that altered splicing causes a variety of human diseases. Despite extensive knowledge on the splicing mechanism based on biochemical dissection of model minigenes, we know little about how many genes are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and where the functional RNA elements are embedded in the human genome. Built on our productive research in the current award period, we now propose a bold plan to systematically attack the critical gap of our knowledge about the regulation of alternative splicing. We will pursue three major lines of research by utilizing the latest and innovative genomics technologies. (1) We will use a new, automated platform recently developed in our lab to profile hundreds of conserved alternative splicing events against every annotated genes in the human genome. This unbiased approach will generate unprecedented information to uncover novel splicing regulators and deduce pathways in regulated splicing. (2) We will focus on RNA binding proteins involved in individual regulatory pathways to elucidate the molecular basis for regulated splicing by mapping their physical interactions with expressed RNA. For this purpose, we will construct a large panel of cell lines based on FLP-In 293 cells to express individual RNA binding proteins as a V5-tagged protein at the C- terminus, which will permit large-scale mapping of RNA-protein interactions by CLIP-seq (CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing) under a similar and optimized set of conditions. (3) Our third goal is to use the information generated from the proposed mapping and functional studies to develop an integrated framework for de novo prediction of splicing regulation by using machine-learning and graphical models. This research has the potential to fundamentally change our view on splicing control and its contribution to human disease. This RNA genomics project aims to deduce the splicing code in the human genome by systematic determination of genes involved in regulated splicing, elucidation of regulatory pathways, and RNA-protein interactions. The proposed research will use the latest genomics technologies to reveal functional RNA elements in the human genome, which will provide the molecular basis for many RNA-related human diseases.",Functional RNA elements in the human genome,8471148,R01HG004659,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Award', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cistrons', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exons', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'crosslink', 'empowered', 'functional group', 'functional outcomes', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homologous recombination', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mRNA Precursor', 'mammalian genome', 'new technology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2013,649400,0.0038945576821617527
"Structure based prediction of the interactome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. All developed software will be made publicly available.          Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management. In this project, we develop computational methods for structure-based prediction of protein-protein and protein- RNA interactions, and integrate these predictions with available high-throughput genomic data to predict the Interactomes of entire species' genomes.

"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain.          Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders. This proposal seeks to establish the interactions among selected RBPs and their functional RNA elements in mammalian neurons. This will be a crucial first step in elucidating the RNA networks regulated by these RBPs in the brain.

The length of the DNA sequences that can be 'read' by modern sequencing systems is substantially smaller than the length of most genomes (1000s of base-pairs versus millions to billions), making it virtually impossible to use the fragmented information generated by the shotgun sequencing process to reconstruct the long-range information linking together genomic segments belonging to a same chromosome. The main reason why genome assembly is difficult is genomic repeats - segments of DNA that occur in multiple identical or near-identical copies throughout a genome. Any repeats longer than the length of a sequencing read introduce ambiguity in the possible reconstructions of a genome - an exponential (in the number of repeats) number of different genomes can be constructed from the same set of reads, among which only one is the true reconstruction of the genome being assembled. Finding this one correct genome from among the many possible alternatives is impossible without the use of additional information, such as mate-pair information constraining the relative placement of pairs of shotgun reads along the genome. Mate-pair information is routinely generated in sequencing experiments and has been critical to scientists' ability to reconstruct genomes from shotgun data (e.g., mate-pair information was crucial to the success of the first prokaryotic genome project - Haemophilus influenza). Given these outstanding issues, a series of interlocking aims is proposed that center on enhanced optical and electronic detection of specially-decorated, genomic DNA molecules. The aims are designed for enabling new technologies that will provide sufficient physical map information to intimately mix with modern sequencing data for comprehensive assembly of complex genomes. These proposed advancements will be cradled within a new generation of nanofluidic devices engendering novel means for molecular control and detection. Such efforts will be directed by state-of-the art computer simulations that will model novel aspects of the new platforms for allowing rapid loops of design/implementation/testing. The main thrust of these technological developments will be carefully guided and serve a broad-based bioinformatics framework that will be developed for this work while laying the basis for highly integrated approaches to genome assembly and analysis.          Development of new machines and software is proposed, which will rapidly analyze a person's genome and reveal new types of information that doctors will be able to use for treating patients. The machines that will be developed are actually very small devices that may one day be sufficiently miniaturized to fit in a person's hand.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Determining the structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, as well as the first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to increase the power of two structure-determination methods, cryo-EM and NMR.

"Machine learning methods to increase genomic accessibility by next-gen sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): DNA sequencing has become an indispensable tool in many areas of biology and medicine. Recent techno- logical breakthroughs in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have made it possible to sequence billions of bases quickly and cheaply. A number of NGS-based tools have been created, including ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, Methyl- seq and exon/whole-genome sequencing, enabling a fundamentally new way of studying diseases, genomes and epigenomes. The widespread use of NGS-based methods calls for better and more efficient tools for the analysis and interpretation of the NGS high-throughput data. Although a number of computational tools have been devel- oped, they are insufficient in mapping and studying genome features located within repeat, duplicated and other so-called unmappable regions of genomes. In this project, computational algorithms and software that expand genomic accessibility of NGS to these previously understudied regions will be developed.  The algorithms will begin with a new way of mapping raw reads from NGS to the reference genome, followed by a machine learning method to resolve ambiguously mapped reads, and will be integrated into a comprehen- sive analysis pipeline for ChIP-seq. More specifically, the three aims of the research are to develop: (1) Data structures and efficient algorithms for read mapping to rapidly identify all mapping locations. Unlike existing methods, the focus of this research is to rapidly identify all candidate locations of each read, instead of one or only a few locations. (2) Machine learning algorithms for read analysis to resolve ambiguously mapped reads for both ChIP-seq analysis and genetic variation detection. This work will develop probabilistic models to resolve ambiguously mapped reads by pooling information from the entire collection of reads. (3) A comprehensive ChIP- seq analysis pipeline to systematically study genomic features located within unmappable regions of genomes. These algorithms will be tested and refined using both publicly available data and data from established wet-lab collaborators.  In addition to discovering new genomic features located within repeat, duplicated or other previously unac- cessible regions, this work will provide the NGS community with (a) a faster and more accurate tool for mapping short sequence reads, (b) a general methodology for expanding genomic accessibility of NGS, and (c) a versatile, modular, open-source toolbox of algorithms for NGS data analysis, (d) a comprehensive analysis of protein-DNA interactions in repeat regions in all publicly available ChIP-seq datasets.  This work is a close collaboration between computer scientists and web-lab biologists who are developing NGS assays to study biomedical problems. In particular, we will collaborate with Timothy Osborne of Sanford- Burnham Medical Research Institute to study regulators involved in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, with Kyoko Yokomori of UC Irvine to study Cohesin, Nipbl and their roles in Cornelia de Lange syndrome, and Ken Cho of UC Irvine to study the roles of FoxH1 and Schnurri in development and growth control.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DNA-sequencing has become an indispensable tool for basic biomedical research as well as for discovering new treatments and helping biomedical researchers understand disease mechanisms.

"Informatics Tools for High-Throughput Sequences Data Analysis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is a suite of best-in-class, widely-used, well-supported, open-source tools for processing and analysis of next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) data. These tools currently  include a multiple sequence realigner, a covariate-correcting base quality score recalibrator, multi-sample  SNP, INDEL, and CNV genotypers, machine learning algorithms for false positive identification, variant  evaluation modules, somatic SNP and indel callers, and hundreds of other tools. Underlying all of these tools is our structured programming framework (GATK-Engine) that uses the functional programming philosophy of MapReduce to make writing feature-rich, efficient and robust analysis tools easy. By centralizing common data management infrastructure, all GATK-based tools benefit from the engine's correctness, CPU and memory efficiency, as well as automatic distributed and shared memory parallelization, essential capabilities given the massive and growing size of NGS datasets. The GATK currently supports all of the major sequencing technologies including lllumina.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.          We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1). This screen will be used to identify therapeutic compounds that can be used to treat DM1.

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community. In particular, we will focus our new capabilities on three difficult function annotation challenges: ATP binding sites, phosphorylation sites, and metabolizing enzyme active sites.

"Computational genome-wide RNA profiling using next-generation sequencing     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent evidence has shown that non-coding RNAs are ubiquitous in the cell and that their functions and structure vary to a greater extent than previously imagined. Multiple new RNA classes have been implicated in many diseases, and understanding how these RNAs work is a critical need. While exciting discoveries are accumulating, our functional knowledge of these new RNAs remains limited. Here we propose to couple a new high-throughput RNA duplex sequencing technology with new, computational methods to economically study novel functional non-coding RNA at a genomic scale. We propose to develop two computational methodologies to characterize putative newly found non-coding RNAs on the genomic scale. First, we will develop a maximum likelihood approach that estimates RNA secondary structure using RNA-seq assays that preferentially sequence single- or double-stranded nucleotides. Second, we will develop a machine-learning framework that predicts the functional category of novel non-coding RNAs using length and structure features of known RNAs. These structural and functional predictions will be validated by comparative genomics and experimentation. We will develop databases and analysis software, and investigate the human genome and five other model organisms.

"Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with Applications to Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with  Applications to Classification and Differentiation Recent genomic sequencing advances, such as next generation sequencing, and projects like the Human Microbiome Project create extremely large genomic databases. Even though the length of any specific sequence may be much shorter than that of the complete DNA sequence of an organism, looking at enormous libraries of sequences, such as 16S rRNA, presents an equally (if not greater) computational challenge. In traditional genomic analysis, only one sequence may be analyzed at a time. When dealing with metagenomics, thousands (or more) sequences need to be analyzed at the same time. However, to study such problems as environmental biological diversity and human microbiome diversity this is exactly what is needed. Current techniques have several shortcomings which need to be addressed. Techniques involving sequence alignment are typically based on selection of one representative sequence (as is typically done when looking at 16S rRNA data) which introduces selection bias. Genomic databases involving multiple copies of 16S per organism across thousands of organisms, will soon grow too large to practically process just using computationally expensive alignment methods to match sequences, but faster alignment-free methods currently do not provide the needed accuracy and sensitivity. As a complement to existing methods we introduce a novel class of fast high-throughput algorithms based on quasi-alignment using position specific p-mer frequency clustering. Organisms are represented by a directed graph structure that summarizes the ordering between clusters of p-mer frequency histograms at different positions in sequences. This model can be learned using all available 16S copies of an organism and thus eliminates selection bias. Due to the added position information, these algorithms can be used for species (and even strain) classification facilitating the study of strain diversity within species. Our prototype implementation of this new technique shows that it is able to produce compact profiles which can be efficiently stored and used for large scale classification and differentiation down to the strain level. Since the technique incorporates high-throughput data stream clustering, a proven technique in high performance computing, it scales well for very large scale DNA/RNA sequence data as well as massive sets of short sequence snippets collected during metagenomic research. In this project we will develop a suite of tools, profile models, and scoring techniques to model RNA/DNA sequences providing applications of organism classification, and intra/inter-organism similarity/diversity. Our approach provides both the specificity needed to perform strain classification and still avoid the computational overhead of alignment. It is important to note that this is accomplished through dynamic online machine learning techniques without human intervention.           Recent advances in Metagenomics and the Human Microbiome provide a complex landscape for dealing with a multitude of genomes all at once. One of the many challenges in this field is classification of the genomes present in the sample. Effective metagenomic classification and diversity analysis require complex representations of taxa. The significance of our research is that we develop a suite of tools, based on novel alignment free techniques that will be applied to environmental metagenomics samples as well as human microbiome samples. Providing such methods to rapidly classify organisms using our new approach on a laptop computer instead of several multi-processor servers will facilitate the rapid development of microbiome-based health screening in the near future.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases. The proposed study is to investigate the fundamentals of neuronal RNA complexity at the systems level, using a combination of high-throughput experimental technologies and novel integrative computational methods.

"Functional RNA elements in the human genome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-mRNA splicing is essential for proper gene expression in higher eukaryotic genomes, as the vast majority of genes contain introns that have to be accurately recognized and removed. Recent studies have revealed that >90% of the genes undergo alternative splicing, which is believed to contribute to the complexity of the proteome in different cell types and tissues in vertebrates and abundant evidence suggests that altered splicing causes a variety of human diseases. Despite extensive knowledge on the splicing mechanism based on biochemical dissection of model minigenes, we know little about how many genes are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and where the functional RNA elements are embedded in the human genome.  Built on our productive research in the current award period, we now propose a bold plan to systematically attack the critical gap of our knowledge about the regulation of alternative splicing. We will pursue three major lines of research by utilizing the latest and innovative genomics technologies. (1) We will use a new, automated platform recently developed in our lab to profile hundreds of conserved alternative splicing events against every annotated genes in the human genome. This unbiased approach will generate unprecedented information to uncover novel splicing regulators and deduce pathways in regulated splicing. (2) We will focus on RNA binding proteins involved in individual regulatory pathways to elucidate the molecular basis for regulated splicing by mapping their physical interactions with expressed RNA. For this purpose, we will construct a large panel of cell lines based on FLP-In 293 cells to express individual RNA binding proteins as a V5-tagged protein at the C- terminus, which will permit large-scale mapping of RNA-protein interactions by CLIP-seq (CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing) under a similar and optimized set of conditions. (3) Our third goal is to use the information generated from the proposed mapping and functional studies to develop an integrated framework for de novo prediction of splicing regulation by using machine-learning and graphical models. This research has the potential to fundamentally change our view on splicing control and its contribution to human disease.       This RNA genomics project aims to deduce the splicing code in the human genome by systematic determination of genes involved in regulated splicing, elucidation of regulatory pathways, and RNA-protein interactions. The proposed research will use the latest genomics technologies to reveal functional RNA elements in the human genome, which will provide the molecular basis for many RNA-related human diseases.",Functional RNA elements in the human genome,8326595,R01HG004659,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Award', 'Beryllium', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cistrons', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Development', 'Dissection', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Eukaryota', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exons', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins', 'Human', 'Human Cell Line', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Indium', 'Individual', 'Introns', 'Knowledge', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'RNA', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Relative (related person)', 'Reporter', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Tissues', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost effective', 'crosslink', 'empowered', 'functional group', 'functional outcomes', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'homologous recombination', 'human disease', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mRNA Precursor', 'mammalian genome', 'new technology', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'response']",NHGRI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2012,680000,0.0038945576821617527
"Structure based prediction of the interactome     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Molecular interactions play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and protein-RNA interactions (PRIs) are of particular interest as they are critical in maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Although high-throughput experimental PPI and PRI data is rapidly accumulating, building complete and confident datasets requires multiple replicates of expensive screens. This proposal aims to develop new methods that will significantly advance our efforts at structure-based approaches to better predict PPIs and RPIs and boost confidence in emerging high-throughput (HTP) data with the goal of comprehensive interactome mapping at lower cost. Taken together, these methods will vastly expand our understanding of macromolecular networks. We will continue to devise structure-based methods for protein-protein interaction prediction and branch out to methods for protein-RNA interaction prediction; this represents a major shift from the purely sequence-based approaches that most bioinformatics approaches utilize to predict  We will also build computational frameworks for boosting confidence in HTP protein-protein and protein-RNA interaction datasets using structure-based approaches; these frameworks will provide a comprehensive assessment of in-house and public HTP data, with potential biomedical applications such as heat shock protein-kinase interactions related to development for cancer therapeutics, MAPK6's role in a cancer-related signaling network, and (long non-coding) RNA-protein binding roles in neurodegenerative disease. Finally, we will computationally screen for PPIs and PRIs at the genome scale and expand our Struct2Net webserver to disseminate tools based on our methods and results to the community. An increasing number of HTP interaction datasets are being determined, thus presenting new opportunities to leverage this data in conjunction with structural insights to map binding sites and to uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms of cellular functions. molecular interactions and will enhance coverage and accuracy of the complete interactome. Successful completion of these aims will result in computational methods that will significantly increase our confidence in high-throughput data on protein-protein and protein-RNA interactions and will reveal fundamental aspects of their functioning, as well as testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. All developed software will be made publicly available.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Biological processes are carried out through thousands of interactions between various types of molecules (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication.

"Defining the messenger RNP code in the brain     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with functional RNA elements embedded within pre- and mature messenger RNA to form messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes. These interactions result in the faithful execution of RNA processing events such as pre-mRNA alternative splicing, RNA stability and translational control. Aberrant alterations in the interactions between the RBPs and their RNA elements ultimately lead to behavioral abnormalities and neurological developmental defects, which can often manifest as fatal diseases such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or life-long debilitating behavioral abnormalities such as Prader-Willi/Angelman Syndromes, Schizophrenia and Autism Spectrum Disorder. These findings underscore the importance of investigating the roles of these RBPs in the brain. In particular, our project is aimed at systematically, using genome-wide biochemical and bioinformatic assays, identifying the functional RNA elements that are recognized by RBPs in mouse brain and human neurons. We will develop a novel resource of human pluripotent stem cells stably expressing tagged RBPs that can be differentiated into human neurons. This will enable the identification of RNA binding sites of 50 RBPs in human neural RNAs in a uniform and systematic manner using cutting-edge genomic approaches such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (CLIP- seq). To reveal the splicing, stability, and translational changes that are dependent on direct binding of these RBPs we will perform high-throughput sequencing of mRNAs (RNA-seq) and ribosome-protected fragments (RPFs). Finally, we will leverage our computational expertise to build predictive models using this genome-wide, multi-scale, mRNP code in the brain.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Over the last decade, defects in RNA binding proteins (RBPs) themselves or the interactions between RNA binding sites of RBPs have become recognized as increasingly responsible for neurological disease and mental disorders.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.

"New Physical Methodologies for Genomic Analysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite substantial efforts in developing sequencing technologies and computational software, spanning over 30 years, the full genome of any but the simplest organisms is still unable to automatically reconstructed. The length of the DNA sequences that can be 'read' by modern sequencing systems is substantially smaller than the length of most genomes (1000s of base-pairs versus millions to billions), making it virtually impossible to use the fragmented information generated by the shotgun sequencing process to reconstruct the long-range information linking together genomic segments belonging to a same chromosome. The main reason why genome assembly is difficult is genomic repeats - segments of DNA that occur in multiple identical or near-identical copies throughout a genome. Any repeats longer than the length of a sequencing read introduce ambiguity in the possible reconstructions of a genome - an exponential (in the number of repeats) number of different genomes can be constructed from the same set of reads, among which only one is the true reconstruction of the genome being assembled. Finding this one correct genome from among the many possible alternatives is impossible without the use of additional information, such as mate-pair information constraining the relative placement of pairs of shotgun reads along the genome. Mate-pair information is routinely generated in sequencing experiments and has been critical to scientists' ability to reconstruct genomes from shotgun data (e.g., mate-pair information was crucial to the success of the first prokaryotic genome project - Haemophilus influenza). Given these outstanding issues, a series of interlocking aims is proposed that center on enhanced optical and electronic detection of specially-decorated, genomic DNA molecules. The aims are designed for enabling new technologies that will provide sufficient physical map information to intimately mix with modern sequencing data for comprehensive assembly of complex genomes. These proposed advancements will be cradled within a new generation of nanofluidic devices engendering novel means for molecular control and detection. Such efforts will be directed by state-of-the art computer simulations that will model novel aspects of the new platforms for allowing rapid loops of design/implementation/testing. The main thrust of these technological developments will be carefully guided and serve a broad-based bioinformatics framework that will be developed for this work while laying the basis for highly integrated approaches to genome assembly and analysis.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Development of new machines and software is proposed, which will rapidly analyze a person's genome and reveal new types of information that doctors will be able to use for treating patients.

"Identification of Therapeutic Small Molecules for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myotonic dystrophy (DM1) is the most common adult onset muscular dystrophy in humans. Currently, there is no cure or an FDA approved drug for DM1 and related diseases. DM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from the expansion of a CTG-repeat sequence in the 3' untranslated region of the DMPK gene. This defect results in the expression of mutant DMPK RNAs encoding expanded CUG repeats (CUGexp) that form large intra nuclear RNA-protein complexes or foci. Expression of CUGexp RNAs leads to abnormal RNA splicing, which in turn has been linked to the development of key features of DM1 pathology. We hypothesize that small molecules that degrade or disperse CUGexp RNAs in DM1 cells can re-establish normal splice patterns and reverse DM1 pathology. To test this hypothesis, we have developed a primary HTS and a secondary hit validation assay to identify small-molecules that selectively alter the biology of DMPK CUGexp RNAs without affecting the normal DMPK transcripts. Our in house library was developed using a robust machine learning chemoinformatics platform and consists of 40,000 highly diverse small-molecules representing a library of several million compounds. Preliminary results obtained from a screen of 2,500 compounds demonstrate that our strategy allows the rapid identification of potent molecules that successfully reverse DM1 pathology in both patient cells and DM1 mouse models. In a concerted effort to identify a set of potent lead compounds that can be developed as a therapeutic cocktail for DM1 we propose the following Aims: Aim 1. Implement primary HTS and the secondary hit validation assay to screen 20,000 molecules from our in-house library. Aim 2. Test hits in tertiary DM1 patient cell-based assays to identify highly potent leads that reverse five key cellular DM1 phenotypes. Selectivity, toxicity and synergy of leads will be measured in parallel. Aim 3. The chemical structure of lead compounds will be reiteratively refined to optimize pharmacological properties and establish structure-activity relationships.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We have developed a HTS screen to identify compounds that alter the biology of toxic CUGexp RNAs in myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1).

"Annotating Functional Sites in 3D Biological Structures    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Project Summary/Abstract Dramatic advances in our understanding of molecular structure and function promise to accelerate the creation of new diagnostics and therapeutics. However the link between the structure of a biological macromolecule and its function is usually not obvious: fundamental to understanding how a molecule functions is an understanding of how its structure behaves over time. Recent advances in molecular dynamics simulations now allow the rapid collection of information about structural motion. These data sets are huge, and require statistical machine learning algorithms to characterize and recognize patterns relevant to function. The National Library of Medicine's new long-range plan calls for research in the use of advanced simulation and machine learning algorithms in support of biomedical research.       This proposal focuses on annotating molecular structures with missing or incomplete functional information. We are particularly interested in identifying binding sites and active sites in proteins. We bring together simulation and machine learning, and hypothesize that the performance of structure- based function annotation methods will dramatically improve with the addition of information about dynamics. Thus, our specific aims are (1) to develop methods for recognizing function from structural dynamics and diversity, (2) to develop capabilities for large scale clustering and analysis tools for the discovery of novel functions, and (3) to apply our tools to challenging and important biological systems, while disseminating our software, data and capabilities to the biomedical research community.

"What Made Us Human?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative genomics promises to shed light on those genetic changes that gave rise to the modern human species. Mounting evidence suggests that the vast majority of functional differences between the human and chimpanzee genomes are in regions that do not code for proteins. Focusing on these non-coding regions, we will investigate lineage-specific evolution in the human genome. Our approach includes developing likelihood ratio tests for identifying changes in either the rate or the pattern of nucleotide substitution in a single lineage. These novel methods will be implemented in open source software that can be used to scan an entire genome. We will apply this evolutionary analysis to multiple sequence alignments of human and other vertebrates, including several closely related species (macaque, chimpanzee, Neanderthal), allowing us to identify recent changes in the human genome. In order to concentrate on functionally relevant changes, evolutionary testing will be limited to sets of candidate regions with specific known or predicted functions (e.g. regulatory regions, RNA genes). Predicted functional regions will be identified using machine learning classification techniques. These classifiers will employ measures of sequence conservation as well as the rapidly expanding collection of experimental and bioinformatic annotations of the human genome, including results of the ENCODE Project and other functional genomic studies. After identifying those regions that were most significantly altered in the human lineage, we will use this functional information to develop testable hypotheses about the effects of the observed changes. Experimental investigations of these genomic regions will lead to new understanding of the evolution of human biology and health.       PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project will vastly expand knowledge of biologically relevant features of the human genome that are unique to our species. Identification and characterization of the genetic changes leading to modern humans is of fundamental interest. These investigations also promise to contribute to our understanding of the causal mechanisms behind human diseases, leading to directed treatment and prevention strategies.          n/a",What Made Us Human?,8134360,R01GM082901,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Bioinformatics', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Evolution', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pan Genus', 'Pattern', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Domains', 'Relative (related person)', 'Ribonucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'comparative genomics', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'open source', 'simulation', 'trait', 'treatment strategy']",NIGMS,J.

"Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with Applications to Classification    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Position Sensitive P-Mer Frequency Clustering with  Applications to Classification and Differentiation Recent genomic sequencing advances, such as next generation sequencing, and projects like the Human Microbiome Project create extremely large genomic databases. Even though the length of any specific sequence may be much shorter than that of the complete DNA sequence of an organism, looking at enormous libraries of sequences, such as 16S rRNA, presents an equally (if not greater) computational challenge. In traditional genomic analysis, only one sequence may be analyzed at a time. When dealing with metagenomics, thousands (or more) sequences need to be analyzed at the same time. However, to study such problems as environmental biological diversity and human microbiome diversity this is exactly what is needed. Current techniques have several shortcomings which need to be addressed. Techniques involving sequence alignment are typically based on selection of one representative sequence (as is typically done when looking at 16S rRNA data) which introduces selection bias. Genomic databases involving multiple copies of 16S per organism across thousands of organisms, will soon grow too large to practically process just using computationally expensive alignment methods to match sequences, but faster alignment-free methods currently do not provide the needed accuracy and sensitivity. As a complement to existing methods we introduce a novel class of fast high-throughput algorithms based on quasi-alignment using position specific p-mer frequency clustering. Organisms are represented by a directed graph structure that summarizes the ordering between clusters of p-mer frequency histograms at different positions in sequences. This model can be learned using all available 16S copies of an organism and thus eliminates selection bias. Due to the added position information, these algorithms can be used for species (and even strain) classification facilitating the study of strain diversity within species. Our prototype implementation of this new technique shows that it is able to produce compact profiles which can be efficiently stored and used for large scale classification and differentiation down to the strain level. Since the technique incorporates high-throughput data stream clustering, a proven technique in high performance computing, it scales well for very large scale DNA/RNA sequence data as well as massive sets of short sequence snippets collected during metagenomic research. In this project we will develop a suite of tools, profile models, and scoring techniques to model RNA/DNA sequences providing applications of organism classification, and intra/inter-organism similarity/diversity. Our approach provides both the specificity needed to perform strain classification and still avoid the computational overhead of alignment. It is important to note that this is accomplished through dynamic online machine learning techniques without human intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Recent advances in Metagenomics and the Human Microbiome provide a complex landscape for dealing with a multitude of genomes all at once. One of the many challenges in this field is classification of the genomes present in the sample. Effective metagenomic classification and diversity analysis require complex representations of taxa. The significance of our research is that we develop a suite of tools, based on novel alignment free techniques that will be applied to environmental metagenomics samples as well as human microbiome samples. Providing such methods to rapidly classify organisms using our new approach on a laptop computer instead of several multi-processor servers will facilitate the rapid development of microbiome-based health screening in the near future.                 Recent advances in Metagenomics and the Human Microbiome provide a complex landscape for dealing with a multitude of genomes all at once.

"An integrative genomic strategy to infer global RNA regulatory networks    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is increasingly recognized that mammalian biologic complexity is amplified enormously by the regulation of RNA complexity. This regulation is mediated by hundreds of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) through sequence-specific interactions with their targets. Misregulation of RNAs can cause a number of genetic diseases. Despite their critical roles, efforts to study RNA complexity are largely impeded by the difficulty to accurately infer global RNA-regulatory networks, due to deficiencies of high-throughput experimental technologies and effective computational methods. This application describes a combination of experimental and computational approaches to advance the understanding of in vivo RNA regulation in mammalian brains at the systems level. On the experimental side, I will take advantage of the mouse genetic systems and high-throughput technologies established in the Robert Darnell laboratory at Rockefeller University, where the mentored phase of research will be performed. HITS-CLIP will be used to generate genome-wide maps of biochemical footprints of several important neuronal RBPs; exon-junction microarrays and RNA-Seq will be used to generate nucleotide-resolution transcriptome profiles for comparative analysis of wild type brains and brains lacking individual RBPs, and of developing mouse brains. On the computational side, integrative modeling techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Bayesian networks, will be employed to probabilistically model biochemical, structural, genomic, and evolutionary information from multiple data sources, so that highly predictive models of RBP/miRNA target sites and RNA-regulatory networks can be developed. Substantial preliminary data have been obtained from the analysis of RNA splicing regulation by Nova, which demonstrates the effectiveness of such an integrative genomic strategy to define accurate and comprehensive RNA-regulatory networks and obtain novel biological insights. Here I propose to further improve these methods, and extend the strategy to other RBPs, individually or in combination, and other steps of RNA regulation. The regulatory mechanisms discovered in genetically engineered systems will be further extended to study the combinatorial and dynamic RNA regulation in developing brains and in different brain regions. While I have received extensive training in machine learning and computational studies of RNA regulation, this career development award will allow me to expand my existing skills and continue to develop my experimental skills. The excellent environment in the Darnell lab and Rockefeller University will greatly facilitate not only the mentored research, but also my transition to an independent academic position. Together, the proposed study will pave the road to launch my future investigations that aim to decode rules governing RNA regulation in normal biological processes and human diseases.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: RNA regulation is critical for the diversification of mammalian gene expression, organism complexity, and human diseases.

"Functional RNA elements in the human genome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-mRNA splicing is essential for proper gene expression in higher eukaryotic genomes, as the vast majority of genes contain introns that have to be accurately recognized and removed. Recent studies have revealed that >90% of the genes undergo alternative splicing, which is believed to contribute to the complexity of the proteome in different cell types and tissues in vertebrates and abundant evidence suggests that altered splicing causes a variety of human diseases. Despite extensive knowledge on the splicing mechanism based on biochemical dissection of model minigenes, we know little about how many genes are involved in the regulation of alternative splicing and where the functional RNA elements are embedded in the human genome.  Built on our productive research in the current award period, we now propose a bold plan to systematically attack the critical gap of our knowledge about the regulation of alternative splicing. We will pursue three major lines of research by utilizing the latest and innovative genomics technologies. (1) We will use a new, automated platform recently developed in our lab to profile hundreds of conserved alternative splicing events against every annotated genes in the human genome. This unbiased approach will generate unprecedented information to uncover novel splicing regulators and deduce pathways in regulated splicing. (2) We will focus on RNA binding proteins involved in individual regulatory pathways to elucidate the molecular basis for regulated splicing by mapping their physical interactions with expressed RNA. For this purpose, we will construct a large panel of cell lines based on FLP-In 293 cells to express individual RNA binding proteins as a V5-tagged protein at the C- terminus, which will permit large-scale mapping of RNA-protein interactions by CLIP-seq (CrossLinking ImmunoPrecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing) under a similar and optimized set of conditions. (3) Our third goal is to use the information generated from the proposed mapping and functional studies to develop an integrated framework for de novo prediction of splicing regulation by using machine-learning and graphical models. This research has the potential to fundamentally change our view on splicing control and its contribution to human disease.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This RNA genomics project aims to deduce the splicing code in the human genome by systematic determination of genes involved in regulated splicing, elucidation of regulatory pathways, and RNA-protein interactions.

"A Comprehensive catalog of human DNasel hypersensitive sites The overall aim of this proposal is to establish a comprehensive, high-quality catalogue of human DNasel hypersensitive sites (DHSs) spanning all major tissue lineages.

"Structure-Based Prediction of the Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Although high-throughput biochemical approaches for discovering PPIs have proven very successful, the current experimental coverage of the interactome remains inadequate and would benefit from computational tools. The broad, long term goal of this proposal is to harness the information provided by structure-based computational approaches as a potentially high-quality, high-coverage data source for large-scale integrative approaches to interactome construction. Specifically, this project aims to: 1) develop new structure-based prediction methods that can be applied on a genome scale, and 2) integrate these predictions with other functional genomic information to predict PPIs at a genome scale. This project will also generate testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. A key product of the proposed research is the LTHREADER program, a localized threading program that will simultaneously align query sequence-pairs to templates of protein-protein interfaces. By exploiting information contained in the protein complex interfaces, it may significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art in coverage and prediction quality. Some of the core computational aspects are the development of algorithms for threading query sequence-pairs to templates (using linear programming), learning statistical potentials (SVMs), and combining multiple protein interface scores for PPI prediction (boosting). The output from such structure-based approaches will be combined with other functional genomic data in the Struct2Net framework for predicting PPIs (using random forests). A final product of the proposed research will be a comprehensive database of genome-wide PPI predictions derived from purely structure-based as well as integrative approaches. The database will also include extracellular ligand-receptor interactions.       The prediction of PPIs will enable better elucidation of extracellular and intracellular signaling networks, which has direct medical implications in terms of drug target identification. For example, a promising public-health application of this research is the rational design of therapeutics which inhibit or interfere with the binding of extracellular ligands to receptors. All the produced computational algorithms, software, and databases will be made publicly available for further studies.Relevance       Proteins interact with each other to communicate within and between cells, forming networks (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem.

"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements.

The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome.

Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site.

"Identification and characterization of non-coding RNAs in diverse bacteria My long-term goal is to become a leading independent investigator heading a truly interdisciplinary group that integrates cutting-edge bioinformatic approaches with innovative wet-bench methodologies to better understand RNA-mediated regulation, particularly in the context of bacterial pathogenesis. In the mentored phase of this award, I created and employed a high-throughput computational program called SIPHT to identify and annotate regulatory RNAs (regRNAs) and utilized data from cDNA deep sequencing experiments to determine a comprehensive profile of the V. cholerae small transcriptome. In the independent phase of the award, I plan to improve upon these computational and experimental approaches and to extend their application to a wider variety of bacterial species. Aim I is to develop an improved version of SIPHT that automatically updates its databases to enable regRNA predictions and annotations in newly sequenced strains and to incorporate newly identified regRNAs into predictive searches. Aim II Is to use Iterative SIPHT searches and machine learning techniques to improve the reliability of regRNA predictions and annotations. The studies proposed in Aim III have two main objectives. The first is to utilize massively parallel sequencing of the M. tuberculosis, V. cholerae, and P. aeruginosa transcriptomes to identify novel regRNAs and to elucidate RNA-mediated regulatory responses to specific environmental stresses and cues. The second is to develop bioinformatic algorithms to identify novel regRNAs from within the large datasets produced by deep sequencing techniques. Finally, Aim IV is to improve upon current predictive algorithms for trans-acting small regRNAs (sRNAs) by determining a consensus motif for the binding sites of the RNA chaperone Hfq and utilizing this motif in the search for previously unknown sRNAencoding genes. The proposed studies will likely lead to the discovery and functional annotation of numerous regRNAs. Moreover, the approaches described will be useful in the study of RNA-mediated regulation in a wide variety of bacterial species. Numerous recent studies have implicated a role for regRNAs in mediating the virulence of bacterial pathogens. Thus, identifying and characterizing regRNAs In a wider variety of species, in addition to providing insights Into myriad basic biological processes, will likely lead to a better understanding of microbial pathogenesis that may ultimately aid in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. n/a",Identification and characterization of non-coding RNAs in diverse bacteria,7924186,R00AI076608,"['Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Complementary DNA', 'Consensus', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Update', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Virulence', 'genome sequencing', 'improved', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'research study', 'response']",NIAID,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R00,2010,246510,0.005575072768997825

"What Made Us Human?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative genomics promises to shed light on those genetic changes that gave rise to the modern human species. Mounting evidence suggests that the vast majority of functional differences between the human and chimpanzee genomes are in regions that do not code for proteins. Focusing on these non-coding regions, we will investigate lineage-specific evolution in the human genome. Our approach includes developing likelihood ratio tests for identifying changes in either the rate or the pattern of nucleotide substitution in a single lineage. These novel methods will be implemented in open source software that can be used to scan an entire genome. We will apply this evolutionary analysis to multiple sequence alignments of human and other vertebrates, including several closely related species (macaque, chimpanzee, Neanderthal), allowing us to identify recent changes in the human genome. In order to concentrate on functionally relevant changes, evolutionary testing will be limited to sets of candidate regions with specific known or predicted functions (e.g. regulatory regions, RNA genes). Predicted functional regions will be identified using machine learning classification techniques. These classifiers will employ measures of sequence conservation as well as the rapidly expanding collection of experimental and bioinformatic annotations of the human genome, including results of the ENCODE Project and other functional genomic studies. After identifying those regions that were most significantly altered in the human lineage, we will use this functional information to develop testable hypotheses about the effects of the observed changes. Experimental investigations of these genomic regions will lead to new understanding of the evolution of human biology and health.       PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project will vastly expand knowledge of biologically relevant features of the human genome that are unique to our species. Identification and characterization of the genetic changes leading to modern humans is of fundamental interest.

"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7825413,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'therapeutic development', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NEVADA LAS VEGAS,R01,2010,273781,-0.016818470732629823
"Structure-Based Prediction of the Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Although high-throughput biochemical approaches for discovering PPIs have proven very successful, the current experimental coverage of the interactome remains inadequate and would benefit from computational tools. The broad, long term goal of this proposal is to harness the information provided by structure-based computational approaches as a potentially high-quality, high-coverage data source for large-scale integrative approaches to interactome construction. Specifically, this project aims to: 1) develop new structure-based prediction methods that can be applied on a genome scale, and 2) integrate these predictions with other functional genomic information to predict PPIs at a genome scale. This project will also generate testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. A key product of the proposed research is the LTHREADER program, a localized threading program that will simultaneously align query sequence-pairs to templates of protein-protein interfaces. By exploiting information contained in the protein complex interfaces, it may significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art in coverage and prediction quality. Some of the core computational aspects are the development of algorithms for threading query sequence-pairs to templates (using linear programming), learning statistical potentials (SVMs), and combining multiple protein interface scores for PPI prediction (boosting). The output from such structure-based approaches will be combined with other functional genomic data in the Struct2Net framework for predicting PPIs (using random forests). A final product of the proposed research will be a comprehensive database of genome-wide PPI predictions derived from purely structure-based as well as integrative approaches. The database will also include extracellular ligand-receptor interactions.       The prediction of PPIs will enable better elucidation of extracellular and intracellular signaling networks, which has direct medical implications in terms of drug target identification. For example, a promising public-health application of this research is the rational design of therapeutics which inhibit or interfere with the binding of extracellular ligands to receptors. All the produced computational algorithms, software, and databases will be made publicly available for further studies.Relevance       Proteins interact with each other to communicate within and between cells, forming networks (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data.

The second is to develop bioinformatic algorithms to identify novel regRNAs from within the large datasets produced by deep sequencing techniques. Finally, Aim IV is to improve upon current predictive algorithms for trans-acting small regRNAs (sRNAs) by determining a consensus motif for the binding sites of the RNA chaperone Hfq and utilizing this motif in the search for previously unknown sRNAencoding genes. The proposed studies will likely lead to the discovery and functional annotation of numerous regRNAs. Moreover, the approaches described will be useful in the study of RNA-mediated regulation in a wide variety of bacterial species. Numerous recent studies have implicated a role for regRNAs in mediating the virulence of bacterial pathogens. Thus, identifying and characterizing regRNAs In a wider variety of species, in addition to providing insights Into myriad basic biological processes, will likely lead to a better understanding of microbial pathogenesis that may ultimately aid in the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases. n/a",Identification and characterization of non-coding RNAs in diverse bacteria,7907308,R00AI076608,"['Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Process', 'Complementary DNA', 'Consensus', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Functional RNA', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mycobacterium tuberculosis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Phase', 'Prevention', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'RNA', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Update', 'Vibrio cholerae', 'Virulence', 'improved', 'infectious disease treatment', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microbial', 'novel', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'research study', 'response']",NIAID,"BROAD INSTITUTE, INC.",R00,2009,249000,0.005575072768997825

"What Made Us Human?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative genomics promises to shed light on those genetic changes that gave rise to the modern human species. Mounting evidence suggests that the vast majority of functional differences between the human and chimpanzee genomes are in regions that do not code for proteins. Focusing on these non-coding regions, we will investigate lineage-specific evolution in the human genome. Our approach includes developing likelihood ratio tests for identifying changes in either the rate or the pattern of nucleotide substitution in a single lineage. These novel methods will be implemented in open source software that can be used to scan an entire genome. We will apply this evolutionary analysis to multiple sequence alignments of human and other vertebrates, including several closely related species (macaque, chimpanzee, Neanderthal), allowing us to identify recent changes in the human genome. In order to concentrate on functionally relevant changes, evolutionary testing will be limited to sets of candidate regions with specific known or predicted functions (e.g. regulatory regions, RNA genes). Predicted functional regions will be identified using machine learning classification techniques. These classifiers will employ measures of sequence conservation as well as the rapidly expanding collection of experimental and bioinformatic annotations of the human genome, including results of the ENCODE Project and other functional genomic studies. After identifying those regions that were most significantly altered in the human lineage, we will use this functional information to develop testable hypotheses about the effects of the observed changes. Experimental investigations of these genomic regions will lead to new understanding of the evolution of human biology and health.       PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project will vastly expand knowledge of biologically relevant features of the human genome that are unique to our species. Identification and characterization of the genetic changes leading to modern humans is of fundamental interest. These investigations also promise to contribute to our understanding of the causal mechanisms behind human diseases, leading to directed treatment and prevention strategies.          n/a",What Made Us Human?,7681225,R01GM082901,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Bioinformatics', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Evolution', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pan Genus', 'Pattern', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Domains', 'Relative (related person)', 'Ribonucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'comparative', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'open source', 'simulation', 'trait']",NIGMS,J.

"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed.

"Structure-Based Prediction of the Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Although high-throughput biochemical approaches for discovering PPIs have proven very successful, the current experimental coverage of the interactome remains inadequate and would benefit from computational tools. The broad, long term goal of this proposal is to harness the information provided by structure-based computational approaches as a potentially high-quality, high-coverage data source for large-scale integrative approaches to interactome construction. Specifically, this project aims to: 1) develop new structure-based prediction methods that can be applied on a genome scale, and 2) integrate these predictions with other functional genomic information to predict PPIs at a genome scale. This project will also generate testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. A key product of the proposed research is the LTHREADER program, a localized threading program that will simultaneously align query sequence-pairs to templates of protein-protein interfaces. By exploiting information contained in the protein complex interfaces, it may significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art in coverage and prediction quality. Some of the core computational aspects are the development of algorithms for threading query sequence-pairs to templates (using linear programming), learning statistical potentials (SVMs), and combining multiple protein interface scores for PPI prediction (boosting). The output from such structure-based approaches will be combined with other functional genomic data in the Struct2Net framework for predicting PPIs (using random forests). A final product of the proposed research will be a comprehensive database of genome-wide PPI predictions derived from purely structure-based as well as integrative approaches. The database will also include extracellular ligand-receptor interactions.       The prediction of PPIs will enable better elucidation of extracellular and intracellular signaling networks, which has direct medical implications in terms of drug target identification. For example, a promising public-health application of this research is the rational design of therapeutics which inhibit or interfere with the binding of extracellular ligands to receptors. All the produced computational algorithms, software, and databases will be made publicly available for further studies.Relevance       Proteins interact with each other to communicate within and between cells, forming networks (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication.

"Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) and 2D NMR spectroscopy are methods for observing the three-dimensional structures of large and small macromolecules. respectively. We propose to develop and apply novel algorithms for solving the difficult mathematical problems posed by these techniques of structural biology. In cryo-EM the experimental data consist of noisy, random projection images of macromolecular ""particles"", and the problem is finding the 3D structure which is consistent with these images. Present reconstruction techniques rely on user input or ad hoc models to initiate a refinement cycle. We propose a new algorithm, ""globally consistent angular reconstitution"" (GCAR) that provides an unbiased and direct solution to the reconstruction problem. We further propose an extension to GCAR to handle heterogeneous particle populations. We also will pursue a powerful new approach to determining class averages, ""triplet class averaging"". This should allow GCAR to be used with data having very low signal-to-noise ratios, as is commonly obtained. The experimental data from NMR consist of estimates of local distances between atoms, and the goal is to find a globally consistent coordinate system. The same theory behind GCAR, involving the properties of sparse linear operators, can be applied to obtain a fast and direct solution to the distance geometry problem. We will develop and implement all of these algorithms and test them with experimental cryo-EM and NMR data. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Determining the structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, as well as the first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to increase the power of two structure-determination methods, cryo-EM and NMR.           n/a",Improved algorithms for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-EM and NMR,7787325,R01GM090200,"['Affinity', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Biological Process', 'Chemicals', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Discipline', 'Drug Design', 'Failure', 'Filtration', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Muscle Rigidity', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Negative Staining', 'Noise', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Potassium Channel', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Radial', 'Recovery', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Solutions', 'Spiders', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Torsion', 'Triplet Multiple Birth', 'Variant', 'base', 'data mining', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'macromolecule', 'mathematical theory', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'particle', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'protein structure', 'public health relevance', 'receptor', 'reconstitution', 'reconstruction', 'structural biology', 'success', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,293039,-0.01336897166018045
"Identification of Transcriptional Factor Binding Sites in Human Promoters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Transcriptional regulation is a highly coordinated process in the human genome. A significant component of transcriptional regulation is the interaction between transcriptional factor proteins (TFs) and cis-regulatory DNA elements. The goal of this project is to computationally predict and experimentally validate DNA sequence motifs that explain promoter function. The results of this project will be direct functional measurements of sequence motifs at base-pair resolution. This will yield extremely valuable information to assess the sensitivity and specificity of algorithms that can be immediately applied to the whole genome. These results will also help to identify the proportion of functionally relevant transcription factor binding events. The three aims of our project are: Aim 1: We will use two machine learning algorithms (support vector machines and random forest) to determine a subset of known transcription factor binding motifs that are the most predictive of promoter activities. Aim 2: We will then use Bayesian networks to select the most predictive motif features. These features are the strengths of the motif using PSSM and the positions of individual sites relative to each other and the transcription start site. Aim 3: We will then perform mutagenesis of the informative positions within the 900 sites identified in Aim 2, and measure their promoter activities by using transient transfection assays.

"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,7469442,R01GM072740,"['Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Class', 'Computer Analysis', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Dependence', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Exons', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Guanine + Cytosine Composition', 'Hereditary Disease', 'Heterogeneous Nuclear RNA', 'Human', 'Intervention', 'Introns', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammalian Cell', 'Numbers', 'Online Systems', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'RNA Splicing', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Work', 'base', 'design', 'falls', 'genetic selection', 'mRNA Precursor', 'novel', 'prevent', 'programs', 'size', 'solid state']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2008,291756,0.027038010407307324
"What Made Us Human?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Comparative genomics promises to shed light on those genetic changes that gave rise to the modern human species. Mounting evidence suggests that the vast majority of functional differences between the human and chimpanzee genomes are in regions that do not code for proteins. Focusing on these non-coding regions, we will investigate lineage-specific evolution in the human genome. Our approach includes developing likelihood ratio tests for identifying changes in either the rate or the pattern of nucleotide substitution in a single lineage. These novel methods will be implemented in open source software that can be used to scan an entire genome. We will apply this evolutionary analysis to multiple sequence alignments of human and other vertebrates, including several closely related species (macaque, chimpanzee, Neanderthal), allowing us to identify recent changes in the human genome. In order to concentrate on functionally relevant changes, evolutionary testing will be limited to sets of candidate regions with specific known or predicted functions (e.g. regulatory regions, RNA genes). Predicted functional regions will be identified using machine learning classification techniques. These classifiers will employ measures of sequence conservation as well as the rapidly expanding collection of experimental and bioinformatic annotations of the human genome, including results of the ENCODE Project and other functional genomic studies. After identifying those regions that were most significantly altered in the human lineage, we will use this functional information to develop testable hypotheses about the effects of the observed changes. Experimental investigations of these genomic regions will lead to new understanding of the evolution of human biology and health.       PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project will vastly expand knowledge of biologically relevant features of the human genome that are unique to our species. Identification and characterization of the genetic changes leading to modern humans is of fundamental interest. These investigations also promise to contribute to our understanding of the causal mechanisms behind human diseases, leading to directed treatment and prevention strategies.          n/a",What Made Us Human?,7522602,R01GM082901,"['Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Bioinformatics', 'Categories', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Evolution', 'Functional RNA', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Human Genome', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Pan Genus', 'Pan troglodytes', 'Pattern', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Public Domains', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Ribonucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Scanning', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vertebrates', 'base', 'comparative', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'open source', 'simulation', 'trait']",NIGMS,J.

"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7380093,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R01,2008,280033,-0.016818470732629823
"A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and dynamics of DNA duplex ends can influence numerous enzyme-dependent processes such as transposition of phage Mu, and integration of HIV dsDNA copies into target chromosomal DNA. Despite their critical importance in biology, DNA duplex ends are significantly under-represented in NMR and crystal structure studies, and their dynamic properties have not been measured directly. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive dynamic and structural map of DNA duplex ends. This map will be at near angstrom precision and will include all possible combinations of base pairs for the last six positions of the DNA helix (i.e. 46 = 4096 unique sequences). The approach we will use to generate the map couples NMR spectroscopy with an instrument developed in our laboratory for single molecule measurements. This instrument is based on a nanoscale pore formed by the bacterial toxin, ?-hemolysin. When individual DNA hairpins are captured in this pore by an applied electric field, the duplex stem is suspended in the pore vestibule. Preliminary results suggest that low frequency (kHz) current noise during DNA capture is caused by structural changes of the helix terminus. The aim of this R-21 proposal is to determine if the nanopore detector gives unbiased reads of DNA duplex end structure and dynamics in the Hz to MHz range. Specific questions we will address include: 1) To what extent does the pore vestibule and the applied electric field influence DNA dynamics? 2) Are the duplex end kinetics independent of hairpin loop identity and duplex stem length? 3) There is broad consensus that some sequences are unusually rigid (e.g. A tracts) while others are highly flexible (e.g. TATA). Do these sequences cause nanopore current signatures that cluster together as predicted? 4) Can pattern recognition algorithms be used to automate data analysis? We consider this research to be suited for R-21 funding because there is substantial risk that the outcome will be negative, i.e. we may find that the observed current dynamics are only relevant to the limited case of DNA hairpins captured in a nanoscale protein cavity. However, if the research is successful, it will yield a new way to observe DNA dynamics that reports precise kinetic data, and that is amenable to high throughput experiments. These nanopore experiments will be used to direct subsequent NMR experiments and vice versa.         n/a",A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends,7447802,R21GM073617,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Pattern Recognition', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Bacteriophage mu', 'Base Pairing', 'Bathing', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Caliber', 'Canada', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Couples', 'DNA', 'DNA mapping', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Enzymes', 'Exonuclease', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Hemolysin', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Pore Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teflon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Vestibule', 'base', 'detector', 'ear helix', 'electric field', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'polymerization', 'professor', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'two-dimensional']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2008,100329,-0.03428648203361106
"Structure-Based Prediction of the Interactome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) play a central role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing of genomes, complete descriptions of interactomes is a fundamental step towards a deeper understanding of biological processes, and has a vast potential to impact systems biology, genomics, molecular biology and therapeutics. Although high-throughput biochemical approaches for discovering PPIs have proven very successful, the current experimental coverage of the interactome remains inadequate and would benefit from computational tools. The broad, long term goal of this proposal is to harness the information provided by structure-based computational approaches as a potentially high-quality, high-coverage data source for large-scale integrative approaches to interactome construction. Specifically, this project aims to: 1) develop new structure-based prediction methods that can be applied on a genome scale, and 2) integrate these predictions with other functional genomic information to predict PPIs at a genome scale. This project will also generate testable hypotheses for experimental investigations. A key product of the proposed research is the LTHREADER program, a localized threading program that will simultaneously align query sequence-pairs to templates of protein-protein interfaces. By exploiting information contained in the protein complex interfaces, it may significantly improve upon the state-of-the-art in coverage and prediction quality. Some of the core computational aspects are the development of algorithms for threading query sequence-pairs to templates (using linear programming), learning statistical potentials (SVMs), and combining multiple protein interface scores for PPI prediction (boosting). The output from such structure-based approaches will be combined with other functional genomic data in the Struct2Net framework for predicting PPIs (using random forests). A final product of the proposed research will be a comprehensive database of genome-wide PPI predictions derived from purely structure-based as well as integrative approaches. The database will also include extracellular ligand-receptor interactions.       The prediction of PPIs will enable better elucidation of extracellular and intracellular signaling networks, which has direct medical implications in terms of drug target identification. For example, a promising public-health application of this research is the rational design of therapeutics which inhibit or interfere with the binding of extracellular ligands to receptors. All the produced computational algorithms, software, and databases will be made publicly available for further studies.Relevance       Proteins interact with each other to communicate within and between cells, forming networks (the Interactome) that play fundamental roles in all biomedical processes including the maintenance of cellular integrity, metabolism, transcription/translation, and cell-cell communication. Understanding these interaction networks on a large scale will empower both rational, targeted drug design and more intelligent disease management.

"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening. Antibody-based nanopore devices may also serve as highly sensitive immunosensors. n/a",Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions,7286095,K22LM008794,"['Algorithms', 'Altretamine', 'Antibodies', 'Antigenic Specificity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biophysics', 'Biosensing Techniques', 'Buffers', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Condition', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dissociation', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Fingerprint', 'Haptens', 'Hemolysin', 'Immunology', 'Informatics', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Pliability', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Semiconductors', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Study', 'Toxin', 'Variant', 'antibody engineering', 'antigen antibody binding', 'antigen binding', 'antimicrobial peptide', 'base', 'cheminformatics', 'computerized data processing', 'design', 'detector', 'expectation', 'experimental analysis', 'markov model', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanopore', 'programs', 'protein structure function', 'prototype', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'tool', 'vector', 'web interface']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),K22,2007,162000,-0.0017401316093615517

"Building motif lexicons    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  With the complete sequencing of numerous genomes and the annotation of proteomes, one of the next major challenges in biology is to understand the functions and integration of the encoded proteins (a NIH Roadmap area of emphasis). Deciphering protein function is a very time consuming, expensive process, as reflected by the disproportionately low percentage of proteins with well-established functions. One approach for extrapolating established functions to new proteins is to predict short motifs. Short motifs target proteins for post-translational modification, trafficking to cellular compartments, and binding to other proteins or molecules. Our cross-disciplinary team has built Minimotif Miner (MnM), a short motif database and platform- independent web-tool that identifies motif consensus sequences in protein queries and thus potential new protein functions (http://mnm.engr.uconn.edu/). MnM can also be used to develop new hypotheses of how specific mutations cause human disease and to identify putative targets for the development of therapeutic drugs, antibiotics, insecticides, and antiviral agents. Despite the utility of MnM and other motif resources, prediction of functional motifs still has two major limitations, which we address in this proposal. 1) To reduce the false-positive prediction of motifs, we have created a new language that allows us to consider the 3- dimensional structural conservation of motifs. For each motif, we will build specific motif definitions by combining experimental data with data from motif structures in the Protein Data Bank. We will also determine the sequence permutations that can form the observed motif structure by using molecular dynamic simulations. 2) To build a more comprehensive motif database we will use artificial intelligence to mine PubMed. The expert system will use automated literature screening, document summarization, and motif identification efficiency score to extract the majority of known motifs from PubMed. Addressing these limitations will vastly increase the utility of short motif prediction.              n/a",Building motif lexicons,7268219,R01GM079689,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adaptor Signaling Protein', 'Address', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibiotics', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biology', 'Code', 'Consensus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Expert Systems', 'Genome', 'Growth Factor', 'Human', 'Insecticides', 'Internet', 'Language', 'Letters', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mining', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nomenclature', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Performance', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Process', 'Protein Binding', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'PubMed', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Score', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'data mining', 'human disease', 'indexing', 'molecular dynamics', 'platform-independent', 'programs', 'protein function', 'protein structure', 'src Homology Region 2 Domain', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R01,2007,288025,-0.016818470732629823
"A Comprehensive catalog of human DNasel hypersensitive sites    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The overall aim of this proposal is to establish a comprehensive, high-quality catalogue of human DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) spanning all major tissue lineages. We plan to map DNaseI hypersensitive sites at physiological resolution across the genome with high sensitivity and specificity. The major focus of our production effort will be on data quality, a strategy that served the Human Genome Project well. Accordingly, samples will be rigorously screened in a pipeline fashion, with only a select set advancing to whole-genome data collection (Specific Aim 1). To ensure the broadest possible coverage of both unique and non-unique genomic territories, a synergistic combination of three technologies (DNase-array, digital mapping of DNAasel cleave site sequences, and Quantitative Chromatin Profiling) will be applied (Specific Aim 2). This combination will enable mapping of >95% of the DHSs in the genome of each cell type. Independent validation provides the ultimate quality standard. We therefore plan to validate the DHS catalogue in a statistically rigorous fashion using hypersensitivity Southerns, a well-established, gold standard assay (Specific Aim 3). Since DNAasel hypersensitive sites are generic markers of a broad spectrum of human cis-regulatory sequences, the utility of the catalogue will be greatly enhanced by the classification of DHSs into major functional categories including promoters, distal elements (enhancers, LCRs), and insulators (Specific Aim 4). Validation of DHS functional classes will be accomplished using well-tested cell and transgenic assays of biological function (Specific Aim 5).           n/a",A Comprehensive catalog of human DNasel hypersensitive sites,7410206,U54HG004592,"['Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Testing', 'Biology', 'Boundary Elements', 'Cataloging', 'Catalogs', 'Categories', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Cleaved cell', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Quality', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Deoxyribonucleases', 'Detection', 'Digestion', 'Distal', 'Distal Enhancer Elements', 'Elements', 'Employee Strikes', 'Enhancers', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Generations', 'Generic Drugs', 'Genes', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histones', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Human Genome Project', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Locales', 'Locus Control Region', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Plague', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Production', 'Public Domains', 'Range', 'Rate', 'Regulation', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Validation', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost', 'density', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'high throughput screening', 'human tissue', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'promoter']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,U54,2007,3114596,-0.014930103219313772
"A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The structure and dynamics of DNA duplex ends can influence numerous enzyme-dependent processes such as transposition of phage Mu, and integration of HIV dsDNA copies into target chromosomal DNA. Despite their critical importance in biology, DNA duplex ends are significantly under-represented in NMR and crystal structure studies, and their dynamic properties have not been measured directly. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive dynamic and structural map of DNA duplex ends. This map will be at near angstrom precision and will include all possible combinations of base pairs for the last six positions of the DNA helix (i.e. 46 = 4096 unique sequences). The approach we will use to generate the map couples NMR spectroscopy with an instrument developed in our laboratory for single molecule measurements. This instrument is based on a nanoscale pore formed by the bacterial toxin, ?-hemolysin. When individual DNA hairpins are captured in this pore by an applied electric field, the duplex stem is suspended in the pore vestibule. Preliminary results suggest that low frequency (kHz) current noise during DNA capture is caused by structural changes of the helix terminus. The aim of this R-21 proposal is to determine if the nanopore detector gives unbiased reads of DNA duplex end structure and dynamics in the Hz to MHz range. Specific questions we will address include: 1) To what extent does the pore vestibule and the applied electric field influence DNA dynamics? 2) Are the duplex end kinetics independent of hairpin loop identity and duplex stem length? 3) There is broad consensus that some sequences are unusually rigid (e.g. A tracts) while others are highly flexible (e.g. TATA). Do these sequences cause nanopore current signatures that cluster together as predicted? 4) Can pattern recognition algorithms be used to automate data analysis? We consider this research to be suited for R-21 funding because there is substantial risk that the outcome will be negative, i.e. we may find that the observed current dynamics are only relevant to the limited case of DNA hairpins captured in a nanoscale protein cavity. However, if the research is successful, it will yield a new way to observe DNA dynamics that reports precise kinetic data, and that is amenable to high throughput experiments. These nanopore experiments will be used to direct subsequent NMR experiments and vice versa.         n/a",A Comprehensive Structural and Dynamic Map of DNA Duplex Ends,7229898,R21GM073617,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Automated Pattern Recognition', 'Bacterial Toxins', 'Bacteriophage mu', 'Base Pairing', 'Bathing', 'Behavior', 'Biology', 'Caliber', 'Canada', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Couples', 'DNA', 'DNA mapping', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Devices', 'Digestion', 'Enzymes', 'Exonuclease', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Helix (Snails)', 'Hemolysin', 'Individual', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Pore Proteins', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Range', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'System', 'Teflon', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Vestibule', 'base', 'detector', 'ear helix', 'electric field', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'nanopore', 'nanoscale', 'polymerization', 'professor', 'research study', 'single molecule', 'stem', 'two-dimensional']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,R21,2007,143598,-0.03428648203361106
"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,7261326,R01GM072740,[' '],NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2007,290853,0.027038010407307324
"Support Vector Machine modeling software for improving RNAi efficacy prediction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Title Support vector machines predict sequence ~ activity relationships in RNA interference: Project Summary/Abstract: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a group of algorithms in supervised machine learning that are able to build classification or regression models on training data such that these models can be used to predict information not seen during model construction. RNA interference (RNAi) is the property of small (20 to 23 bases) RNA sequences that with the help of the RNA Induced Silencing Complex (RISC) enable the catalytic cleavage of target RNA sequences and the knockdown of the expression level of the target gene. The steps involved in loading and associating an RNAi sequences into an active RISC are several in addition to the multi-factorial variation in biochemical activities of RNAi sequences once in an active RISC. Finding the relevant biochemical features that associate with these quantifiable measures of RNAi can allow i) better predictive models of RNAi and RNAi-like (e.g. microRNAs) activities and ii) a better understanding of the relevant biochemical properties since presumably less relevant properties should not increase the predictive abilities of models containing those properties. We have developed a novel feature mapping method, referred to as Binary Base mapping, that improves the ability of a SVM to predict RNAi activities when compared to 2 previous methods, refered to as Unit Vector and N-gram mapping. Alone, the Binary Base SVM method has greater predictive accuracy than a recently published neural network machine learning method, on the same training and testing data. Several additional mapping methods can be envisioned, including methods that incorporate RNAi thermodynamics, secondary structure or measures of entropy, and whether alone or in combination these mappings of sequence to vector space for SVM model construction lead to better predictive models or understanding of RNAi biochemistry is unknown. We are requesting funding for the specific aims of: i) testing whether the Binary Base method can be used to further dissect and identify relevant biochemical feature associated with RNAi activity, ii) analyzing what additional vector mapping methods lead to predictive models with increased accuracy or greater understanding of relevant biochemical properties, and iii) investigating the distribution of sites within and among target mRNA genes where predictive SVM models identify high versus low activity. Title Support vector machines predict sequence ~ activity relationships in RNA interference: Project Narrative: Small non-coding RNAs (sncRNAs) have regulatory influence in human development and disease and better understanding how these molecules function involves the development of predictive models. Machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are 1 way to develop predictive models for these small RNA sequences and the incorporation of novel mapping methods in SVMs leads to model improvement. Finding and combining additional sequence mapping methods can lead to better predictive models for RNA interference activity as well as related processes such as microRNA activity, chemical modification of RNAi and RNAi stability or RNAi toxicity; further improving the understanding of how scnRNAs function and how they might be regulated.          n/a",Support Vector Machine modeling software for improving RNAi efficacy prediction,7157547,R43GM079132,"['RNA interference', 'biotechnology', 'computer program /software', 'computer simulation', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'gene targeting', 'genetic mapping', 'mathematical model', 'messenger RNA', 'method development', 'molecular genetics', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleic acid structure', 'thermodynamics']",NIGMS,"INTEGRATED DNA TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2006,97773,0.02321950386881817
"Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Understanding how the phenotype of an organism is produced by its genotype and environment is fundamental to modern biomedicine. Cellular biochemistry forms the best-characterized complex biochemical system available, and provides a unique opportunity to better understand the structure-function relationships that produce phenotypes. Understood mathematically, cells are a biochemical network whose topology, function, and possible behaviors are only still only dimly understood.      Our previous work has resulted in the development of several databases (END, BND, Klotho) and software systems (The Agora, Glossa) to provide, accumulate, and use data on biochemical networks by users worldwide. In this application for competitive renewal, we propose to embark on a systematic study of structure-function relationships in biochemical networks, focusing on the discovery of patterns of biochemical function --- functional motives. We will identify these motives and their distribution over all enzymatic reactions by comparing changes in reactants' structures and enzymes' specificities, rather than just examine keywords. This systematic examination will allow us to determine, at much greater resolution than ever before, what functions each molecule and reaction have. To do this we must significantly extend the functionalities of our current systems in three major ways. First, we will add significant new data on the structure of small molecules of biochemical interest, enzymatic reactions, the mechanisms of gene expression, and dementia. Second, we will further develop and test methods that produce semantic interoperability among independent, disparate databases. Third, we will develop algorithms to detect and catalogue patterns of biochemical function among thousands of reactions and molecules; to more speedily enumerate paths among molecules and subnets in the biochemical network; to determine the extent of convergent evolution among enzymes; to trace atoms through a sequence of reactions such as a metabolic pathway; and to suggest novel biochemical reactions. We will use these capabilities to define and search for functional motives among enzymatic reactions, testing their correlation with network topology and dynamics, and to estimate the extent to which functional similarities arise from convergent evolution of enzymes. n/a",Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases,7107923,R01GM056529,"['artificial intelligence', 'biochemistry', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'dementia', 'enzyme mechanism', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular dynamics', 'physiology', 'protein structure function']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2006,509027,0.016214810437998443

"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening.

"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques.

"Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   To date, post-genomic analysis has focused on identification and annotation of protein-coding genes and their products. In comparison, the identification of DNA sequences encoding functional RNA has been largely neglected. Functional RNAs can encode trans-acting molecules that interact with other RNAs or proteins, such as tRNAs, rRNAs, RNaseP RNA, small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs; they can also function in cis as untranslated regions that regulate post-transcriptional expression of mRNAs. Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that there may be hundreds of unknown functional RNAs in prokaryotes and thousands in eukaryotes.      The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a computational approach to the identification of novel RNA genes and functional RNA elements in complete DNA genomes. Machine learning techniques will be used to recognize hallmarks of functional RNA coding sequences by comparison with sequences that do not encode RNAs. Several types of signals are useful in discriminating functional RNA including: 1) differences in global sequence composition, 2) calculated RNA secondary structure features, i.e. free energy of folding and 3) specific sequence elements common to RNA structure. These and other parameters can be rapidly tried and tested using machine learning methods. This method will be optimized for individual genomes with respect to input databases, parameterization and machine learning method and architecture. Results will be evaluated computationally by cross-validation testing, comparative genomics, and calculated secondary structure and free energy of folding. Experimental studies of RNA expression and function will be conducted in conjunction with collaborators.      Preliminary studies have demonstrated the power of this approach to predict novel functional RNAs in E. coli, other bacteria and archaea as supported by computational cross-validation and experimental confirmation. We will test and apply this approach to discover new functional RNAs in eukaryotic genomes including S. cervisiae, C. elegans, and humans. RNA prediction for these larger and more complex genomes will require the optimization of computational parameters, as well as the development of appropriate input datasets and training algorithms.      The prediction of novel functional RNAs in the human genome presents an opportunity to understand new regulatory and developmental processes. Known RNAs implicated in human disease, such as telomerase RNA (cancer, aging), XIST RNA (X-chromosome inactivation) and BIC (a proto-oncogene) underscore the importance of developing a method to identify the full complement of human RNA genes.         n/a",Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences,6891680,R01HG002665,"['Archaea', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Escherichia coli', 'RNA', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'animal genetic material tag', 'artificial intelligence', 'biotechnology', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'eukaryote', 'functional /structural genomics', 'genetic library', 'genetic mapping', 'human genetic material tag', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid quantitation /detection', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleic acid structure', 'prokaryote', 'technology /technique development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2005,377162,0.07008156465911758

Our previous work has resulted in the development of several databases (END, BND, Klotho) and software systems (The Agora, Glossa) to provide, accumulate, and use data on biochemical networks by users worldwide. In this application for competitive renewal, we propose to embark on a systematic study of structure-function relationships in biochemical networks, focusing on the discovery of patterns of biochemical function --- functional motives. We will identify these motives and their distribution over all enzymatic reactions by comparing changes in reactants' structures and enzymes' specificities, rather than just examine keywords. This systematic examination will allow us to determine, at much greater resolution than ever before, what functions each molecule and reaction have. To do this we must significantly extend the functionalities of our current systems in three major ways. First, we will add significant new data on the structure of small molecules of biochemical interest, enzymatic reactions, the mechanisms of gene expression, and dementia. Second, we will further develop and test methods that produce semantic interoperability among independent, disparate databases. Third, we will develop algorithms to detect and catalogue patterns of biochemical function among thousands of reactions and molecules; to more speedily enumerate paths among molecules and subnets in the biochemical network; to determine the extent of convergent evolution among enzymes; to trace atoms through a sequence of reactions such as a metabolic pathway; and to suggest novel biochemical reactions. We will use these capabilities to define and search for functional motives among enzymatic reactions, testing their correlation with network topology and dynamics, and to estimate the extent to which functional similarities arise from convergent evolution of enzymes. n/a",Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases,6944266,R01GM056529,"['artificial intelligence', 'biochemistry', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'dementia', 'enzyme mechanism', 'functional /structural genomics', 'information system analysis', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular dynamics', 'physiology', 'protein structure function']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2005,523667,0.016214810437998443
"The MEME suite of motif-based sequence analysis tools DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A wide variety of biological processes and signals are mediated by patterns detectable at the sequence level in proteins, DNA and RNA. For example, one facet of transcriptional regulation of genes involves proteins (transcription factors) recognizing and binding to specific DNA sequence patterns. Other examples of important biological sequence patterns include protein structural domains, microRNAs and the protein target sequences of kinases. The MEME suite of bioinformatics software tools provide biologists with powerful methods for discovering, analyzing and interpreting biological sequence patterns of many types, including those mentioned above. The suite includes one tool - MEME -- that biologists use to discover novel sequence patterns (motifs), and three tools -- Meta-MEME, MCAST and MAST -- that biologists use to search sequence databases for matches to motif-based sequence models. This grant will enable us to dramatically improve the scientific value of the suite to the thousands of biologists who already use it. These improvements will be visible to the biologist using the suite as increased availability, better support, better user-interface and documentation, more powerful algorithms, better interoperability, and faster release cycles. We will achieve these goals via a combination of three specific aims: (1) improved software engineering, (2) ongoing support and (3) continued software development of the suite. n/a",The MEME suite of motif-based sequence analysis tools,6907504,R01RR021692,"['artificial intelligence', 'bioinformatics', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'computer human interaction', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'computer system hardware', 'mathematical model', 'microRNAs', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'protein structure', 'transcription factor']",NCRR,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2005,307663,-0.02587021065835124
"BioHDF - Open Binary File Standards for Bioinformatics DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Geospiza Inc. and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) are creating a standards based software framework around NCSA's Heirarchical Data Format (HDF5). The envisioned framework will integrate algorithms important in DNA and protein sequence analysis to create scalable high throughput software systems which will be accessed using new graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to provide researchers with new views of their data to finish sequencing projects in large-scale genome sequencing, microbial genome sequencing, viral epidemiology, polymorphism detection, phylogenetic analysis, multi-locus sequence typing, confirmatory sequencing, and EST analysis.    In our vision, algorithms will be either integrated into the system to directly read and write from HDF5 project files, or they will communicate with project files via filter programs that produce standardized XML formatted data. Through this model, a scalable solution will support different applications of DNA sequencing, fulfilling the many needs and requirements expressed by the medical research community now and into the future. As the first step in this process we will, define requirements for editing and versioning data in DNA sequencing, research and propose data models for the computational phases of DNA sequencing and annotating DNA sequence data using existing standards, create a prototype application for DNA sequencing based SNP discovery, and engage the bioinformatics community for BioHDF adoption.       In the past ten years the cost of sequencing DNA has dropped over 1000 fold and the amount of raw sequence data, entering our national repositories is doubling every 12 months. DNA sequencing is fundamental to biological research activities such as genomics, systems biology, and clinical medicine. Proposals are being sought to decrease sequencing costs by two orders of magnitude through technology refinements with an ultimate vision of developing technology to sequence human genome equivalents for $1000 each. The amount of data that will be produced through these endeavors is unimaginable. However, the $1,000 genome will not advance medical research unless we integrate all phases of the DNA sequencing process and treat the creation, management, finishing, analysis, and sharing of the data as common goals. n/a",BioHDF - Open Binary File Standards for Bioinformatics,6992995,R41HG003792,"['DNA', 'artificial intelligence', 'bioengineering /biomedical engineering', 'bioinformatics', 'computational biology', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'functional /structural genomics', 'genetic mapping', 'genetic polymorphism', 'mathematics', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'single nucleotide polymorphism', 'virus genetics']",NHGRI,"GEOSPIZA, INC.",R41,2005,142775,0.003576748620195992
"Knowledge-based Analysis of Transcription Factor Binding I propose new knowledge-based approaches for determining both the short sequences of DNA to which transcription factors bind and the ways in which the context of these sequences specify regulatory control. I will apply these approaches to recently produced binding data from chromatin-immunoprecipitation microarray efforts in S. cerevisiae. First, I will incorporate information from three-dimensional structures of protein-DNA complexes into motif discovery algorithms to identify over-represented sequences in the bound intergenic regions. Second, I will use machine learning techniques to apply multiple criteria based on biological knowledge of promoter organization to identify which of the binding sites predicted by these algorithms are genuine. As a first application of new motifs found using these approaches, I will perform hypothesis-directed sequence analysis to reconcile differences between in vivo binding and the organization of binding sites in promoters.

"Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions DESCRIPTION:    Nanopore-based single-molecule detection has recently become established as a new tool in single molecule biophysics. Evidence is presented that single antibodies can be observed with a nanopore detector, which presents a wide range of possibilities for immunological research. The hypothesis to be tested is that nanopore-based detection can be used to study single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction and analyze conformational changes that occur in antibody upon binding to antigen. This application aims to develop the utility of the nanopore-based approach through improvements in both the detection device and the software used to extract information from the channel current signal. At the same time, these studies will allow the Candidate to gain expertise in immunology and the biophysical study of protein structure and function. To study the single molecule dynamics of antibody-antigen interaction, the following three specific aims are proposed:   1. Extend nanopore based detection to nanopore/antibody based detection.   2. Implement machine learning software for automated nanopore/antibody signal analysis and experimental feedback.   3. Use well-characterized, genetically engineered, antibodies to test the utility of the nanopore device to analyze motion in the antibody molecule.   These studies will expand the utility of nanopore devices to study single molecule protein interactions.   Information gained will lead to a better understanding of the molecular dynamics associated with antigen binding by antibody and the subsequent initiation of effector functions. Since most biological nanopore variants derive from pore-forming toxins, nanopore device enhancements eventually may lead to new methods for antibody and antimicrobial-peptide immunological screening. Antibody-based nanopore devices may also serve as highly sensitive immunosensors. n/a",Nanopore study of single antibody-antigen interactions,6959048,K22LM008794,"['antigen antibody reaction', 'bioinformatics', 'biomedical automation', 'computer program /software', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'intermolecular interaction', 'molecular dynamics', 'nanotechnology', 'pore forming protein', 'protein quantitation /detection']",NLM,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL (NEW ORLEANS),K22,2005,162000,-0.0017401316093615517
"Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures DESCRIPTION:    High-throughput data collection methods have revolutionized many areas of biology and medicine. The National Library of Medicine has targeted the representation, management, and manipulation of biological structure as a key element of its mission. Following upon the success of genome sequencing and functional genomics projects, the structural biology community is creating technologies to streamline the process of determining three-dimensional biological structures--with efforts in structural genomics. Like other high-throughput efforts, a major challenge for these efforts is the appropriate annotation and indexing of structures for retrieval and analysis by biologists who are trying to understand molecular function at an atomic detail: Where are the important functional sites, and how confident are we in their location?      In this proposal, we plan to develop and apply methods for annotating biological structures, so that active sites, binding sites and interaction sites in biological structures can be automatically identified and annotated. Our novel computational representation of functional sites has been successful in characterizing these sites, and recognizing them based on their biochemical and biophysical signature--a 3D motif. We propose to improve the performance of our method with basic research in the representations and algorithms used for our site models. Because our site models are manually created, our library of available models has grown slowly. We therefore further propose to accelerate the growth of our model library using a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. First, we will use known 1D sequence motifs as ""seeds"" to create corresponding 3D motifs. Second, we will develop techniques for discovering entirely new motifs using cluster techniques. We will evaluate our models and resulting predictions through analysis of known structural sites, follow-up and dissemination of predictions with the structural genomics community, and large-scale evaluation on decoy and predicted structures. We will make the resulting models available on the Web for real-time structural annotation, and will distribute the software for open source development. n/a",Annotating functional sites in 3D biological structures,6942980,R01LM005652,"['active sites', 'binding sites', 'computer simulation', 'macromolecule', 'model design /development', 'physical model', 'structural biology']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,324673,0.033432139337402356
"Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The splicing together of exons during the transcription of most eukaryotic pre-mRNA molecules is a fundamental step in the transfer of information from DNA to protein. However, how the splice sites are recognized to initiate this fast and accurate process in not at all clear, since false sequences that resemble real sites outnumber the latter by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude yet are not used. We are searching for the additional information that specifies splice site recognition during pre-mRNA splicing in mammalian cells. In previous work we have used computational analysis to discover that: 1) that exon flanks 50 nt beyond the splice site consensuses can greatly influence splicing and contain sequences that stand out from the background; and 2) there are a large number of specific 8 mers that can act either as exonic splicing enhancers or splicing silencers. We will characterize both of these types of sequences, defining their base requirements, extent, position dependence, and specificity. With regard to the last, we will develop a novel exhaustive survey method that uses massively parallel solid state sequencing to identify every possible 8-mer that can be functional in a particular context, and we will compare this profile in different intronic, exonic and cellular contexts for constitutive and alternatively spliced exons. The flanking sequences fall into 2 distinct classes according to their G+C contents; we will test the idea that the rules governing exon definition differ for the two classes. To simplify the discovery of rules that govern exon definition, we will create designer exons made up of synthetic 8-mer modules we have identified as enhancers, silencers or neutral sequences. The numbers and spacing of these modules will reveal relationships that are hidden in the complexity of natural sequences. Finally, we will continue to use computation, including new machine learning algorithms, to better define intronic elements and to discover interactions between two or more features of a local sequence that define a splice site. We will also develop a Web-based exon-finding program that integrates all the information we have accumulated. Pre-mRNA splicing goes awry in a large proportion or human genetic disease cases. An understanding of the rules that govern the recognition of splice sites should help in the design of therapeutic intervention strategies to reverse such ill effects.                           n/a",Exon recognition during constitutive pre-mRNA splicing,6966860,R01GM072740,"['Internet', 'RNA splicing', 'binding sites', 'computational biology', 'computer system design /evaluation', 'genetic regulation', 'messenger RNA', 'molecular biology information system', 'molecular shape', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'serial analysis of gene expression', 'statistics /biometry']",NIGMS,COLUMBIA UNIV NEW YORK MORNINGSIDE,R01,2005,304845,0.027038010407307324
"Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   To date, post-genomic analysis has focused on identification and annotation of protein-coding genes and their products. In comparison, the identification of DNA sequences encoding functional RNA has been largely neglected. Functional RNAs can encode trans-acting molecules that interact with other RNAs or proteins, such as tRNAs, rRNAs, RNaseP RNA, small nucleolar RNAs and microRNAs; they can also function in cis as untranslated regions that regulate post-transcriptional expression of mRNAs. Recent experimental and computational studies suggest that there may be hundreds of unknown functional RNAs in prokaryotes and thousands in eukaryotes.      The primary goal of this proposal is to develop a computational approach to the identification of novel RNA genes and functional RNA elements in complete DNA genomes. Machine learning techniques will be used to recognize hallmarks of functional RNA coding sequences by comparison with sequences that do not encode RNAs. Several types of signals are useful in discriminating functional RNA including: 1) differences in global sequence composition, 2) calculated RNA secondary structure features, i.e. free energy of folding and 3) specific sequence elements common to RNA structure. These and other parameters can be rapidly tried and tested using machine learning methods. This method will be optimized for individual genomes with respect to input databases, parameterization and machine learning method and architecture. Results will be evaluated computationally by cross-validation testing, comparative genomics, and calculated secondary structure and free energy of folding. Experimental studies of RNA expression and function will be conducted in conjunction with collaborators.      Preliminary studies have demonstrated the power of this approach to predict novel functional RNAs in E. coli, other bacteria and archaea as supported by computational cross-validation and experimental confirmation. We will test and apply this approach to discover new functional RNAs in eukaryotic genomes including S. cervisiae, C. elegans, and humans. RNA prediction for these larger and more complex genomes will require the optimization of computational parameters, as well as the development of appropriate input datasets and training algorithms.      The prediction of novel functional RNAs in the human genome presents an opportunity to understand new regulatory and developmental processes. Known RNAs implicated in human disease, such as telomerase RNA (cancer, aging), XIST RNA (X-chromosome inactivation) and BIC (a proto-oncogene) underscore the importance of developing a method to identify the full complement of human RNA genes.         n/a",Discovery of Novel RNA Genes in Genomic DNA Sequences,6751643,R01HG002665,"['Archaea', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Escherichia coli', 'RNA', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'animal genetic material tag', 'artificial intelligence', 'biotechnology', 'computer assisted sequence analysis', 'eukaryote', 'functional /structural genomics', 'genetic library', 'genetic mapping', 'human genetic material tag', 'mathematical model', 'molecular biology information system', 'nucleic acid quantitation /detection', 'nucleic acid sequence', 'nucleic acid structure', 'prokaryote', 'technology /technique development']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIF-LAWRENC BERKELEY LAB,R01,2004,377162,0.07008156465911758

"Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The ability to delineate (at least in theory) all the proteins encoded in the human genome and all of those encoded by the genomes of major human parasites has given us an unprecedented opportunity to address the causes and treatment of every major human disease.  However, the vast increase in biological knowledge that has resulted from the last decade of genomic DNA sequencing has led us to a a crisis in bioinformatics.  This crisis is two-fold: analysis of data and planning of experiments.  Most of the scientific resources being expended in bioinformatics are being spent on data analysis tools. While these are essential, we should not neglect the opportunity to accelerate the progress of actual experimental biology.  All modern experimental molecular biology (and, increasingly, structural biology) depends upon the availability of plasmid clones to address specific scientific questions.  Although software facilitating DNA manipulations exists, few programs advise users of optimal strategies and none automate the process of clone generation. Genomics initiatives identify proteins at the genome level and demand the generation of hundreds of expression clones for recombinant protein production in exogenous hosts such as E. coli.  Establishment of libraries of expression clones requires automation and optimization as well as effective means of data storage, archiving, annotation and query.  To address these needs, as well as to facilitate routine DNA manipulations in virtually any molecular biology laboratory, we propose (1) to test and build a task centered virtual cloning expert system that serves as a knowledge base for DNA manipulations, and (2) to test and build an information automaton for the construction of expression clone libraries in support of structural genomics initiatives and other high throughput experiments.         n/a",Development of Bioinformatic Tools for Virtual Cloning,6583437,R43GM067279,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' computer program /software', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' expression cloning', ' gene expression', ' genetic library', ' genetic manipulation', ' informatics', ' molecular biology information system', ' transfection /expression vector']",NIGMS,"VIRMATICS, LLC",R43,2003,100000,-0.019638030618728555
"Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Understanding how the phenotype of an organism is produced by its genotype and environment is fundamental to modern biomedicine. Cellular biochemistry forms the best-characterized complex biochemical system available, and provides a unique opportunity to better understand the structure-function relationships that produce phenotypes. Understood mathematically, cells are a biochemical network whose topology, function, and possible behaviors are only still only dimly understood.      Our previous work has resulted in the development of several databases (END, BND, Klotho) and software systems (The Agora, Glossa) to provide, accumulate, and use data on biochemical networks by users worldwide. In this application for competitive renewal, we propose to embark on a systematic study of structure-function relationships in biochemical networks, focusing on the discovery of patterns of biochemical function --- functional motives. We will identify these motives and their distribution over all enzymatic reactions by comparing changes in reactants' structures and enzymes' specificities, rather than just examine keywords. This systematic examination will allow us to determine, at much greater resolution than ever before, what functions each molecule and reaction have. To do this we must significantly extend the functionalities of our current systems in three major ways. First, we will add significant new data on the structure of small molecules of biochemical interest, enzymatic reactions, the mechanisms of gene expression, and dementia. Second, we will further develop and test methods that produce semantic interoperability among independent, disparate databases. Third, we will develop algorithms to detect and catalogue patterns of biochemical function among thousands of reactions and molecules; to more speedily enumerate paths among molecules and subnets in the biochemical network; to determine the extent of convergent evolution among enzymes; to trace atoms through a sequence of reactions such as a metabolic pathway; and to suggest novel biochemical reactions. We will use these capabilities to define and search for functional motives among enzymatic reactions, testing their correlation with network topology and dynamics, and to estimate the extent to which functional similarities arise from convergent evolution of enzymes. n/a",Community Deposit and Review of Biochemical Databases,6694513,R01GM056529,"['artificial intelligence', ' biochemistry', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' dementia', ' enzyme mechanism', ' functional /structural genomics', ' information system analysis', ' mathematical model', ' molecular biology information system', ' molecular dynamics', ' physiology', ' protein structure function']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2003,556670,0.016214810437998443

"Second Generation DNA Sequence Management Tools   DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human genome project spurred the            development of high throughput technologies, especially in the area of DNA           sequencing. Not only has this effort produced a draft of the human genome, it's      catalyzed development of an entire industry based on DNA sequencing and              genomics. Since these technologies produce enormous amounts of data they depend      on bioinformatics programs for data management. Phrap, Cross_Match,                  RepeatMasker and Consed are four programs that played an integral role in the        human genome project and became accepted as standard. However, as the                technology for sequencing has evolved, so too, have the applications. These new      applications include sequencing additional genomes, EST cluster analysis, and        genotyping and they have highlighted the need to update standard bioinformatics      programs to meet the current needs of a broader community. In this project we        will re-engineer Phrap, Cross_Match and Repeat Masker to improve performance by      optimizing these algorithms and developing a hierarchical data file to store         and manipulate assembled sequence data. Phrap and Cross_Match will also be           modified to use XML-formatted data allowing users to apply constraints to            sequence assembly.

"Genomic application of suspension array technology DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The principle of the proposed project is the application of fluorescent microsphere based suspension array technology (SAT) to the cytometry based simultaneous detection of multi analytes. The proposal consists of four overlapping subprojects: (a) Technological development of biological microbead procedures using cells or microorganisms as substitutes for polymeric microspheres to lower the cost of SAT compared to the cost of methods using microbeads manufactured by polymer chemistry. (b) Development of a test to detect gene translocations and rearragements frequently responsible for malignant transformations. A method based on measuring bead-based hybridization of specific 5' and 3' nucleotide sequences in the vicinity of chromosomal translocation breakpoints would allow large scale screening of leukemias and various types of cancers by the measurement of 5'/3' sequence ratio. (c) Development of a DNA binding protein profiling assay providing easy, reproducible and high throughput technology to determine the expression pattern of transcription factors (TFs) binding to single stranded hexamere oligonucleotide sequences anchored to the solid phase surface of microspheres. This subproject is at the R&D level and needs to be thoroughly tested.

"PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY Computer algorithms based on pattern recognition are being used in many areas of science and technology to assist the scientist in solving complex, time-consuming, and often tedious real-world problems.  The basic premise is to train a computer to efficiently identify a known pattern in an unknown dataset.  This needle-in-a-haystack approach is being used in the area of genomics, where there are already several examples of very powerful computational pattern recognition approaches available for searching new sequences for structural motifs, similarities to other proteins and DNA, and predicting secondary structure, based solely on the DNA or amino acid sequence.  We believe that macromolecular crystallography can also benefit from the application of pattern recognition to the often daunting task of fitting atoms into an electron density map.  The fact that electron density maps are three-dimensional images provides an additional challenge to this technology in that the procedures we are developing in order to find matching patterns must be rotation invariant.  To test the validity of our hypothesis we will complete the following aims: 1) we will develop a set of rotation invariant features that can characterize the patterns in regions of an electron density map, 2) we will determine the optimal size of feature regions and the size and type of structural database required to find similar regions of electron density capable of accurately determining structures, and 3) we will develop a methodology to synthesize matched regions to produce coherent local and global models of protein structure. If these goals can be met, we will investigate the feasibility of incorporating knowledge-based methods, neural networks, and other AI techniques to augment the interpretation of structures from electron density maps.  In addition, we will attempt to extend this methodology to produce initial structures for electron density maps that are either of poor quality and/or low resolution.  n/a",PATTERN RECOGNITION IN MACROMOLECULAR CRYSTALLOGRAPHY,6182183,R21GM059398,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' electron crystallography', ' electron density', ' molecular biology information system', ' physical model', ' protein structure', ' structural biology']",NIGMS,TEXAS ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT STATION,R21,2000,101500,-0.026424904334007997

Thus, in addition to virologists, target users include electron microscopists and structural biologists. The result of this Phase Il SBIR will be a completely integrated and tested software package allowing easy, efficient, and routine virus structure determination. PROPOSED COMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS: Tumbleweed is targeted at a large group of users with varied knowledge, experience, and research goals. Virologists will be attracted to the extensive user guidance and intuitive design. Structural biologists and electron microscopists performing virus structure determination will be attracted to the concept of a complete integrated software package. Last, all electron microscopists and structural biologists will be attracted to the integration of all general data processing into a single extendible package. Combined this group should provide a large user-base allowing QED Labs to commercialize Tumbleweed successfully.  n/a",VIRUS STRUCTURE DETERMINATION SOFTWARE,6071498,R44GM058327,"['artificial intelligence', ' computer data analysis', ' computer human interaction', ' computer program /software', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' data management', ' electron microscopy', ' molecular dynamics', ' structural biology', ' virus assembly', ' virus morphology']",NIGMS,QED LABS,R44,2000,364001,0.0005931659134156181
"STATISTICAL STUDIES OF DNA EVOLUTION Our goals are to develop methods for statistical analyses of DNA sequence data and to understand the mechanisms of DNA evolution. The specific aims are: l. To examine current methods and develop new methods for estimating evolutionary dates, which is now a central issue in molecular evolution. We shall use the new methods to study divergence dates in mammals, which have recently become very controversial. 2. To develop methods for estimating selection intensities in different regions of a gene and to carry out statistical analyses of DNA sequence data from mammals. 3. To develop fast algorithms for finding optimal trees for the following methods: maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony, and minimum evolution. Such algorithms are much needed because these methods require a tremendous amount of computer time-and are not feasible for large trees. 4. An expert system for choosing the best tree reconstruction method for a data set according to the attributes of the data. 5.

"GENE PREDICTION--MARKOV MODELS AND COMPLEMENTARY METHODS   DESCRIPTION (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract): The goal of the project                                               is to build more accurate and powerful DNA sequence interpretation algorithms        utilizing the positive experience and ideas of previously proven GeneMark and        GenMark.hmm methods.                                                                                                                                                      We plan to improve the quality of gene finding in prokaryotic genomes in terms       of reliable and accurate prediction of gene starts and detection of frameshift                                                   sequencing errors. We also plan to develop a machine-learning iterative              procedure for deriving all necessary models for precise gene                         prediction/annotation from totally anonymous prokaryotic sequences.                                                                                                       For eukaryotic species, we will improve the accuracy of the ab initio method         GeneMark.hmm by building more accurate models for splice sites and                   initiation/termination sites, and we will address the problem of accurately          finding intergenic regions with polyadenilation sites and promoters.

"COMPUTER BASED SEQUENCE ANALYSIS AND RNA VIRUS EVOLUTION The goal of the proposed research is the analysis of biological sequence         data to address the molecular mechanisms of evolution and the origin(s)          of all viruses and related genetic elements. Phylogenetic trees will             provide a framework for the mapping of cell and tissue tropism,                  pathogenicity and virulence, modes of transmission and geographical              distributions, and many other higher order characteristics of viruses.           The specific aims of proposed analytical studies are: 1) determining             functionally equivalent networks and frequency of exchange among and             between retroid elements, and their potential cellular homologues,               including new studies on 300 retroviral env proteins; 2) inferring               functionally important regions of all proteins of paramyxo-, rhabdo- and         filoviruses, (with privileged access to new Ebola sequences), and Borna          Disease virus, (including potential BDV sequences from schizophrenic             patients); and 3) the analysis of the dUTPase gene, as a model system,           to address issues relevant to the structure, function and evolution of           duplicated sequences, and potential horizontal transfer among and between        host and viral genomes. The specific aims of the technical studies are:          1) evaluation of stochastic production model approaches for generation           of multiple alignments, detection of recombination, and calculation of           evolutionary distances; and 2) development and testing of new and                existing methods for historical reconstruction of functionally equivalent        networks.                                                                                                                                                         RNA viruses (e.g. HIV, or Ebola) are the major causative agents of human,        animal and plant viral diseases world wide. The heterogeneous nature of          RNA populations makes it difficult to develop effective, anti-viral              agents. The sequence database is now large enough to conduct comparative         studies on natural variants versus chemotheraputically induced mutants           for several retroviral proteins. This model study will provide new               information on the nature of selected mutations which will be useful in          future anti-viral drug development.                                                                                                                               Computational analysis of primary sequence data is an area of intense            interest in biology, mathematics, statistics and systems science. In the         last few years new approaches to problem solving and classification, such        as machine learning, neural networks, genetic algorithms, and stochastic         production models or, ""intelligent systems"" as they are referred to              collectively, have become available. Unfortunately most biologists are           unaware of these developments. Application of these methods to real data         remains unexplored. The proposed studies will go a long way in rectifying        this gap in technological utilization. These studies will continue to            define important evolutionary relationships and events, provide                  biologically informative sequence relationships for bench-marking new            software, and contribute new information relevant to the structure and           function of viral proteins suggesting new directions in laboratory               experimentation.

"Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation Summary/Abstract Alignment of biological sequences is a key step in understanding their evolution, function, and patterns of activity. Here, we describe Machine Learning approaches to improve both accuracy and speed of highly- sensitive sequence alignment. To improve accuracy, we develop methods to reduce erroneous annotation caused by (1) the existence of low complexity and repetitive sequence and (2) the overextension of alignments of true homologs into unrelated sequence. We describe approaches based on both hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks to dramatically reduce these sorts of sequence annotation error. We also address the issue of annotation speed, with development of a custom Deep Learning architecture designed to very quickly filter away large portions of candidate sequence comparisons prior to the relatively-slow sequence-alignment step. The results of these efforts will be incorporated into forks of the open source sequence alignment tools HMMER, MMSeqs, and (where appropriate) BLAST; we will also work with community developers of annotation pipelines, such as RepeatMasker and IMG/M, to incorporate these approaches. The development and incorporation into these widely used bioinformatics tools will lead to widespread impact on sequence annotation efforts. Narrative Modern molecular biology depends on effective methods for creating sequence alignments quickly and accurately. This proposal describes a plan to develop novel Machine Learning approaches that will dramatically increase the speed of highly-sensitive sequence alignment, and will also address two significant sources of erroneous sequence annotation, (i) the presence of repetitive sequence in biological sequences, and (ii) the tendency for sequence alignment algorithms to extend alignments beyond the boundaries of true homology. The proposed methods represent a mix of applications of hidden Markov models and Artificial Neural Networks, and build on prior success in applying such methods to the problem of sensitive sequence annotation.",Machine learning approaches for improved accuracy and speed in sequence annotation,10020995,R01GM132600,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Classification', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Consumption', 'Custom', 'DNA Transposable Elements', 'Data Set', 'Deletion Mutation', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Error Sources', 'Evolution', 'Foundations', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Industry Standard', 'Insertion Mutation', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Letters', 'Licensing', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular Biology', 'Network-based', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Pilot Projects', 'Proteins', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Analysis', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Statistical Models', 'Takifugu', 'Work', 'annotation  system', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'computing resources', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'markov model', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'software development', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA,R01,2020,287504,0.006907651693899272
"DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics Project Summary/Abstract  DNA synthesis has played a key role in the biotechnology revolution. The ready availability of synthetic DNA oligonucleotides and of genes assembled from them, has been invaluable for elucidating and unlocking biological function and enabling the new field of synthetic biology which can create novel cells, enzymes, therapeutics, diagnostics and other reagents of commercial value. Despite this impact, DNA synthesis uses chemical strategies developed over 30 years ago which are costly and limited to molecules of 200 nucleotides or less in length.  Next-generation enzymatic DNA synthesis technologies are being explored that use template- independent DNA polymerases (TIDPs) for controlled addition of nucleotides to a growing DNA strand. Although advances have been reported recently, enzymatic DNA synthesis is still limited by the low efficiency of available TIDPs, and specifically by the relative inability of these polymerases to incorporate 3'-blocked nucleotides.  In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project, Primordial Genetics Inc, a synthetic biology company with differentiated combinatorial genetic technology, and Denovium Inc., an artificial intelligence company pioneering novel Al methods for genetic discovery, are joining forces to develop novel and highly efficient TIDPs for enzymatic DNA synthesis in vitro.  Denovium will use their computational capabilities based on machine learning algorithms to discover novel TIDPs with the desired activities from proprietary and public databases. Denovium will also perform proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) scans to determine the functional impact of all possible mutations on the selected TIDPs. Primordial Genetics will synthesize and express the resulting collection of sequences, and test them in vitro to identify the most active enzymes. The best 2 enzymes will be diversified using Primordial Genetics' proprietary Function Generator technology and other randomized diversification methods. Populations of genes encoding enzyme variants will be screened with ultra-high-throughput screens to identify the most active enzymes. The dataset resulting from this work will be used to train Denovium's sequence prediction algorithm to accelerate further enzyme improvements in Phase II.  The proposed work is a feasibility study for isolating and developing novel enzymes suitable for enzymatic DNA synthesis, and also for creating a pipeline of enzyme optimization tools. The enzymes discovered and in this work will be directly useful for enzymatic DNA synthesis applications, and can be licensed or sold to leading DNA and gene manufaturers. Project Narrative The principal aim of this project is to develop novel and improved DNA polymerases for the industrial synthesis of DNA, which is currently performed by synthetic chemical methods and represents one of the cornerstone technologies of the biotechnology industry. To overcome limitations of the current chemical technology in cost, efficiency and the length of DNA molecules that can be synthesized, there have been widespread attempts to develop specific DNA polymerases as efficient molecular machines for synthesizing DNA. This project will develop novel and more efficient polymerases than are currently available, which will impact the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of human diseases such as cancer, heart disease, HIV and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis.",DNA 3.0: Developing novel enzymes for DNA synthesis with deep learning and combinatorial genetics,10010243,R43HG010995,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biotechnology', 'Capital', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Collection', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cost efficiency', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'DNA', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Enzymes', 'Equipment', 'Evolution', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'HIV', 'Heart Diseases', 'In Vitro', 'Industrialization', 'Industry', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Licensing', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Microbe', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Machines', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Polymerase', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Randomized', 'Reagent', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Single-Stranded DNA', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'genetic technology', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in vitro testing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'model development', 'next generation', 'novel', 'phosphoramidite', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive test', 'research and development', 'synthetic biology', 'synthetic construct', 'tool']",NHGRI,"PRIMORDIAL GENETICS, INC",R43,2020,374524,-0.07619520336895795
"Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors Project Summary Scientific understanding of adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) has the potential to revolutionize prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of disease. High‐throughput DNA sequencing and functional experiments have now brought the study of adaptive immune receptors into the big‐data era. To realize this potential of these data they must be matched with appropriately powerful analytical techniques. Existing probabilistic and mechanistic models are insufficient to capture the complexities of these data, while a naïve application of machine learning cannot leverage our profound existing knowledge of the immune system. The goal of this project is to blend deep learning with mechanistic modeling in order to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors. Aim 1: Develop generative models of immune receptor sequences that capture the complexity of real adaptive immune receptor repertoires. These will combine deep learning along with our knowledge of VDJ recombination, and provide a rigorous platform for detailed repertoire comparison. Aim 2: Develop quantitative mechanistic models of antibody somatic hypermutation that incorporate the underlying biochemical processes. Estimate intractable likelihoods using deep learning to infer important latent variables, and validate models using knock‐out experiments in cell lines. Aim 3: Develop hybrid deep learning models to predict binding properties from sequence data, combining large experimentally‐derived binding data with even larger sets of immune sequences from human immune memory samples. Incorporate structural information via 3D convolution or distance‐based penalties. These tools will reveal the full power of immune repertoire data for medical applications. We will obtain more rigorous comparisons of repertoires via their distribution in a relevant space. These will reveal the effects of immune perturbations such as vaccination and disease, allowing us to pick out sequences that are impacted by these perturbations. We will have a greater quantitative understanding of somatic hypermutation in vivo, and statistical models that appropriately capture long‐range effects of collections of mutations. We will also have algorithms that will be able to combine repertoire data and sparse binding data to predict binding properties. Put together, these advances will enable rational vaccine design, treatment for autoimmune disease, and identification of T cells that are promising candidates for cancer immunotherapy. Project Narrative Adaptive immune receptors (i.e. antibodies and T cell receptors) enable our body to fight off disease, “remember” pathogens, and train the immune system through vaccination. Immunologists have learned via high‐throughput sequencing that adaptive immune receptors have a truly remarkable diversity. In this proposal, we develop machine‐learning methods for these sequence data, which will allow us to predict the maturation, statistical distribution, and binding properties of adaptive immune receptors, and thus to better design vaccinations, autoimmune disease treatment, and immunotherapy treatment for cancer.",Blending deep learning with probabilistic mechanistic models to predict and understand the evolution and function of adaptive immune receptors,9938424,R01AI146028,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Process', 'Categories', 'Cell Line', 'Characteristics', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Entropy', 'Evolution', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Gene Conversion', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'High-Throughput DNA Sequencing', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunoglobulin Somatic Hypermutation', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunological Models', 'Immunologics', 'Immunologist', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Knock-out', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Prophylactic treatment', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Statistical Distributions', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'T-cell receptor repertoire', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Vaccination', 'Vaccine Design', 'Vaccines', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm training', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biochemical model', 'cancer immunotherapy', 'cancer therapy', 'complex data ', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fighting', 'functional group', 'in vivo', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'large datasets', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'pathogen', 'progenitor', 'receptor', 'repaired', 'response', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAID,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,710049,-0.007683127829770131
"Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics specifically and potently block the expression of disease-related genes. siRNA clinical utility is currently limited to disease targets in the liver, but the Khvorova lab has developed a novel, fully chemically modified siRNA platform that enables delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) and results in potent modulation of gene expression in mouse and monkey brain for 6 months. This technology provides an opportunity to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders, including Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Extensive chemical modification protects siRNAs from degradation and is essential for in vivo delivery, but lowers the gene silencing efficacy of many siRNA sequences. Bioinformatics algorithms have been developed to predict the activity of non-modified siRNAs, but these algorithms cannot predict whether a chemically modified siRNA will be functional. Identifying a hyperfunctional siRNA chemical modification pattern and developing a predictive algorithm for modified siRNA sequences will be critical for the widespread application of this platform in vivo to treat AD and other genetically-linked neurological disorders. The goal of this proposal is to identify parameters that impact the silencing efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs. Aim 1 will identify the step(s) that limit the activity of chemically modified siRNAs. Using a validated AGO2- immunoprecipitation technique and a small RNA high-throughput sequencing protocol, loading of 32 chemically modified siRNA sequences, each with 3 different chemical modification patterns, into RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) will be quantified, and these results will be compared to their in vitro silencing activity. These efforts will provide a data set to determine the impacts of chemistry and sequence on the different steps of RISC function. Aim 2 will design and screen 192 siRNAs in 6 different chemical modification patterns (i.e., for a total of 1152 siRNAs) to systematically assess if and how changes to siRNA sequence and chemical modification patterns impact siRNA efficacy. These 1152 siRNAs will target 4 different mRNAs identified as therapeutic targets for AD. Completing this aim will identify siRNAs that effectively reduce the expression of AD targets. Using multiple bioinformatics analysis methods, including multi-parameter linear regression, support vector machine, and random forest, Aim 3 will model algorithms that specifically predict functional, chemically modified siRNAs. The best performing algorithm will be determined by independent and cross-validations. Completion of this project will decrease the extent of in vitro screening needed to identify functional chemically modified siRNAs capable of targeting disease genes in the CNS and streamline the design of siRNA therapies to treat genetically-defined neurological disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics are a promising class of drugs for the treatment of genetic disorders. Chemical modification of siRNA is necessary for delivery to the central nervous system, but may hinder the efficacy of some siRNAs. This project will define the relationships between siRNA sequence, chemical modification patterns, and efficacy to streamline the development of clinically-relevant siRNAs capable of treating genetically-defined neurological disorders.",Defining the Rules for Designing Fully Chemically Modified siRNAs to Treat Genetically Linked Central Nervous System Disorders,9992249,F31LM013111,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Central Nervous System Diseases', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hela Cells', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Huntington Disease', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Liver', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Monkeys', 'Mus', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA Degradation', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA Interference Therapy', 'RNA Sequences', 'RNA-Induced Silencing Complex', 'Seeds', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Small RNA', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thermodynamics', 'Toxic effect', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'preference', 'random forest', 'screening', 'support vector machine', 'therapeutic RNA', 'therapeutic target']",NLM,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,F31,2020,30514,-0.04289565672288981
"Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences Project Summary We will develop and apply a new high-throughput methodology for rapidly designing and testing antibodies for a myriad of purposes, including cancer and infectious disease immunotherapeutics. We will improve upon current approaches for antibody design by providing time, cost, and humane benefits over immunized animal methods and greatly improving the power of present synthetic methods that use randomized designs. To accomplish this, we will display millions of computationally designed antibody sequences using recently available technology, test the displayed antibodies in a high-throughput format at low cost, and use the resulting test data to train molecular dynamics and machine learning methods to generate new sequences for testing. Based on our test data our computational method will identify sequences that have ideal properties for target binding and therapeutic efficacy. We will accomplish these goals with three specific aims. We will develop a new approach to integrated molecular dynamics and machine learning using control targets and known receptor sequences to refine our methods for receptor generalization and model updating from observed data (Aim 1). We will design an iterative framework intended to enable identification of highly effective antibodies within a minimal number of experiments, in which our methods automatically propose promising antibody sequences to profile in subsequent assays (Aim 2). We will employ rounds of automated synthetic design, affinity test, and model improvement to produce highly target-specific antibodies. (Aim 3). ! Project Narrative We will develop new computational methods that learn from millions of examples to design antibodies that can be used to help cure a wide variety of human diseases such as cancer and viral infection. Previous antibody design approaches used a trial and error approach to find antibodies that worked well. In contrast our mathematical methods will directly produce new antibody designs by learning from large-scale experiments that test antibodies for function against disease targets. !",Deep learning based antibody design using high-throughput affinity testing of synthetic sequences,9878070,R01CA218094,"['Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Binding', 'Biological Assay', 'Budgets', 'Classification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Computing Methodologies', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Fc Receptor', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immunize', 'Immunotherapeutic agent', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Machines', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Output', 'Performance', 'Phage Display', 'Property', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Services', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Update', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'cloud based', 'commercialization', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'iterative design', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical methods', 'molecular dynamics', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive test', 'receptor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2020,591130,0.009155920554943207
"Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data Big data is now ubiquitous in every field of modern scientific research. Many contemporary applications, such as the recent national microbiome initiative (NMI), greatly demand highly flexible statistical machine learning methods that can produce both interpretable and reproducible results. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify crucial causal factors that are responsible for the response from a large number of available covariates, which can be statistically formulated as the false discovery rate (FDR) control in general high-dimensional nonlinear models. Despite the enormous applications of shotgun metagenomic studies, most existing investigations concentrate on the study of bacterial organisms. However, viruses and virus-host interactions play important roles in controlling the functions of the microbial communities. In addition, viruses have been shown to be associated with complex diseases. Yet, investigations into the roles of viruses in human diseases are significantly underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to develop mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches to deal with highly complex big data and the applications of these approaches to solve fundamental and important biological and biomedical problems. There are four interrelated aims. In Aim 1, we will theoretically investigate the power of the recently proposed model-free knockoffs (MFK) procedure, which has been theoretically justified to control FDR in arbitrary models and arbitrary dimensions. We will also theoretically justify the robustness of MFK with respect to the misspecification of covariate distribution. These studies will lay the foundations for our developments in other aims. In Aim 2, we will develop deep learning approaches to predict viral contigs with higher accuracy, integrate our new algorithm with MFK to achieve FDR control for virus motif discovery, and investigate the power and robustness of our new procedure. In Aim 3, we will take into account the virus-host motif interactions and adapt our algorithms and theories in Aim 2 for predicting virus-host infectious interaction status. In Aim 4, we will apply the developed methods from the first three aims to analyze the shotgun metagenomics data sets in ExperimentHub to identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with several diseases at some target FDR level. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for metagenomics studies under a variety of environments. Big data is ubiquitous in biological research. Identifying causal factors associated with complex diseases or traits from big data is highly important and challenging. New statistical and computational tools will be developed to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) for molecular sequence data based on the novel model-free knockoffs framework. They will be used to detect sequence motifs for viruses and motif-pairs for virus-host interactions, and to analyze multiple metagenomics data sets related to complex diseases.",Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data,9923688,R01GM131407,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archaea', 'Attention', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Mathematics', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Non-linear Models', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Shotguns', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'model design', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'power analysis', 'response', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'theories', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction', 'virus identification']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,276700,0.005945918981120366
"Making antibody generation rapid, scalable, and democratic through machine learning and continuous evolution Project Summary/Abstract It is hard to overstate the importance of monoclonal antibodies in the life sciences. Antibodies are critical tools in biomedical research and diagnostics (e.g. western blotting, immunoprecipitation, cytometry, biomarker discovery, and histology), are one of the most rapidly growing class of therapeutics, and are the basis for myriad new strategies in cancer therapy, such as checkpoint inhibitors that are revolutionizing treatment. Unfortunately, current methods for the generation of custom antibodies, including animal immunization and phage display, are slow, costly, inaccessible to most researchers, and often unsuccessful. We propose Autonomously EvolvinG Yeast-displayed antibodieS (AEGYS), a system for the continuous and rapid evolution of high-quality antibodies against custom antigens that requires only the simple culturing of yeast cells. We believe this can be achieved by combining cutting-edge generative machine learning algorithms for antibody library design with a new technology for in vivo continuous evolution and a yeast antigen-presenting cell that we will engineer. If successful, AEGYS should have a transformative impact across the whole of biomedicine by turning monoclonal antibody generation into a rapid, scalable, and accessible process where any lab with standard molecular biology capabilities can generate custom antibodies on demand simply by “immunizing” a test tube of yeast cells with an antigen. We anticipate that this democratization of antibody generation will also result in an explosion of crowdsourced antibody sequence data that will train our machine learning algorithms to design better antibody libraries for AEGYS, starting a virtuous cycle. We ourselves will use AEGYS to generate a panel of subtype- and conformation-specific nanobodies against biogenic amine receptors including those that respond to acetylcholine, adrenaline, dopamine, and other neurotransmitters, so that we can understand their role in neurobiology and addiction.! Project Narrative This proposal will provide a system for the scalable continuous evolution and computational design of antibodies against user-selected antigens. Antibodies are critical tools in medical research and are the basis for numerous therapies, but the generation of custom antibodies against new targets is a difficult and specialized task. The system proposed will turn antibody generation into a routine and widely accessible process for researchers in almost any field.","Making antibody generation rapid, scalable, and democratic through machine learning and continuous evolution",10021311,R01CA260415,"['Acetylcholine', 'Affinity', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells', 'Antigens', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Back', 'Biogenic Amine Receptors', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biomedical Research', 'Cell Surface Receptors', 'Cells', 'Chemistry', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Cultured Cells', 'Custom', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detergents', 'Diagnostic', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Docking', 'Dopamine', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Epidemic', 'Epinephrine', 'Evolution', 'Explosion', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Hybridomas', 'Image', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunize', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Research', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Monoclonal Antibodies', 'Neuraxis', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Nobel Prize', 'Outcome', 'Pathogen detection', 'Phage Display', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pheromone', 'Play', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Production', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Public Health', 'Reagent', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Training', 'Tube', 'Update', 'V(D)J Recombination', 'Western Blotting', 'Yeasts', 'addiction', 'antibody engineering', 'antibody libraries', 'antigen binding', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'cancer therapy', 'cost', 'crowdsourcing', 'decision research', 'design', 'empowered', 'experimental study', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'nanobodies', 'new technology', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'scaffold', 'structural biology', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R01,2020,1690552,0.005033719457183831
"Deep learning approaches to decipher the impact of mobile element insertion on alternative splicing in neurological disorders The purpose of this training and research application is to study the functional impact of mobile element insertions (MEIs) in neurological disorders (NDs) using new developments in deep learning techniques. MEIs are transposable DNA fragments that are able to insert throughout the human genome. There are at least 124 independent MEIs associated with human diseases. Approximately 20% of these diseases represent a spectrum of NDs, yet the overall contribute of MEIs to the etiology of NDs has not been systematically estimated. To address this, we will (1) characterize functional MEIs in GTEx cohorts in healthy individuals; (2) build a comprehensive functional map of MEIs to determine tissue-specific and brain-specific impact; and (3) impute transcriptional changes on various NDs where whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data will be generated. The proposed application will also develop an extensive research program for Dr. Dadi Gao, a computational biologist and statistical geneticist who has trained in functional genomic studies of alternative splicing in neurodegenerative disorders and therapeutic targeting of a splicing defect that causes a severe neurodevelopmental disorder. He has developed novel methods to investigate regulation of the transcriptome and to facilitate analyses in drug development. He now seeks to expand his expertise by applying statistical and deep learning models on large cohorts of sequencing data from controls and cases with NDs from post-mortem tissues, then impute functional consequences of MEIs from WGS in large-scale disease cohorts. The training plan consists of two years of mentored research to learn new skills in genome analysis, MEI characterization, and advanced deep learning techniques, followed by three years of shaping an independent laboratory. The research plan is developed to comprehensively explore functional variation in the genome by decomposing transcriptomic changes against MEIs. Dr. Michael Talkowski at Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard, and the Broad Institute will serve as the primary mentor, while Dr. Manolis Kellis at MIT and the MIT Computational Biology Group, and the Broad Institute will serve as a co-mentor and close collaborator. These mentors are recognized experts in genomic structural variants, functional genomics, the genetics of neurological disorders, and computational modeling to establish functional elements in the human genome. In addition, a team of independent investigators from basic and translational research will provide Dr. Gao with comprehensive feedback to keep both his science and career development on track. The highly collaborative environment in CGM, MGH, Harvard Medical School, the Broad Institute and the University of Michigan Medical School will prepare Dr. Gao for his transition to an independent investigator. This outstanding mentorship team and training program will facilitate the career development of Dr. Gao as he seeks to redefine the functional maps of MEIs in the human genome and to impute their impact in large-scale neurological disorders. Mobile element insertions (MEIs) represent a largely undefined component of the genetic architecture of neurological disorders, as a number of MEIs have been associated with alternative splicing in these disorders but large-scale genome-wide functional characterization has not been systematically performed across tissues. This program study will functionally characterize the impact of MEIs on alternative splicing from whole-genome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing in large cohorts using new developments in deep learning models. These results will enhance our understanding of the etiological role and pathogenic mechanisms associated with MEIs in neuronal development and human neurological disorders.",Deep learning approaches to decipher the impact of mobile element insertion on alternative splicing in neurological disorders,10041366,K99NS118109,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Autopsy', 'Basic Science', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'CRISPR/Cas technology', 'Cells', 'Chromosome Pairing', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Biology', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Models', 'DNA', 'DNA Insertion Elements', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Dorsal', 'Dystonia', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Excision Repair', 'Familial Dysautonomia', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Filipino', 'General Hospitals', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Haplotypes', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'International', 'Introns', 'Laboratories', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Mind', 'Minisatellite Repeats', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mosaicism', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neuromuscular Diseases', 'Neurons', 'Outcome', 'Parkinsonian Disorders', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retroelements', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Short Interspersed Nucleotide Elements', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'TAF1 gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Tissue-Specific Splicing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Transcription Alteration', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'brain tissue', 'career development', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'drug development', 'functional genomics', 'functional outcomes', 'gene function', 'genetic architecture', 'genome analysis', 'genome editing', 'genome sequencing', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'in silico', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'mind control', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuron development', 'novel', 'programs', 'response', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'structural genomics', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2020,91226,-0.009618705884447387
"Integrated Instrument for non-natural aptamer generation Project Summary DNA and RNA aptamers are a useful class of synthetic affinity reagents. However, their performance can be greatly improved through the site-specific incorporation of chemically modified, ‘non-natural’ nucleotides that provide a greater chemical repertoire to enable superior aptamer affinity and specificity. Because a broad spectrum of chemical functional groups can be incorporated, non-natural aptamers offer the exciting potential for targeting molecules for which the generation of monoclonal antibodies remains difficult, such as small- molecule drugs, metabolites and carbohydrates. Unfortunately, the access to non-natural aptamers is severely limited. This is because the process of generating non-natural aptamers is technically challenging and limited to a few specialized laboratories. The goal of this project is to develop an integrated instrument, the Non-Natural Aptamer Array (N2A2) that eliminates these bottlenecks and enable rapid and facile non-natural aptamer discovery at virtually any research laboratory. The N2A2 will be built on a modified version of a benchtop commercial sequencer (Illumina MiSeq), and will perform every stage of non-natural aptamer discovery— including sequencing, screening and binding measurements—as part of a single work-flow. There are three main innovative aspects of our N2A2 system. First, our approach will entirely eliminate the need for polymerase engineering, and thus allows us to incorporate virtually any chemical functional group through click chemistry. Second, N2A2 will enable us to directly obtain the binding affinity (Kd) of ~10^7 aptamers directly in complex samples (e.g. cell lysate or serum), thereby resulting in aptamers with high-specificity. Finally, we will develop a machine-learning (ML) approach to identify key motifs (“k-mers”) and predict novel sequences with potentially higher affinity and specificity that can be tested using the N2A2 instrument. We believe this powerful combination of massively parallel, sequence-linked binding measurements with ML-based predictions will allow us to explore sequence space that is currently inaccessible to traditional in vitro selection methods, and enable us to discover aptamers with superior performance. The success of this project will produce an integrated instrument that greatly streamlines and accelerates the discovery of non-natural aptamers for a wide range of targets in complex media. The instrument is based on a commercially available sequencer and we will make all software available to the public. In this way, we believe the N2A2 instrument could broadly expand access to robust, high quality, custom affinity reagents for biomedical research and clinical diagnostics. Project Narrative We will develop an integrated instrument that simplifies the discovery of non-natural aptamer reagents for a wide range of molecules that are difficult to target using conventional antibody reagents.

"Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor-DNA Binding Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT SUMMARY Genes are regulated through transcription factor (TF) binding to specific DNA target sites in the genome. These target sites are recognized through several layers of specificity determinants. The most extensively studied layer of binding specificity are hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic contacts between protein amino acids and functional groups of the base pairs mainly in the major groove. Base readout recognizes nucleotide sequence within a short core-binding site of only a few base pairs. However, these distinct sequence combinations in a TF binding motif occur many times in the genome and only a very small fraction of putative binding sites are functional. It is still unknown how a TF locates and identifies its in vivo binding sites in the plethora of possible genomic target sites. Recognition of three-dimensional DNA structure is an additional layer that refines base readout. While the latter is restricted to direct contacts with the core motif, shape readout is a mechanism through which flanking regions of the core motif or spacer regions between half-sites of dimeric TFs contribute to binding specificity. Other layers of in vivo TF binding determinants are chromatin structure, DNA accessibility, histone modifications, DNA methylation, cofactors and cooperative binding, and cell type. Given this multi-layer nature of TF recognition, we will develop quantitative models to predict TF binding with high accuracy. More important, however, is that our models will reveal recognition mechanisms in the absence of experiment-based structural information. We will build models where each distinct layer of TF binding specificity determinants is added to a base-line model combining DNA sequence and shape. Since it is expected that the importance of each of these TF binding specificity determinants will vary dramatically across protein families, we will use feature selection to identify relative contributions of each feature group as a function of TF or TF family. We will also develop a deep learning framework where individual feature modules can be added or removed from the input layer of convolutional neural networks. This approach will leverage the advantages of deep learning while circumventing the “black box” nature of standard deep learning methods. We will also generate experimental data for specific TFs using the SELEX-seq technology. This approach is currently able to probe the effect of cofactors, cooperative binding, and protein mutations on the binding specificity of a TF. We will add nucleosomes to the SELEX-seq binding assay and, thereby, probe chromatin effects on TF binding using an in vitro experiment in the absence of other cellular contributions. This project will result in a better mechanistic understanding of TF-DNA binding and reveal the impact of various specificity determinants across multiple scales. The new insights will describe different combinations of readout mechanisms on a protein-family specific basis. Our new methods will yield progress in biomedical innovation that is based on transcription and gene regulation. The generated knowledge will better integrate genomics and biophysics, and the project will contribute to the training and mentoring of a new generation of scientists. Title: Quantitative Modeling of Transcription Factor–DNA Binding PI: Rohs, Remo PROJECT NARRATIVE Gene regulatory mechanisms require the binding of transcription factors to highly selective target sites in the genome. By itself, the DNA sequence of the core motif is often insufficient to explain transcription factor binding to a very small fraction of the many more available putative sites.

"Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling PROJECT SUMMARY The human body comprises of trillion of cells, which are the building blocks of life. Each cell is highly organized, with various constituents within localizing to specific regions. Location within a cell is a cardinal organizing principle of gene control and function, especially for RNAs that code for proteins or serve regulatory roles as non-coding RNAs. Each cell type has its distinct RNA-species profile, and where these RNAs are located within the cell can dictate their folding, editing, splicing, translation, degradation, binding partners, catalytic activity, and even the fate of the proteins that they encode. Unsurprisingly, perturbations in RNA localization result in disease conditions including cancers and neuropathologies. In spite of the vital importance of subcellular RNA localization in gene expression, investigating such phenomena simultaneously for many RNA species has been challenging. To address these long-standing issues, Dr. Furqan Fazal and others have recently developed a technique called APEX-seq that can track the location of thousands of RNAs in living human cells with high-temporal and nanometer-spatial resolution. APEX-seq has the transformative potential to provide high-resolution snapshots of tens of thousands of endogenous cellular RNA species, free from artifacts of overexpression, cell fixation or recombinant tagging. This proposal outlines a five-year career program for Dr. Fazal as he investigates principles of RNA subcellular localization, and reaches milestone goals that will transition him into an independent investigator. By improving the APEX-seq technique and amalgamating it with a number of cutting-edge tools including massively-parallel reporter assays and deep-learning-based approaches, Dr. Fazal will dissect how sequences within RNAs direct them to different locations, and how cells actively control RNA subcellular localization to regulate gene function. This work will be carried out at Stanford University, where Dr. Fazal will be mentored by Dr. Howard Chang, a pioneer in developing new genomics tools, and Dr. Joanna Wysocka, a leading authority in vertebrate development and non-coding genomic regulatory elements. Both mentors have highly-successful track records of placing postdoctoral fellows into independent academic positions at leading institutions around the nation and world. Additional support will be available through collaboration with Drs. Shen, Boettiger and Kundaje who will provide training and expertise in genetics, imaging, statistics and computation. An advisory committee comprising of world-leading investigators Drs. Ting, Kool, Li, Bryant and Bassik will also monitor progress and provide expertise. Further acquisition of scientific and professional skills will be achieved by utilizing the educational resources available through the Stanford University School of Medicine and Office of Postdoctoral Affairs. Stanford provides an outstanding intellectually-stimulating environment with all facilities and resources necessary for success, and all proposed training will complement Dr. Fazal’s previous knowledge in genomics and biophysics and facilitate his transition into a multidisciplinary RNA biologist in the field of spatial transcriptomics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Many RNA species within a cell are spatially localized and locally translated into proteins, and previous studies in embryos, neurons and highly-dynamic tissues have demonstrated the vital importance of RNA subcellular location in development and cellular function. However, it has been challenging to study localization transcriptome-wide, which has hampered understanding of the extent and role of such processes in normal and diseased tissues. The proposed work will improve a newly-developed tool for the RNA community to investigate spatial transcriptomics, and use it to provide new insights into RNA biology by determining the regulatory sequences (i.e. the grammar) controlling localization, as well as identifying the associated cellular mechanisms.",Revealing Principles of Subcellular RNA Localization by Proximity Labeling,10016780,K99HG010910,"['3-Dimensional', 'Active Biological Transport', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Animal Model', 'Binding', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Caenorhabditis elegans', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Cis-Acting Sequence', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA', 'DNA Library', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Disease', 'Dynein ATPase', 'Elements', 'Embryo', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Fractionation', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heterochromatin', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Institution', 'Kinesin', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Life', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mentors', 'Messenger RNA', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular Motors', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myosin ATPase', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Envelope', 'Nuclear Lamina', 'Nuclear Pore', 'Organelles', 'Outer Mitochondrial Membrane', 'Pattern', 'Peroxidases', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA Transport', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Recombinants', 'Records', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repetitive Sequence', 'Reporter', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Retrotransposon', 'Role', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Small Nuclear RNA', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Writing', 'active control', 'authority', 'base', 'career', 'cell fixation', 'cell type', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'design', 'education resources', 'experience', 'gene function', 'genomic tools', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'insertion/deletion mutation', 'insight', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanometer', 'neuropathology', 'overexpression', 'programs', 'ribosome profiling', 'skills', 'statistics', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,81284,0.03071120479604858
"Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo. ABSTRACT: “Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo”  microRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small regulatory RNAs involved in repression of gene expression. They recognize their target mRNAs though base pairing and upon binding, trigger translational repression, deadenylation and decay of the target mRNAs. Given that each miRNA has the potential to regulate hundreds of genes, and several dozens of miRNAs are expressed in each cell type, miRNAs are one of the master regulators of gene expression at post-transcriptional level in animals, plants and virus. Thus, the elucidation of the miRNA complement is essential to understand gene regulation and mRNA turnover. The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method for miRNA discovery and experimental validation in vivo.  Current miRNA discovery methods heavily rely on providing sequencing evidence of a small RNA that fits into a hairpin-like structure predicted bioinformatically. The problem is that sample availability or the abundance of a specific cell type in a tissue may be limited and hamper the number of miRNAs that can be backed-up with sequencing support. In these situations, the current solution is to sequence deeper, increasing overall costs. On the other hand, the presence of a small RNA of ~22-nt does not guarantee the belonging to the miRNA family, as random degradation of cellular RNAs also will produce small RNAs of this size and only tedious experimental validation of their processing into intermediate species and mature miRNA can confirm their identity.  A recent curation work found that of the over ~7,000 metazoan miRNAs in miRBase, the reference miRNA database, only 1,175 fulfilled the features necessary to pass as miRNAs, directly rejected 3,470 as false positives and lacked enough sequencing evidence to call another 2,105 miRNAs. Therefore, there is an unmet technological need to develop a miRNA validation method that boosts the access to the miRNA candidates even from limited samples and that allows rigorous multiplexed experimental validation of their processing.  With the synergy of an interdisciplinary team that combines expertise in microRNAs and zebrafish manipulation (Dr. Cifuentes, PI) and bioinformatics (Dr. Moxon, co-I), we will develop miRAGe (miRNA Analysis Genome wide), a high-throughput method to integrate miRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. The fundamental concept behind miRAGe is the use of living cells as “organic computers” to analyze miRNA processing. We will use massively parallel oligo pool synthesis to prepare the miRNA candidate precursors and test their processing in injected zebrafish embryos. Small RNA sequencing will determine which candidates are true microRNA by detecting their ~22-nucleotide mature product and their stereotypic intermediates.  Overall, the results from this project will transform the access of the scientific community to high quality, experimentally validated miRNA data from any organism with genomic data available, thus enhancing future transversal studies on post-transcriptional regulation. NARRATIVE The goal of this project is to develop a high-throughput method to integrate microRNA prediction and their experimental validation in vivo. We will take advantage of oligo pool synthesis to prepare the microRNA candidate precursors and test their processing after injection in zebrafish embryos. Small RNA sequencing data will determine which of the candidates is a true microRNA by detecting the ~22-nucleotide mature product.",Developing a high-throughput method to validate microRNA biogenesis in vivo.,10043005,R21GM138951,"['Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Back', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biogenesis', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Embryo', 'Enzymes', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Injections', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Northern Blotting', 'Nucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Organism', 'Plant Viruses', 'Post-Transcriptional Regulation', 'Process', 'RNA', 'RNA analysis', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribonuclease III', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Shapes', 'Small RNA', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Repression', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'base', 'cell type', 'cost', 'deep sequencing', 'exhaustion', 'gene repression', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genomic data', 'genomic predictors', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'novel strategies', 'prediction algorithm', 'support vector machine', 'synergism', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R21,2020,248333,-0.0044163076543955225
"Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Computational Studies of Virus-host Interactions Using Metagenomics Data and Applications Summary: Viruses are ubiquitous in almost every ecological environment including the human body, water, soil, etc. They play important roles in the normal function of human microbiome. Many viruses have been shown to be associated with human diseases. However, our understanding of the roles of viruses in ecological communities is very limited. Recent technological and computational advances make it possible to have a deep understanding of the roles of viruses in public health and the environment. Metagenomics studies from various environments including the human microbiome projects (HMP), global ocean, and the earth microbiome projects have generated large amounts of short read data.

For the identification of viral sequences from metagenomics samples, novel statistical measures using word patterns will first be developed. Second, a unified naïve Bayesian integrative approach by combining information from word patterns, gene directionality, and gene annotation will be studied. Third, the identified viral sequences from metagenomes will be further assembled to construct complete viral genomes using a novel binning approach to be developed by the investigators.

"Advanced algorithms to infer and analyze 3D genome structures Project Summary For the past decade, the population-cell Hi-C technique has significantly improved our ability to discover genome-wide DNA proximities. However, because population Hi-C is based on a pool of cells, it will not help us reveal each single cell's 3D genome structure or understand cell-to-cell variability in terms of 3D genome structure and gene regulation. It is also difficult to achieve a high resolution, such as 1 Kbp, with population Hi- C; therefore, when finding and analyzing the spatial interactions for the promoter or enhancer regions typically associated with biologically-important regulatory elements, population Hi-C data's resolution is too low to be useful. Moreover, while we know that the CTCF-cohesin complex plays a key role in the formation of genome 3D structures, the question is whether long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the process since lncRNAs have been found to recruit proteins needed for chromatin remodeling, and our preliminary research has found that lncRNA LINC00346 directly interacts with CTCF. Finally, while members of the bioinformatics community, including the PI, have developed many algorithms to reconstruct 3D genome structures based on population Hi-C data, important questions still must be answered regarding how 3D genome structures are involved in gene regulation and whether there are relationships between 3D genome structures and genetic and epigenetic features. The PI proposes to conduct leading research to overcome these challenges and address these questions. During the next five years, the PI will develop algorithms to reconstruct the 3D whole- genome structures for single cells and analyze cell-to-cell variabilities in terms of 3D genome structure and gene regulation. The PI will develop a deep learning algorithm to enhance the resolution of population Hi-C data to that of Capture Hi-C data (1 Kbp) so that we can make good use of the large amount of Hi-C data accumulated in the past decade. An online database will be built to allow the community to access both population and single-cell 3D genome structures in an integrated way. The PI will work with a cancer biologist to discover any lncRNAs that function as a scaffold to fine-tune the CTCF-cohesin protein complex, as well as two neuron scientists to develop a more complete understanding of gene regulation while considering 3D genome and other genetic and epigenetic features. Given the PI's track record and productivity, having three computational goals and two collaborative goals is not only feasible but computationally and biologically rewarding. In five years, once the proposed studies are accomplished, the PI should have established a uniquely independent place in the field of 3D genome, maintaining leading positions in inferring single-cell 3D genome structures, enhancing Hi-C data resolution, and building 3D genome databases, while establishing similar positions in reconstructing high-resolution 3D genome structures, finding lncRNAs' roles in the formation of genome structures, and understanding how 3D genome structures are involved in gene regulation. Project Narrative The three-dimensional (3D) structure of genome is critically important for gene regulation; and the abnormal 3D genome structures are often associated with diseases such as cancer. This proposal aims to reconstruct and analyze the 3D genome structures of thousands of individual cells, study how 3D genome structures participate in gene regulation, determine whether long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the formation of genome structures, and build an online knowledge base integrating 3D genome structures with other biological information.",Advanced algorithms to infer and analyze 3D genome structures,10027542,R35GM137974,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic', 'Genome', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Neurons', 'Other Genetics', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Regulatory Element', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Work', 'base', 'chromatin remodeling', 'cohesin', 'deep learning algorithm', 'genome database', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'member', 'promoter', 'protein complex', 'recruit', 'scaffold', 'three dimensional structure', 'whole genome']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,R35,2020,354694,-0.048571021963658444
"New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures RNA molecules play fundamental roles in nearly all cellular processes at the level of gene expression and regulation. Not surprisingly, emerging biomedical advances such as precision medicine and synthetic biology all point to RNA as the central regulators and information carriers. Recently, realizing the potential of using RNA to intervene gene expression, scientists successfully developed Onpattro, the ﬁrst FDA-approved RNA-based therapy in August 2018.  Understanding RNA function and therapeutic applications requires knowledge about RNA structure. Unfortu- nately, currently, the number of the known structures is a small fraction of what need to be determined. This gap has to be closed by computational methods. Furthermore, an RNA molecule is a highly charged polyanion and positive charges such as metal ions bind to an RNA and for an integral part of an RNA structure. Where and how metal ions interact with an RNA can directly impact RNA structure and function as well as RNA-drug interactions.  Continuously supported by NIH for over 15 years, we have developed systematic computational tools for the predictions of RNA structures, folding stability, kinetics, and metal ion effects. These tools have led to fruitful applications in virology, microbiology, gene therapy, RNA biotechnology, and various RNA-based therapeutic de- signs. However, despite over decade of efforts, many critical issues in computational RNA biology still remain: de novo prediction of non-Watson-Crick interactions, structure prediction for large RNAs, effective incorporation of experimental data such as cryo-EM and NMR data into structure prediction, and modeling of metal ion ef- fects. In this grant, after 15 years of developing an initio physics-based models, we propose to target the above and other pressing issues using a fundamentally different approach by systematically developing data-driven (such as deep-learning) or hybrid data-driven/physics-based simulation methods. The new approaches are mo- tivated by the increasing amount of experimental data and the pressing need to have more efﬁcient and reliable computational tools for data interpretation, especially for structure determination experiments. We will use ex- perimental database, such as RNA-Puzzles database, PDB, EMDataBank, BMRB, for large-scale benchmark tests, and biochemical and NMR data collected by our well-established collaborators for in-depth and interactive information about various experiments such as HCV genomic RNAs and HIV PBS systems. Our goal, if success- fully accomplished, will immediately impact experiments such as structure determination, including cryo-EM and NMR-based structure determination, identiﬁcation of metal ion sites, and rational design of RNA structures for therapeutic applications. RNA structures and interactions hold the key to many important biological processes. This project develops cutting-edge computational methods for the predictions of RNA structures and interactions. The results from the project will lead to novel computational tools for understanding disease mechanism at molecular level and for the rational design of RNA-based therapeutics. !",New methods for computational modeling of RNA structures,9851572,R35GM134919,"['Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cell physiology', 'Charge', 'Computer Models', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Drug Interactions', 'FDA approved', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Hepatitis C virus', 'Hybrids', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Metal Ion Binding', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Physics', 'Play', 'RNA', 'RNA Computations', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'gene therapy', 'genomic RNA', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'polyanion', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'simulation', 'success', 'synthetic biology', 'tool', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R35,2020,240392,0.07185091556045788
"Programmable RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas tools to study RNA biology Summary Technological advances such as next-generation sequencing and single-cell analysis have opened the flood gates for RNA analysis, revealing that the transcriptome is significantly more complex than previously thought, both with respect to the diversity of RNA transcripts, their temporal expression dynamics, and their cellular location. Moreover, thousands of dysregulated RNAs have been observed in diseases including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. These observations underscore the dire need for new molecular tools to precisely dissect RNA function in health and disease. The goal of my research program is to harness the unprecedented power of CRISPR-Cas systems to create a versatile range of methods to precisely manipulate virtually any RNA, and to use these tools to explore fundamental knowledge gaps in RNA biology. This proposal specifically focuses on addressing the following knowledge gaps: 1) Despite the technological advances in harnessing RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas enzymes Cas9 and Cas13 for research and clinical applications, we still do not understand the principles of gRNA selection for efficient and tunable RNA-targeting. This problem precludes the facile development of a number of RNA-targeting applications and underscores the need for a thorough interrogation of gRNA selection. Our goal here is to develop a model to predict highly-active gRNAs for Cas9/Cas13 RNA- targeting in human cells. We will use a combination of high-throughput RNA:protein interactome methods, flow- cytometry based gRNA screens and machine learning to precisely define features of highly active RNA-targeting gRNAs for RNA-binding and knockdown for Cas9 and Cas13. 2) The vast majority of human RNAs are alternatively spliced, and RNA splicing defects are common in cancers and neurological diseases. However, our understanding of the downstream functional effects of splicing in a majority of cases is rudimentary. To address this issue, we will develop a toolbox of robust, multiplexable Cas-based splicing factors to offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the functional consequences of alternative splicing. that can determine in a single step both the identity of proteins bound to a And 3) There is a paucity of methods specific RNA and their location on that RNA. The development of such an approach will enable us to determine the spatial arrangement of proteins on specific RNAs to dissect their dynamic deposition in range of RNA processes such as transcription, 3ʹ-end and micro-RNA processing, and lncRNA function. To address this issue, we propose to develop a genetically encodable Cas-based RNA proximity-labeling strategy to precisely identify proteins that bind in close proximity to a specific RNA sequence. We will then use this approach to identify protein factors involved in regulating microprocessor (Drosha/DGCR8) activity at specific primary micro-RNA loci. These research goals fully align with the NIGMS 5 Year Strategic Plan, through the development of essential research tools to study and RNA function for biomedical research.

"Integrative approach to studying LncRNA functions ABSTRACT  Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play regulatory roles in biological cell process and disease development. It has been emerging as a key regulator of diverse cellular processes. Great efforts have been made towards investigation of lncRNA functions with both experimental determination and theoretical modeling, leading to a rudimentary understanding of this class of RNAs. However, all of these cannot keep pace with the fast growth of diverse genetic data and urgent request of individual lncRNA function annotation, which is inhibited by the tremendous amount of lncRNAs and expensive experimental cost. This propose aim to address this issue by providing efficient and user-friendly tools for key lncRNA discovery and lncRNA function annotation. To do so, we will develop a unique bioinformatics and Systems Biology integrated approach, ISSNLncFA system, which enables the integration of all sorts of omics data and a comprehensive understanding of lncRNA functions.  We propose three specific aims for the ultimate lncRNA function annotation: (1) To develop a novel Co- Modules-based LncRNA Function Annotation (CoMoLncFA) model to detect key lncRNAs and to annotate lncRNA functions at post transcription level as lncRNA-PCG co-modules, lncRNA-pathways association network and lncRNA’s triplets (lncRNA-miRNA/TF-PCG) by considering the expression profiles of lncRNA, protein coding genes and miRNAs and transcript factors, and integrating the curated protein-protein interactions and biological pathways. (2) To develop a novel Structure-based LncRNA-protein Function Annotation (STRULncFA) model to characterize lncRNAs identified from Aim 1 by using their primary sequences and secondary structures for detecting lncRNA-protein functional relations; and to further reveal the regulatory roles and mechanism of these lncRNAs by determining the binding sites in both lncRNA and protein. (3) To experimentally validate the identified abnormal lncRNAs and their cellular products, to validate the identified lncRNA-protein interacting pairs and the predicted binding sites, and to develop software tools and an environment for functional annotation of lncRNAs, use these tools to evaluate the overall proposed approach, and apply them to identify lncRNA functions that may be involved in cell states, species, diseases and cancers and build lncRNA function databases.  We believe that we will build the models, tools and databases, and make them available to the public in a timely fashion. Our achievements will lead to a complete understanding of lncRNA functions and regulatory roles in cell and disease states. Moreover, our models and tools will be feasibly transformed to other function annotation tasks and disease studies with appropriate changes, and thus will move forward the general function annotation community and disease-related drug or therapy development. Project Narrative The ISSNLncFA software package will allow the investigators to characterize the LncRNA functions by integrating RNA-Seq, micorRNA-Seq, and together with protein and RNA structure data with systems biology approaches. As a prototype to test our system, we aim to use this system to study myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs).

"Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules PROJECT SUMMARY  The transport of protons in biomolecular systems is a phenomenon of fundamental importance to processes such as ATP synthesis, enzyme catalysis, the maintenance of pH gradients, proton pumping, viral infection, and substrate/ion transport across membranes via protein transporters, symporters, and antiporters. Modeling biomolecular proton translocation in silico is a significant challenge due to the complex chemical reactions involved in Grotthuss proton shutting between water molecules and with protonatable amino acids, as well as the complexity of the target biomolecular systems. In most cases, it is not only important to understand the mechanism of proton binding and transport, but also its coupling to other mechanistically relevant biomolecular processes, such as protein conformational changes, substrate binding, other protonation events, and dynamic hydration.  In this project the continued development and application of a powerful multiscale computer simulation methodology is described for the study of proton transport in several key classes of proton translocating biomolecular systems, including channels (influenza A and B M2 channels), antiporters/symporters (ClC Cl-/H+ antiporter and phosphate transporter, respectively), and transporters (proton-coupled oligopeptide transporter and EmrE multidrug transporter). The overall research plan is made possible by a novel reactive molecular dynamics simulation approach integrated with quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods that allows for the study of explicit long-length and -time scale proton transport through water molecules and ionizable molecular groups in hydrogen-bonded networks, as well as by new innovations in enhanced free energy sampling methodology, machine learning, kinetic network theory, and coarse-graining. A primary goal in the research with this methodology in hand is to reveal the mechanisms of proton transport, as well as its coupling to hydration and conformational changes, in the above mentioned biomolecular systems. All of these studies will be carried out in collaboration with leading experimentalists, while continuing to add a new dimension to the field of biomolecular computer simulation as a whole. 1 PROJECT NARRATIVE  In this project, computer simulations will be used to study proton transport in several important biomolecular systems. Proton translocation is of fundamental significance throughout biology, as demonstrated by the pH-dependence of biomolecular structure and function and the central role of transmembrane proton gradients in bioenergy conversion. Moreover, understanding proton transport is of fundamental importance and direct relevance to numerous aspects of human health, including metabolism, aging, diabetes, neurodegeneration, retinal degeneration, antivral and anti-bacterial therapeutics, and homeostasis. 1",Simulation of Proton Translocation in Biomolecules,9934213,R01GM053148,"['ATP Synthesis Pathway', 'Achievement', 'Aging', 'Agreement', 'Amino Acids', 'Anions', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Catalysis', 'Charge', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Elements', 'Entropy', 'Enzymes', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Hand', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydration status', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Influenza', 'Influenza A virus', 'Influenza B Virus', 'Inorganic Phosphate Transporter', 'Ion Transport', 'Kinetics', 'Length', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Membrane', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Oligopeptides', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Progress Reports', 'Protein Conformation', 'Proteins', 'Proton Pump', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Quantum Mechanics', 'Reaction', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Support', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus Diseases', 'Water', 'Wisconsin', 'anti-influenza drug', 'antiporter', 'chemical bond', 'chemical reaction', 'experimental study', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'inorganic phosphate', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'migration', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular mechanics', 'multi drug transporter', 'novel', 'pH gradient', 'protonation', 'quantum', 'simulation', 'symporter', 'theories']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,310328,-0.018130290223208785
"High-Throughput De Novo Glycan Sequencing Glycosylation fulfills important physiological functions, including protein folding, embryogenesis, cell adhesion, pathogen recognition, and immune response. The multifaceted roles glycosylation plays derive from the presence of a range of glycan epitopes, where a small structural variation can have a profound impact on functions. Further, a glycome consists of many closely related structures, with their relative amounts determined by metabolic conditions in a cell- and growth-specific manner. Altered glycosylation is linked to many diseases, including cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological and autoimmune disorders, and cancer. Thus, there is a clear need for analytical methods that can rapidly identify and quantify the many glycoforms in a glycome from different health and disease states. Finally, no genome-predicted glycan database exists due to the unscripted nature of glycan biosynthesis, and discovery of new glycan structures must be achieved by de novo methods. Although tandem mass spectrometry-based biopolymer sequencing has been the major catalyst to the recent rapid advance of 'omics, the prevailing collisionally activated dissociation method often fails to provide sufficient glycan structural detail at the MS2 level, whereas the MSn approach lacks the speed, sensitivity, and quantitative potential for high-throughput glycome analysis. We have recently developed an electronic excitation dissociation (EED) method that can yield rich structural information in a single stage of MS/MS analysis. However, the impact of EED on glycomics research is currently limited by its poor accessibility, insufficient coupling to on-line glycan separation methods, and difficulty in interpretation of complex glycan EED tandem mass spectra. Here, we propose to develop an integrated approach that combines EED with on-line liquid chromatography (LC) separation and a novel bioinformatics tool to achieve high-throughput, de novo, and comprehensive glycome characterization. We will explore the potential of EED for analysis of glycans in various derivatized forms, study their fragmentation behaviors, and establish fragmentation rules for the development of bioinformatics software. We will optimize conditions for efficient coupling of EED to reversed-phase, and porous graphitic carbon LC, and develop an LC-EED-MS/MS approach for simultaneous characterization and quantitation of glycan mixtures. We will implement EED on a Q-TOF instrument to improve its access to the glycoscience community. Finally, we will develop and rigorously test the performance of a novel bioinformatics software that can rapidly and accurately determine each glycan's structure from its tandem MS spectra. The proposed algorithm is fundamentally different from most existing software, in that it no longer relies solely on glycosidic and cross-ring fragments for topology and linkage analysis, but rather adopts a machine learning approach that considers the contexts of various types of fragment peaks, and the spectral features associated with different linkage configurations and structural motifs. The availability of such a high-throughput, de novo glycan sequencing tool will have an immense impact on many biomedical research fields, as glycosylation plays critical roles in almost all biological pathways.

"Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data SUMMARY Alternative splicing (AS) is a gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human biology and disease. High throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-seq) is making it possible to survey the expressed genes and their alternative splicing variations in a wide variety of cellular conditions. However, the short reads are challenging to analyze, demanding highly sophisticated computational methods that can extract meaningful AS information efficiently, accurately, and in a comprehensive way. While there has been great progress so far, current methods based on assembling the short reads into transcript annotations have reached a plateau. We propose two innovations that can help overcome the limits. The first is one-step simultaneous analyses of multiple samples in an RNA-seq collection, in contrast with the current two-step approach that analyzes each sample separately and then merges the results. The second is to create and interrogate assembly-free representations of AS. The project will design a suite of tools that will leverage the latent information in large collections of samples and from heterogeneous data types to build complete and accurate AS signatures of tissues and cell types, and to elucidate the regulatory circuitry of AS and its functional implications. Aim 1 will develop a high- performance multi-sample transcript assembly tool, combining subexon graph representations of genes and AS variations, statistical methods for improved feature detection, and search space reduction techniques for efficient sample processing. Aim 2 will build highly efficient and accurate feature selection tools to detect and characterize assembly-free AS variations (subexons and introns), simultaneously from collections of RNA-seq samples. It will combine novel regularized programs with complex models of intronic `noise' and other RNA-seq confounders, and enable analyses of differential splicing and to identify individual and group-specific variations. Lastly, Aim 3 will develop a system to comprehensively model the regulatory and functional circuitry of AS and the effects of mutations, starting from deep learning models of sequences and alignments and integrating expression, sequence, epigenetic and mutation data across tissues, cell types and conditions. We will rigorously test and evaluate all tools in simulations and on large public data sets, as well as on thyroid and head and neck cancer data provided by our collaborators, and we will experimentally validate random subsets of predictions with capillary electrophoresis and qRT-PCR. Collectively, the concepts, methods and tools will establish a new framework for analyzing RNA-seq data that can efficiently tackle the `big data' challenges, leading to more complete discovery and annotation of AS structure and function in human health and disease.   NARRATIVE Alternative splicing is a fundamental gene regulatory mechanism with important roles in human physiology and disease. Next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is making it possible to characterize alternative splicing in great detail, however, current bioinformatics analysis tools miss important variations. The project will design a suite of innovative tools that criss-cross information across multiple RNA-seq samples, and across heterogeneous sequence, epigenetic and expression data, to more comprehensively and more accurately determine the structure, function and regulation of alternative splicing in human biology and disease.",Computational Methods to Characterize Alternative Splicing from Massive Collections of RNA-seq Data,10021689,R01GM129085,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Models', 'Bypass', 'Capillary Electrophoresis', 'Charge', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation Studies', 'Event', 'Farming environment', 'Follicular thyroid carcinoma', 'Galaxy', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Graph', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Human', 'Human Biology', 'Individual', 'International', 'Introns', 'Learning Module', 'Length', 'Methods', 'Methylation', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mutation', 'Noise', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA analysis', 'Regulation', 'Regulator Genes', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spliced Genes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Thyroid carcinoma', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'base', 'cell type', 'cohort', 'data reduction', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feature detection', 'feature selection', 'heterogenous data', 'human disease', 'improved', 'innovation', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'prototype', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'simulation', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly', 'virtual']",NIGMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,363164,-0.023797512513795555

"Analysis of the Molecular Machinery Regulating Gene Expression during Vertebrate Development The maternal to zygotic transition is a fundamental transfer of information conserved among all animals and characterized by a profound change of the transcriptional landscape. Post-transcriptional regulation mediates this drastic change in gene expression through regulatory elements embedded in maternal mRNAs. RNA structure is detrimental to RNA function and regulatory element activity. Coordination of essential biological processes relies on specific RNA structures such as RNA G-quadruplexes-mediated translation in cancer. Therefore, this proposal will address two central questions in biology: what are the components of the code regulating early embryogenesis and what is the role and molecular function of individual components in vertebrate development. New approaches will be used to understand this vital transition. First, high throughput experiments will be performed to identify mRNA elements that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (Aim 1), and to solve their RNA structure (Aim 2). Then, a combination of biochemical and functional approaches will be used to discover the readers of those regulatory elements (Aim 3). Finally, mutants of those readers will be generated and their molecular mechanism and role studied during vertebrate development (Aim 3). Since the interaction between RNA structures and readers are master regulators of key biological phenomenon (e.g. GAIT system in inflammation and roquin in autoimmunity), the novel gene expression regulatory networks uncover in this proposal will likely be conserved in human and impact human development and health. To accomplish this proposal, Dr. Beaudoin will continue his training as Postdoctoral fellow in the Genetics Department at Yale University, where he will enjoy both state-of-the-art facilities and the interaction with his mentors and other scientific leaders in the field. With this K99 Award, Dr. Beaudoin's goals are to get close mentoring from several scientific experts (mentors and collaborators) in mRNA regulation, developmental biology, machine learning and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated functional screens. Furthermore, Dr. Beaudoin plans to expand his previous teaching and mentoring experience by participating in structured courses and workshops. This will allow him to learn innovative and effective ways to teach biology and progress to become a well- rounded scientist and mentor. Dr. Beaudoin existing expertise and the scientific and training plans of this proposal will allow him to reaching his long-term career goal: to establish a research program to understand the role of RNA structures and RNA helicases in vertebrate development. Defective RNA helicases have been associated to dozens of human diseases (e.g. infertility, neurological disorders, cancers and aging). Therefore, their molecular characterization in a relevant vertebrate model will provide invaluable insights to develop new human therapeutic approaches. Dr. Beaudoin is fully committed to obtain an appointment as a tenure track junior faculty in academia. It is fully expected that Dr. Beaudoin will be competitive for such group leader appointments at the completion of his K99/R00 Award tailored to enhance his scientific and mentoring skills.

"Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): RNA is a central molecule in biology, performing a large number of diverse and essential tasks. The diversity of RNA function is conferred, in part, by its ability to adopt many different architectures. This includes the ability to form compactly folded structures that interact with other macromolecules to achieve a biological outcome. The discovery of RNAs with novel functions is accelerating, but our understanding of the diversity of RNA structure and how these structures drive function is not keeping pace. Given the importance of RNA in biology, this is an important knowledge gap. The research program described here focuses on understanding important, diverse, biologically active RNAs produced by viruses. This program is motivated by the fact that many viruses use RNA-based mechanisms to manipulate host cell components, altering cellular conditions to favor infection. Thus, viral RNAs are powerful models to discover new RNA structures, to understand how these structures fold, to examine how they interact with and manipulate other macromolecules, and ultimately to describe how the structure drives a specific function. In addition, by studying how viral RNAs manipulate cellular machines, we learn about the machinery itself and we may find new important fundamental RNA-based cellular processes. Finally, viral disease remains a substantial threat to human health, but for most viral infections there is no effective therapy. Learning how viral RNAs work reveals the molecular basis of virus-induced disease, a necessary understanding for developing needed therapies. The number of unexplored viral RNAs is vast, therefore our strategy is to study a set of model viral RNAs with diverse functions. This includes viral RNAs that manipulate the protein synthesis machinery, RNAs that interfere with or co-opt the function of cellular enzymes, and viral RNAs that mimic cellular RNAs and may be molecular ""hijackers"". For each, we aim to understand the details of their structure-based mechanisms by linking atomic-resolution structural data with the function of these structures within cells. In addition, we are particularly interested in understanding how these RNAs may use programmed conformational dynamics to regulate their function. To achieve this understanding we are using quantitative biochemistry, biophysics, structural biology, and virology in an integrated approach. Our overarching goal is to discover important fundamental rules of RNA-based mechanisms of high impact and with broad applicability to many biological systems, simultaneously characterizing new therapeutic targets to inform the development of treatments for human disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Relevance to NIH Viruses of all sorts are worldwide health threats and the danger of new pandemics continues to rise with increasing human travel and trade. For the vast majority of viruses there are no effective treatments; developing new therapies to target viral disease requires a much greater understanding of the molecular basis of infection and disease. The research program proposed here aims to understand in great detail how structured viral RNAs manipulate host cell machines during infection, and in so doing help create new therapies.","Structure, function, and dynamics of viral RNAs and RNA-containing complexes",9987332,R35GM118070,"['Adopted', 'Architecture', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Complex', 'Disease', 'Enzymes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Infection', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Outcome', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Structure', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biological systems', 'effective therapy', 'human disease', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'pandemic disease', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'structural biology', 'structured data', 'therapy development', 'viral RNA', 'virology']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R35,2020,585552,0.08019005674039666
"Computational Methods for Next-Generation Comparative Genomics PROJECT SUMMARY Recent advances in regulatory genomics, especially 3D genome organization in cell nucleus, suggest that existing methods for cross-species comparisons are limited in their ability to fully understand the evolution of non-coding genome function. In particular, it is known that genomes are compartmentalized to distinct compartments in the nucleus such as nuclear lamina and nuclear speckles. Such nuclear compartmentalization is an essential feature of higher-order genome organization and is linked to various important genome functions such as DNA replication timing and transcription. Unfortunately, to date no study exists that directly compares nuclear compartmentalization between human and other mammals. In addition, there are no computational models available that consider the continuous nature of multiple features of nuclear compartmentalization and function, which is critical to integrate genome-wide functional genomic data and datasets that measure cytological distance to multiple compartments across species. In this project, we will develop novel algorithms and generate new datasets to directly address two key questions: (1) How to identify the evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization? (2) What types of sequence evolution may drive spatial localization changes across species? The proposed project represents the first endeavor in comparative genomics for nuclear compartmentalization. Our Specific Aims are: (1) Developing new probabilistic models for identifying evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization. (2) Identifying genome-wide evolutionary patterns of nuclear compartmentalization in primate species based on TSA-seq and Repli-seq. (3) Developing new algorithms to connect sequence features to nuclear compartmentalization through cross-species comparisons. Successful completion of these aims will result in novel computational tools and new datasets that will be highly valuable for the comparative genomics community. Integrating the new computational tools and unique datasets will provide invaluable insights into the relationship between sequence evolution and changes in nuclear genome organization in mammalian species. Therefore, the proposed research is expected to advance comparative genomics to a new frontier and provide new perspectives for studying human genome function PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because the outcome of the project is expected to enhance the analyses of nuclear genome organizations across primate species to better understand genome function and human biology.

There is no cure for DM1, and the only treatments are palliative. The cause of DM1 is an abnormal CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion (>34 repeats) in the 3′-UTR of DMPK that are transcribed into toxic CUG RNA repeats that accumulate in the nucleus of cells. Toxic CUG repeats sequester Muscleblind Like Splicing Regulator 1 (MBNL1), which is needed for normal splicing of hundreds of key neuromuscular related genes. Studies have shown that small molecules that bind CUG repeats can prevent MBNL1 sequestration and rescue nominal splicing in cells and animal models. However, these small molecules are bulky, very polar, and non-drug-like and therefore suffer from delivery and toxicity issues. Therefore the need remains to identify and optimize drug-like, orally available small molecules that bind CUG repeats and rescue DM1-derived mis-splicing in cells. Preliminary data highlights that the Nymirum platform has identified two classes of drug-like small molecules that can bind CUG repeats and can rescue DM1-derived mis-splicing in HeLa cells. This proposal seeks to go wider and deeper in order to identify and optimize more potent compounds. In Phase I, >2 billion compounds will be rapidly and accurately screened to identify additional classes of chemically diverse drug-like small molecule CUG binders. Those hits will then be optimized at the atomic level using the dynamic CUG structure to guide targeted medicinal chemistry to increase their potency and efficacy in HeLa cells. Phase II will carry out lead-generation in earnest on the hits identified in Phase I. Ultimately, this proposal will develop an orally available small molecule therapeutic to treat DM1. Project Narrative Nymirum is leveraging its platform to develop an orally available small molecule therapeutic that rescues myotonic dystrophy type 1 derived mis-splicing by binding toxic CUG RNA repeats and preventing them from sequestering a key splicing regulator (MBNL1).",Developing Drug-like Small Molecules that Target Toxic Repeat RNAs to Alleviate Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1-derived Mis-Splicing,10135372,R43NS117184,"['Active Learning', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Animal Model', 'Antisense Oligonucleotides', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Bioavailable', 'Biological Assay', 'CUG repeat', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chemicals', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Hela Cells', 'Inherited', 'Insulin Receptor', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental Retardation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Muscle', 'Myotonic Dystrophy', 'Myotonic dystrophy type 1', 'Oral', 'Palliative Care', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pharmaceutical Chemistry', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Protein Kinase', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Splicing', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Transfer RNA', 'Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion', 'Untranslated Regions', 'Visual impairment', 'cognitive disability', 'drug discovery', 'innovation', 'interest', 'muscle degeneration', 'neuromuscular', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rare genetic disorder', 'small molecule', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'success', 'targeted nucleases', 'three dimensional structure', 'virtual']",NINDS,"NYMIRUM, INC.",R43,2020,299267,0.00389316998722466
"RNA Sequencing Via Single Reverse Transcript Assessments Project Summary While very substantial progress has been made over the last 10 or so years with regards to next generation sequencing (NGS) and third generation sequencing (TGS) of DNA, the development of novel and enabling tool sets for RNA sequencing has lagged significantly. During this project, we aim to make significant progress with regards to that gap by developing and validating an entirely new solid-state sequencing platform, developed specifically and ideally for direct RNA sequencing, including its structural complexities and nucleotide modifications, all with high accuracy. While there are over 100 known RNA nucleotide modifications, due to the lack of analytical characterization methods available, the exact roles of these modifications remain to be determined. The technology that will be developed during the project will be capable of elucidating the roles of these modifications, and revolutionizing our understanding and use of the transcriptome/epitranscriptome. Project Narrative A method/technology capable of directly (without transcription) sequencing RNA, with extremely high accuracy and the inherent ability to identify nucleotide modifications, has the potential to revolutionize the use of the transcriptome and epitranscriptome, radically change standard R&D practices, as well as enable revolutionary diagnostics and therapeutics. The entirely new direct RNA sequencing methodology/technology that will be developed during this project will overcome known hurdles and limitation with currently available NGS, TGS, and single-molecule sequencing (SMS) approaches, resulting in technology that is cost efficient, highly accurate, easy-to setup and utilize, capable of de novo sequencing and modified base calling, and capable of producing highly simplistic data for easy analysis and post possessing.",RNA Sequencing Via Single Reverse Transcript Assessments,9961426,R43HG011070,"['Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Caliber', 'Carbon Nanotubes', 'Chemistry', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNA sequencing', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerase', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Drops', 'Electrodes', 'Enzymes', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Geometry', 'Glass', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Inosine', 'Ions', 'Label', 'Length', 'Lipid Bilayers', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Movement', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pseudouridine', 'RNA', 'RNA primers', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase', 'Reader', 'Reading Frames', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Systems Development', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Third Generation Sequencing', 'Time', 'Transcript', 'Transistors', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical diagnostics', 'complex data ', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'electric field', 'epigenomics', 'epitranscriptome', 'epitranscriptomics', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'infancy', 'nanopore', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'programs', 'research and development', 'sequencing platform', 'single molecule', 'solid state', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics']",NHGRI,"ELECTRONIC BIOSCIENCES, INC.",R43,2020,279999,0.04178598830665001
"High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors Accurate modeling of the structure and recognition of adaptive immune receptors is a major challenge in computational biology. Despite a shared immunoglobulin structural framework, highly variable antigen binding loop sequences and structures, with intrinsic dynamics and binding conformational changes, are often not accurately represented or correctly modeled using current algorithms. There is an even greater need to address this challenge due to the rapidly growing field of immune sequencing, which often results in thousands of sequences of antigen-specific immune receptors from the repertoire of a single individual per experiment. In the absence of reliable modeling tools, the observed shared sequence motifs and areas of divergence lack a structural and mechanistic explanation, given that experimental structural characterization is not practical or feasible for more than a handful of molecules. The focus of this application is on T cell receptors (TCRs), which recognize antigenic peptides by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), leading to the cellular immune response. We will develop advanced modeling and design algorithms to address the challenges of flexible loop modeling through informatics and knowledge-based developments to help unravel their recognition code. This will entail the development of algorithms to reliably model TCR structures from sequence (Aim 1), model TCR recognition of peptide-MHCs through docking (Aim 2), and design TCR recognition through loop engineering (Aim 3). These Aims will be accomplished through validation against existing experimental structural and affinity data, as well as close partnership with experimental laboratories that will provide sequence, structural, dynamic, and binding measurements of TCRs, and validate affinity and structure of designed receptors. Collectively, these developments will allow the illumination of the mechanistics underpinning recognition by specific and repertoire-level TCRs from sequence, improved loop modeling and docking algorithms, and the capability to effectively control and engineer TCR recognition through structure-based design. T cell receptors are exceptionally diverse and capable of engaging a broad array of antigens, and are of high interest as therapeutics and in the study of immune response to diseases and viruses. This goal of this project is to generate a robust modeling and design framework to accurately predict structures of T cell receptors from sequence, model antigen recognition, and to design new T cell receptors with desired targeting capabilities, which will be applied to T cell receptors from immune repertoire sequencing efforts and those of medical and therapeutic interest.",High Resolution Modeling and Design of T-Cell Receptors,9939578,R01GM126299,"['Address', 'Affinity', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complementarity Determining Regions', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Engineering', 'Epitopes', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunologic Receptors', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Laboratories', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Motion', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Protein Engineering', 'Protocols documentation', 'Receptor Cell', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'algorithm development', 'antigen binding', 'antigen-specific T cells', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'deep sequencing', 'design', 'engineered T cells', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'immunoglobulin structure', 'improved', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'large datasets', 'model design', 'molecular recognition', 'mutant', 'novel', 'receptor', 'response', 'structured data', 'tool']",NIGMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2020,321599,0.002349650830365011
"Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM PROJECT SUMMARY Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has recently joined X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy as a high-resolution structural method for biological macromolecules. In addition, cryo-EM produces images of individual molecules, and therefore has the potential to resolve conformational changes. The proposal aims to develop new algorithms and software for extending the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing computational tools for cryo-EM. This extension requires solving two of the most challenging computational problems posed by cryo-EM. First, mapping the structural variability of macromolecules is widely recognized as the main computational challenge in cryo-EM. Structural variations are of great significance to biologists, as they provide insight into the functioning of molecular machines. Existing computational tools are limited to a small number of distinct conformations, and therefore are incapable of tackling highly mobile biomolecules with multiple, continuous spectra of conformational changes. The first area of investigation in this project is the development of a computational framework to analyze continuous variability. The proposed approach is based on a new mathematical representation of continuously changing structures and its efficient estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. MCMC algorithms have found great success in many other scientific disciplines, yet they have been mostly overlooked for cryo-EM single particle analysis. Second, a major limiting factor for present cryo-EM studies is the molecule size. Images of small molecules (below ~50kDa) have too little signal to allow existing methods to provide valid 3-D reconstructions. It is commonly believed that cryo-EM cannot be used for molecules that are too small to be reliably detected and picked from micrographs. Challenging that widespread belief, the second area of investigation focuses on developing a groundbreaking approach for reconstructing small molecules directly from micrographs without particle picking. The new approach is based on autocorrelation analysis and completely bypasses particle picking and orientation assignment and requires just one pass over the data. The single-pass approach opens new possibilities for real-time processing during data acquisition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Determining structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, and a first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to significantly increase the power of structure-determination using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Importantly, our methods will broaden the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing techniques.",Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM,9943364,R01GM136780,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Bypass', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Drug Design', 'Fostering', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Ion Channel', 'Ion Pumps', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Machines', 'Molecular Motors', 'Molecular Weight', 'Motion', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Particle Size', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spliceosomes', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data acquisition', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'molecular mass', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,328440,-0.007639483355220309
"Methods for improving clinical diagnostic by detection, prediction, interpretation and prioritization of aberrant transcriptome variations The goal of this research program project is to develop methods to improve clinical diagnosis of children with rare Mendelian disorders. Even with the most advanced standard-of-care genetic test of exome sequencing (ES) diagnostic rate is still below 50%. One reason for this rate is that mutations in non-protein coding regions or those that are synonymous (code for the same protein) are generally discarded even though these could be deleterious due to their effect on the processing of RNA transcribed from the underlying gene. We propose 2 complementary methods to help improve clinical diagnosis: The first is “RNA-first”, where our algorithms suggest which clinically accessible tissue (CAT) to use for RNA sequencing, then compare the results to a larger pool of donors to detect which RNA processing variations may be deleterious. The second is a “DNA-first” approach where we develop “RNA splicing code” models that predict the effect of genetic variations on RNA processing in a given tissue of interest. The two approaches, “RNA-first” and “DNA-first”, will be combined into a clinical diagnostic pipeline at the Children Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) and applied to solve undiagnosed cases at CHOP and other centers, including the NIH’s Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN). Many children who are born with multiple medical issues have a genetic cause for their differences, but even the best tests cannot identify the genetic cause. This project will develop new computer technology to do a more complete analysis of their genetic testing information to help diagnose more of these children.","Methods for improving clinical diagnostic by detection, prediction, interpretation and prioritization of aberrant transcriptome variations",10033447,R01LM013437,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Benchmarking', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'DNA', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Exons', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Human', 'International', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Diagnosis', 'Mutation', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Program Research Project Grants', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Proteins', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Work', 'causal variant', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computational pipelines', 'congenital anomaly', 'deep learning', 'exome', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'heterogenous data', 'improved', 'interest', 'novel', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,347736,-0.004342966375325129
"Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome Detecting protein-RNA interactions is challenging–both experimentally and computationally– because RNA transcripts are large in number, diverse in cellular location and function. As a result, many RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and their cognate motifs are likely unknown or uncharacterized in humans as well as other model organisms. With increasing number of RBPs implicated in human diseases, there is an urgent need for identifying and mapping functional and phenotypic information for RBPs as well as to complete a map of the protein-RNA interaction network. The objective here is to establish a robust computational technique that integrates expression associations with sequence as well as several RBP centric features for genome-scale prediction of binding motifs for hundreds of human RBPs to facilitate the elucidation of their tissue-specific post-transcriptional networks. At the completion of this project, we expect to have developed the most advanced tool for predicting human RBP motifs and methods as well as resources which can facilitate the construction of tissue-specific RBP-RNA networks. Our central hypothesis, supported by our initial genome-scale computational study and assessment by comparative analysis of known RBP binding motifs is that, since many RBPs are involved in different stages of RNA metabolism, exon expression level associations with an RBP and other exon related features can be very powerful in identifying the binding motifs of an RBP in a tissue-specific manner. The proposed integrated approach to experimentally validate several binding motifs using CLIP-seq and to deconvolute global posttranscriptional networks in specific cell/tissue types, using genome-wide data from protein protection assays (POP-seq) will significantly enhance our capability of uncovering network dynamics of RBPs in cell types and tissues. Such high-quality predictions based on experimental validations, resulting from all the Aims which will be made public, can become a venue for future experimental follow up to dissect the role of these important regulatory molecules in different tissues and disease states. The proposed studies will make an impact in the field as the first large-scale computational mapping of protein-RNA interaction networks in the human tissues by taking our ability to predict RBP targets to the next level. The complementary experience and expertise of investigators will make this project successful. RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in every biological pathway and cellular process. Elucidation of the RNA recognition motifs of hundreds of RNA-binding proteins discovered in recent years and analysis of dynamic post-transcriptional networks of RBPs across various tissues and disease states will increase our fundamental knowledge about how gene expression is modulated by these important regulatory molecules in living organisms. This knowledge is a critical step towards understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of several human diseases caused by mutation or mis-expression of these proteins.",Mapping RNA protein interaction networks in the human genome,9995511,R01GM123314,"['AIDS/HIV problem', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Exons', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'HepG2', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'K-562', 'K562 Cells', 'Knowledge', 'Liver', 'Location', 'MALAT1 gene', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Protein Binding Domain', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'RNA Binding', 'RNA Recognition Motif', 'RNA metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'RNA-Protein Interaction', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Ribonucleoproteins', 'Role', 'Running', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Validation', 'base', 'bioinformatics tool', 'cell type', 'comparative', 'computer framework', 'computer studies', 'computing resources', 'crosslinking and immunoprecipitation sequencing', 'deep sequencing', 'differential expression', 'disease-causing mutation', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'genome-wide', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'online resource', 'predictive tools', 'protein expression', 'protein profiling', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2020,302789,0.005703529489897519
"Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads Project Summary RNA modifications are pervasive throughout the human transcriptome and affect transcript stability, localization, and function. In particular, ADAR-mediated adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) edits in RNA have been shown to affect pre-mRNA splicing and alter codon sequence. Amino acid changes caused by inosines have been implicated in various deleterious conditions, which include cancer and diseases of the brain. However, previous literature mapping inosine positions in high-throughput were only able to do so inside the limited context provided by short RNA-Seq reads. As modifications can be transcript-specific, elucidating the association of inosines with full mRNA isoforms is crucial for a more rigorous understanding of the role of inosine modifications in the tissues of our body and, more broadly, disease. Therefore, I propose to investiate A-to-I editing in the context of diseased and non-diseased systems using full-length mRNA nanopore sequencing. The nanopore is able to sequence whole RNA strands by converting changes in electrical current caused by RNA translocating through the pore into nucleotide sequence. ​Aim 1 leverages high-accuracy nanopore cDNA sequencing of cellular systems with and without ADAR knockdown to interrogate ADAR function and A-to-I-induced changes to transcript expression changes. To accomplish the latter, I will develop workflows to determine isoform structure from noisy, long reads. In addition to sequencing full-length transcripts, nanopore native RNA (nvRNA) sequencing informs on RNA modifications, as modified nucleotides appear as subtle alteration in current signal with respect to canonical nucleotides. As such, ​Aim 2 ​employs a generalizable approach to producing cost-effective training data for systematically understanding how inosines alter current signals in nanopores. I will use a Cas13b-ADAR fusion protein (REPAIRv2) to create site-specific edits and then perform nvRNA sequencing on the edited transcriptome. Site-specific A-to-I editing allows this approach to create a labelled inosine dataset in nvRNA signal from which I can develop computational algorithms to reliably identify inosines in nvRNA data. The REPAIRv2 approach to can be generalized to eventually identify any RNA modification with nanopores. ​Aim 3 will elucidate how A-to-I editing differs between tissues. I will sequence 4 normal tissue types with nvRNA sequencing, generating a map of A-to-I edits in conjunction with isoform usage using the software I am developing. Taken together, the fulfillment of these aims will not only provide further insights on elusive ADAR mechanism, but also create workflows for nanopore data analysis and a platform for the study of any modification. As I work toward my Ph.D. with this interdisciplinary project, I will gain invaluable skills in experimental and computational biology that will prepare me for a career in science. Project Narrative Understanding the functional outcomes of adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing in greater depth is crucial to understanding cancer, diseases of the brain, and other deleterious effects that arise from modification misregulation. To study inosines in full-length mRNA contexts, we will use nanopore sequencing to generate a map of A-to-I editing in diseased and non-diseased transcriptomes. The objective of this proposal is to develop the experimental and computational requisites for identifying inosine modifications in nanopore native RNA sequencing data, particularly for illuminating the interplay between A-to-I editing, alternative splicing, and mRNA regulation.",Platform for transcriptome-wide RNA modification identification in long reads,9912024,F31HG010999,"['Address', 'Adenosine', 'Affect', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acids', 'Atlases', 'Base Sequence', 'Benchmarking', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Breast', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Chimeric Proteins', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Complementary DNA', 'Computational Biology', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enzymes', 'Exons', 'Functional disorder', 'Guanosine', 'Human', 'Inosine', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Length', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Lung', 'Lung Adenocarcinoma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Motor Neurons', 'Neurons', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Poly(A) Tail', 'Polyadenylation', 'Polymerase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Property', 'Protein Isoforms', 'RNA', 'RNA Editing', 'RNA Processing', 'RNA Splicing', 'Regulation', 'Research Personnel', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Role', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Work', 'adenosine deaminase', 'base', 'career', 'computer framework', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'functional outcomes', 'human tissue', 'insight', 'knock-down', 'mRNA Precursor', 'machine learning method', 'nanopore', 'neuron loss', 'skills', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA CRUZ,F31,2020,38613,0.05259996572683358
