"Identifying optimal dynamic strategies for prostate cancer control PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Big Data has the potential to revolutionize cancer research and care, but extracting the information it holds on the optimal strategies for cancer control will require cutting-edge tools in data science. The optimal strategies for cancer control will be dynamic strategies that adapt clinical decisions over time to a patient’s evolving clinical history. Unfortunately, conventional statistical methods cannot appropriately compare dynamic strategies, so we need methods specifically designed for this task: g-methods. G-methods have helped to shape clinical care in many areas, but they have not been systematically applied to cancer research. Further, while g-methods let us validly estimate the effect of pre-specified strategies, these may not be the optimal strategies. My overarching goal is to apply and further develop analytic methods to learn the optimal strategies for cancer control from complex longitudinal data and generate user-friendly, publicly-available software to make these methods available to the cancer research community. I will apply these methods to answer key clinical questions across the prostate cancer control continuum: 1) the optimal dietary and lifestyle strategies to prevent aggressive prostate cancer, 2) the optimal screening strategy following a baseline PSA test to maximize detection of aggressive disease while minimizing detection of indolent tumors, and 3) the optimal statin therapy strategy to maximize survival among men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. This project will leverage data from a large prospective cohort study and a novel platform of electronic health records linked with genetic data. I will first apply g-methods to estimate the effects of recommended strategies for cancer control that a randomized trial would have limited feasibility to evaluate. I will then investigate whether novel methods that learn the optimal strategies from the data may lead to improved, targeted recommendations that get the right interventions to the right people at the right time. This innovative project will advance comparative effectiveness research for cancer care at the cutting edge of data science. I am optimally positioned to undertake this research based on my 1) expertise in cancer, epidemiology, and causal inference; 2) exceptional multidisciplinary mentoring team comprised of global leaders in their respective fields; and 3) unparalleled research environment to support my career development. Through this work, I will expand my expertise in new areas, including machine learning. The proposed research and training will help me achieve my long-term career goal to become an independent investigator and lead a transdisciplinary research program that integrates causal inference and machine learning to identify optimal strategies for cancer control. Leveraging rich, existing data, this proposal represents a significant opportunity to develop, apply, and disseminate powerful methods for big clinical data to accelerate progress in cancer research and care. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will answer key clinical questions about the optimal strategies for prostate cancer prevention, detection, and treatment by applying innovative analytic methods to complex longitudinal data. This research will result in the development, application, and dissemination of powerful methods for big clinical data that accelerate progress in cancer research and care.",Identifying optimal dynamic strategies for prostate cancer control,10162559,K99CA248335,"['Area', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Cancer Control', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Indolent', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Nonmetastatic', 'PSA screening', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Screening Result', 'Shapes', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Statistical Methods', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer care', 'cancer epidemiology', 'cancer prevention', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision-making', 'comorbidity', 'cost effective', 'design', 'dietary', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'longitudinal database', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'open source', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prostate cancer prevention', 'randomized trial', 'screening', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K99,2021,120038,146629556
"Content-based MR-TRUS Fusion without Tracking There are about 3 million American men living with prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States. If the prostate cancer is caught early before it spreads to other parts of the body, by active monitoring or treatment, most men will not die from it. Nevertheless, 22% to 47% of the patients with negative biopsies but elevated prostate-specific antigen levels may still harbor malignant tumors, which can be life threatening and could have been missed by the commonly used ultrasound guided random biopsy. By contrast, fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted biopsies has shown to significantly improve the cancer detection rate. However, MR-TRUS fusion itself is very challenging due to the difficulties in directly registering images of these two very different modalities in different dimensions. To bypass the difficult registration problems, the existing fusion techniques require the use of specialized expensive and cumbersome hardware tracking devices, which increases cost and elongates procedures. More importantly, due to a number of factors such as patient movement, respiratory motion and ultrasound transducer pressure change, prostate motion can happen during a procedure and cause the images to be misaligned. Timely noticing and correcting such motion require great skill and knowledge of radiological imaging, where studies show a steep learning curve for mastering fusion systems. Failing in image registration and motion compensation renders the fusion guided biopsy performing no differently than random biopsy. To address the fundamental cause of the problems, the goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR- TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices. The proposed research is foundational for developing next generation of MR-TRUS fusion guidance systems for prostate biopsy to achieve robust performance with lower costs. Recent advancement in machine learning, especially deep learning, has provided us new tools and new angles to tackle this challenging problem. This project aims for directly fusing 2D TRUS frames with 3D MR volume by developing novel deep learning methods for image reconstruction and registration. The proposed methods are designed to exploit both population and patient specific imaging information to accurately align images. As all learning-based image registration methods try to better use population knowledge to improve the registration performance, few of them have been able to efficiently use patient specific information, which can be essential to obtain robust and accurate performance. Upon successful completion, the innovation created from the project will disrupt the common perception that hardware tracking has to be used for multimodal image fusion-guided interventions and alleviate the demand on physicians’ experience and skill in image analysis and fusion to help obtain consistent results. This project will lead to the development of novel prostate biopsy systems and will also impact a range of other image fusion based interventional guidance technologies. Fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted prostate biopsies can significantly improve the detection of aggressive cancer.

"Low-Field High-Performance MRI for Screening Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer Project Summary/Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy and is the 2nd leading cause of cancer-related mortality in males in the United States. Despite high incidence and tremendous human and economic impact of PCa, there is no good screening test for clinically significant PCa. Commonly used blood test for Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) is inexpensive but lack specificity for clinically significant PCa. Over the last decade, multi- parametric prostate MRI has been shown to have an increasingly important role in the detection and localization of clinically significant PCa. Despite the demonstrated value of prostate MRI, there are two major challenges in clinical implementation of prostate MRI as a first-line screening tool at a population level: (1) high cost of the scanner and the exam, which decreases accessibility, and (2) lack of robustness of the MRI exam. To overcome these limitations we propose establishing a low-field, robust, widely accessible, and thus low- cost high-performance MRI system for PCa screening. Major challenges for imaging at lower field strength is the lower signal to noise (SNR) and thus longer acquisition times compared to 1.5 and 3.0 T. In this proposal we aim to address these efficiency and scan time challenges at low field. Our team of clinical and imaging scientists will bring to bear novel acquisition and reconstruction techniques to restore SNR, specifically random matrix theory (RMT- a technique our center has recently introduced), and deep-learning- based image reconstruction (an area our group has helped to pioneer). We will evaluate these techniques in healthy volunteers and patients with PCa. Subsequently, we will perform head-to-head comparison of low-field bi-parametric exam to routine clinical 1.5 T or 3.0 T MRI exams in 30 patients with known or suspected PCa. Project Narrative Although Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer- related mortality in men in the U.S., there is a lack of a good screening test for clinically significant PCa. Multi- parametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays an increasingly important role in detecting and localizing clinically significant PCa, but cost and accessibility of conventional MRI limits its use as a first-line screening test. Therefore, we propose establishing a low-field, robust, accessible, and thus low-cost, high- performance MRI methodology for screening clinically significant PCa.",Low-Field High-Performance MRI for Screening Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer,10111669,R21CA256324,"['Acoustics', 'Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'American Cancer Society', 'Amplifiers', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Evaluation', 'Fellowship', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Helium', 'Hip region structure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Intestines', 'Literature', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Ownership', 'PSA screening', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Ursidae Family', 'aged', 'base', 'cancer care', 'clinical implementation', 'clinically significant', 'contrast enhanced', 'cost', 'cost estimate', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'design', 'economic impact', 'head-to-head comparison', 'healthy volunteer', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging scientist', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'light weight', 'male', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'operation', 'prostate lesions', 'prototype', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'theories', 'volunteer']",NCI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2021,237724,329565273
"Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown that delivery of higher radiation doses to the prostate results in improved tumor control rates in prostate cancer radiation therapy (RT). As local recurrence mostly occurs at the primary tumor, particularly for high-risk patients, additional dose escalation is expected to improve the treatment outcome. However, the application of dose escalation for prostate RT is greatly limited by the tolerance of nearby healthy tissues that cannot adequately be excluded from the radiation field. This limitation can be overcome by dose painting, where a higher dose is applied to the prostate tumor only instead of the whole prostate gland. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) offers reduced treatment time, convenience, and possibly increased treatment efficacy as compared to the conventionally fraction scheme. UTSW is currently conducting a dose escalation trial using SBRT for high-risk prostate cancer patients with an integrated dose boost on MRI-visualized prostate tumor. However, prostate can move and deform during the beam delivery. To ensure the escalated dose is actually delivered to tumor regions as planned, a reliable tumor tracking method is urgently needed. While intra-prostatic tumors can be identified by multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) for treatment planning, intrafraction tumor tracking during the beam delivery is not achievable with mpMRI. In contrast, ultrasound offers a cost-effective and real-time imaging with high soft tissue contrast. However, conventional ultrasound techniques only provide anatomic structure of the prostate gland without the capability to differentiate tumor region from the rest of the prostate gland. Temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) has emerged as a new paradigm for prostate tissue characterization by analyzing the time-series ultrasound images with advanced machine learning techniques. In this project, we aim to develop, optimize and evaluate an innovative TeUS based intra-prostatic tumor tracking method to guide SBRT with an integrated dose boost for high-risk prostate cancer patients. The specific aims are: 1) Develop TeUS-based intra-prostatic tumor delineation for guiding focused dose escalation; 2) Integrate and validate TeUS-based tumor tracking system during SBRT; and 3) Evaluate clinical gain of TeUS guided SBRT for high risk prostate cancer patients. Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the development and validation of a low-cost yet highly accurate TeUS guided system for targeted prostate cancer RT. With enhanced real-time visualization of tumor, the use of TeUS for RT guidance will lead to better treatment efficacy and reduced toxicity. Delivery of higher radiation doses to the tumor region can improve outcome of radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer patients. As the prostate can move and deform during radiation beam delivery, there is an urgent need for a reliable method to ensure escalated dose is delivered to the tumor region as planned. We will develop, integrate and evaluate a novel prostate tumor tracking method based on temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) to guide radiation therapy for high-risk patients, which will lead to higher local control with improved toxicity.",Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT,10107816,R01EB027898,"['Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Probability', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Prostatic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapy trial', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'advanced prostate cancer', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'early phase trial', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate cancer risk', 'prostate lesions', 'real-time images', 'soft tissue', 'standard care', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'vibration']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,344156,225463847
"High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy Project Summary: In prostate cancer (PCa), the presence and amount of residual tumor at the surface of the excised prostate is the only prognostic factor that is affected by surgical technique, vs. other factors, which are fixed and non-modifiable. Yet, positive surgical margins (PSM), defined as the presence of tumor cells at the inked surface of the removed specimen, are common, especially in advanced stage cancers, and are a strong independent risk factor for clinical progression and secondary treatment. In addition, elevated post-operative PSA, which is understood to be related to tumor left behind in the patient, is also associated with high risk of progression and secondary treatment. Thus, complete tumor removal is important to achieve to improve  patient outcomes and reduce overtreatment, yet there is a delicate balance between resection radicality and  minimizing damage to the neurovascular bundles to preserve post-operative function. The NeuroSAFE trial demonstrated that real-time detection and correction of PSMs by comprehensive histology of the prostate  circumference results in improved patient outcomes, yet there are no widely adoptable methods to achieve this. In an effort to address this technical gap, we have developed video-rate structured illumination microscopy (VR-SIM) and demonstrated that it enables accurate diagnosis of PCa in the biopsy setting, and that it can  rapidly deliver gigapixel microscopic images of the entire prostate surface for detection of PSMs. VR-SIM delivers the surface area coverage and resolution needed to detect PSMs, yet it is also fast and relatively simple and inexpensive, opening the possibility for widespread adoption. In this project, our interdisciplinary team of  engineers and clinicians with significant prostate expertise will further advance this technology towards clinical translation, by completing critical technology development steps and by prospectively validating it in a large patient series. Specifically, we will increase the mechanical automation speed of the device, and will develop a fully automated system for handling of the removed prostate, to enable gigapixel panoramas of the entire  prostate circumferential surface to be delivered within 10 minutes of removal and with minimal tissue processing and user intervention. We will then leverage our recently developed dual-color fluorescent stain that replicates standard H&E with high specificity, to develop expert-validated clinical image atlases using biopsies and  cadaveric specimens to enhance image interpretation of VR-SIM prostate panoramas. These improvements will be combined to test the system in a prospective 250-patient clinical study, to determine the accuracy of the device for intra-operative detection of PSMs and prediction of post-operative PSA based on measurement of PSM extent. Finally, we will measure and model expert reviewer behavior using a novel web-enabled visual observer tracking method, which could be used in future computer-assisted search algorithms to expedite  intra-operative image review. Successful completion will set the stage for multi-center clinical trials to validate the clinical utility of VR-SIM for real-time detection and correction of PSMs, and improvement of patient outcomes. Project Narrative: Achieving complete tumor removal in prostate cancer is an important goal to achieve because leaving tumor behind in the patient contributes to increased risk of cancer progression and need for additional harmful treatment. Yet, it is difficult to determine in real-time if surgery is successful due to the lack of available technologies for intra-operative guidance. This project will develop a rapid scanner that will automatically scan the entire prostate surface for residual tumor within 10 minutes of removal, providing images which are readily interpreted by trained pathologists and enabling real-time guidance of nerve-sparing prostate cancer surgery.",High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy,10172866,R01CA222831,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Case Series', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Computer Assisted', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Frozen Sections', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Ink', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nerve', 'Online Systems', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Prostate', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surface of the Prostate', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analog', 'authority', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'cancer surgery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computer aided detection', 'contrast imaging', 'diagnostic technologies', 'high risk', 'histological image', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'microscopic imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neurovascular', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate surgery', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'technology development', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'visual search', 'web-enabled']",NCI,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2021,397823,92601146
"Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam Abstract Non-invasive, multi-parametric characterization of prostate cancer (PC), with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, is an active area of research with great potential for providing improved diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The PI-RADSv2 assessment system that was established by an international team of experts recognizes the value of quantitative images in PC diagnosis, but relies largely on qualitative evaluation of weighted images. Although this grading approach achieves reasonably good separation be- tween normal and abnormal prostate tissue, it does not achieve adequate separation between indolent and aggressive disease, with the risk that more unnecessary and costly surgery is performed with poten- tially dire consequences on patient quality of life. High-value protocols, without need for an invasive and costly endo-rectal radio-frequency coil are being investigated. This comes at the cost of extended scan time and reduced image quality in terms of spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and signal bias, which negatively impacts sensitivity and speciﬁcity of multi-parametric MRI. With the pronounced increase of multi-parametric MRI exams, there is also the desire to integrate the support by the most recent revolution in diagnostic imaging, i.e., machine learning. It becomes increasingly clear, that in order to avoid having to train neural networks for each speciﬁc system and protocol, reproducible and thus preferably quantitative imaging protocols are essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose both pulse sequence develop- ment, investigation of ADC validity and reproducibility and novel post-processing strategies. The overall objective is to demonstrate the added value of lesion characterization with quantitative values and at the same time understand and minimize the inﬂuence of protocol choices and scan hardware, hence improve overall reproducibility. Speciﬁc Aim 1 will focus on the development of a low distortion MR imaging sequence for rapid concurrent quantiﬁcation of T2 and diﬀusion signal decay. Speciﬁc Aim 2 will examine ADC variations that result from changes in diﬀusion time over a range that is typical with present day clinical MR systems. Speciﬁc Aim 3 introduces advanced handling of low noise diﬀusion data, which will be indispensable for achieving high accuracy and precision with non-invasive and economic external coils. Speciﬁc Aim 4 introduces a novel ADC computation approach that fully captures the complex diﬀusion signal decays in tissues and at the same time is largely protocol and system independent. Moreover, re- sulting images and quantitative maps processed according this approach, exhibit considerably lower noise, which can be traded for higher spatial resolution or shorter scan duration. In combination, the consis- tently quantitative nature of the data and its ubiquitous validity and comparability will greatly facilitate the establishment of recommendations for disease-related thresholds. Ultimately this may permit much more reliable diﬀerentiation of aggressive from indolent disease. Project Narrative Magnetic resonance imaging plays an important role for staging of prostate cancer. We propose advances that permit quantitative and a more reliable assessment of prostate cancer. Potentially this will permit better diﬀerentiation of disease that is aggressive from disease that poses low risk of spreading.",Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam,10115670,R01CA241817,"['Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Fingerprint', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recommendation', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'cancer diagnosis', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'method development', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'quantitative imaging', 'radio frequency', 'rectal']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,452748,327644200
"OpenIGTLink: a network communication interface for closed-loop image-guided interventions Project Summary/Abstract In this cycle of the project, we will extend OpenIGTLink software to enable individualized precision guidance, where patient-specific characteristics are taken into account in the planning and control process for image- guided robotic interventions (IGRI) to achieve a better clinical outcome. In particular, we will focus on improving needle placement accuracy for IGRI of the prostate, as a simple, and yet a representative application of individualized precision guidance. Percutaneous needle placement plays a fundamental role in both the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer. Nearly one million prostate biopsies are performed annually in the United States, where tissues are sampled from the prostate with a biopsy needle for pathological examination. The confirmed lesions may then be focally treated with brachytherapy or thermal ablation using applicator needles depending on clinical indications and patient preference. For those procedures, accurate needle placement is essential to avoid false-negatives or ensure an optimal dose distribution. The demand for accurate needle placement is growing in recent years, as clinicians are now capable of pinpointing subregions in a heterogeneous tumor thanks to the recent progress in imaging technologies, particularly multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the in vivo accuracies achieved by previous studies have never matched the level of tumor subregion targeting due to needle deviation as a result of physical interaction between the needle and the heterogeneous tissue. To address this issue, we will incorporate needle deviation models in an IGRI system using OpenIGTLink software. Our hypothesis is that the models adapted to individual patients will enable avoidance or compensation of needle deviation, leading to an improved in vivo needle placement accuracy. The project comprises the following four specific aims: (Aim 1) Develop a biomechanical model with image-based semi-automatic model generation; (Aim 2) Develop a data-driven prediction model and hybridize with the biomechanical model; (Aim 3) Extend the IGRI platform for model- based closed-loop control using OpenIGTLink; (Aim 4) Evaluate biomechanical, data-driven, and hybrid models in vivo needle placement. Project Narrative Percutaneous needle placement plays a fundamental role in biopsy and focal ablation of prostate cancer. The goal of this project is to develop and disseminate free open-source software named OpenIGTLink to support advanced image-guided robot-assisted systems, where a robotic system guides a needle into the prostate based on biomechanical, data-driven, and hybrid models that predict the tissue and needle deformation in the patient during insertion. We expect that the accurate prediction will enable individualized planning and control for robot-assisted needle placement and improve accuracy biopsy and focal ablation.",OpenIGTLink: a network communication interface for closed-loop image-guided interventions,10211359,R01EB020667,"['Ablation', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Biomechanics', 'Biopsy', 'Brachytherapy', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Financial compensation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Needles', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Ablation', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Robotics', 'Role', 'Structure of base of prostate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thermal Ablation Therapy', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'clinical practice', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo Model', 'individual patient', 'open source', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'prostate biopsy', 'real-time images', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'robotic system', 'simulation', 'software development', 'tumor']",NIBIB,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,701392,327644200
"Integrated radiomic and liquid biopsy monitoring in SWOG S1802: A phase 3 therapeutic trial for metastatic prostate cancer Abstract Prostate cancer (PC) afflicts more men in the U.S. than any other malignancy and is the second leading cause of cancer death in this population. Recently, new therapies have improved survival in some men but have offered little benefit to others. Tissue profiling has identified genes and pathways associated with resistance and progression to advanced disease, but little is known about the dynamics of when and how such changes arise during therapy. Such insights can only be gained through minimally invasive monitoring that allows repeated disease profiling over time. Our multidisciplinary team has developed and tested two such minimally invasive monitoring capabilities: The first is multi-parametric liquid biopsy: streamlined analysis of blood samples that simultaneously measures PC-relevant cellular and molecular features from single circulating tumor cells and matched plasma cell-free nucleic acids. The second is radiomic analysis: high-throughput extraction of quantitative metrics to identify PC-relevant phenomic imaging features. By synergizing the strengths of the two methods, our goal is to test the hypothesis that liquid biopsy and radiomic techniques can be applied jointly to monitor metastatic PC noninvasively over time, culminating in new prognostic and predictive tools to guide therapy. To maximize the impact of our findings, liquid biopsy profiling and radiomic analysis will be integrated into Southwest Oncology (SWOG) S1802, a phase 3 prospective therapeutic trial for over 1200 men with newly diagnosed metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer (mCSPC) treated with standard systemic therapy alone or in combination with definitive treatment of the primary tumor. Notably, SWOG and the other participating cooperative groups have reviewed and approved this proposal (see Letters of Support), and the requisite blood samples and CT scans already are being collected as part of the active protocol. In this unique setting, we will pursue three Specific Aims. We will: 1. Use multi-parametric liquid biopsies to monitor the evolving cellular and molecular landscape of mCSPC during treatment in S1802; 2. Use radiomic analysis of CT scans to monitor the evolving radiographic landscape of mCSPC during treatment in S1802; and 3. Integrate cellular, molecular, and radiomic data to develop composite disease monitoring models predictive of PFS and OS. Importantly, liquid biopsies and CT images will be matched within patients and analyzed at key inflection points over the course of the trial: at diagnosis, after initiation of systemic therapy, after definitive therapy, and at disease progression. In this way, the proposed work will illuminate when and how PC-relevant phenotypes arise during therapy, and how they relate to clinical outcomes. In particular, we will better understand which components of the liquid biopsy – circulating cells, plasma, or both – most accurately reflect the tumor's evolving molecular profile, which radiomic metrics most closely correlate with these molecular features and can serve as early cost-effective indicators of emerging resistance, and which composite models combining liquid biopsy and radiomic features best predict PFS and OS and can serve as powerful minimally-invasive tools to monitor and adjust therapy. Project Narrative Prostate cancer is the most common and second most lethal malignancy in U.S. men, and better tools are needed to monitor disease and guide therapy. We propose to combine analysis of liquid biopsies (peripheral blood samples) with quantified evaluation of CT scans to monitor disease over time in a phase 3 multi-center clinical trial for men with metastatic prostate cancer. By integrating these modalities and the data we generate from them in a large prospective cohort, we will develop and validate new minimally invasive signatures of disease response and resistance that predict survival and can be used to monitor and optimize treatment in real time.",Integrated radiomic and liquid biopsy monitoring in SWOG S1802: A phase 3 therapeutic trial for metastatic prostate cancer,10154662,R01CA257610,"['Abdomen', 'Address', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Enrollment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Metastatic Prostate Cancer', 'Metastatic to', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Plasma Cells', 'Population', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Prospective cohort', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Radiation Oncology', 'Randomized', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Site', 'Synaptophysin', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Trials', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'genomic biomarker', 'high throughput analysis', 'image processing', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'insight', 'liquid biopsy', 'men', 'minimally invasive', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'peripheral blood', 'phase III trial', 'phenomics', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive signature', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic signature', 'prognostic tool', 'prospective', 'radiomics', 'response', 'sample collection', 'survival prediction', 'targeted sequencing', 'therapy resistant', 'tool', 'treatment optimization', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,706071,324592664
"Pathomic Predictors of Prostate Cancer Progression Abstract  Recent studies suggest that in the U.S. prostate cancer is over-detected and over-treated resulting in significant morbidity and financial costs. These problems are the product of poor sensitivity and specificity serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) as a screening tool, leading to unnecessary biopsies that find small and predominantly indolent prostate tumors. While many prostate cancers should be managed with active surveillance, uncertainties surrounding available clinical tools of aggressiveness (such as PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage) will often drive patients and physicians to treatment. Attempts to improve prognostication using candidate biomarkers, mostly discovered from genomic analyses of large pieces of cancers, have had few successes, and available molecular tools provide only modest prediction, at best. An alternative to the genomic driver focus is that a combination of molecular events, under the influence of the tumor microenvironment, drive tumor’s molecular evolution and progression. Consequently, analysis of tumor characteristics detectable in pathomic data, such as heterogeneity of expression subtypes, amount of stroma, extent of microenvironmental heterogeneity, extent of immune infiltration, or extent of hypoxia, may ultimately lead to better patient stratification. Our proposal fundamentally centers around the most critical clinical question in early prostate cancer that is the basis for clinical decision making: Can we identify proteomic, imaging, and/or microenvironment features that distinguish those aggressive cancers that will progress to cause harm from benign cancers that can be safely monitored by watchful waiting?  To examine the links between the heterogeneity of early, screen-detected prostate cancers and likelihood of progression, we will interrogate a retrospective set of 225 prostatectomy patients. In Aim 1, we will use GE’s hyperplexed immune-pathology platform (Cell DIVE) to profile over 50 proteins at the cellular and subcellular level along with matrix components that define the microenvironments with the cells present in this matrix. In Aim 2, we will focus on single-cell level data and systematically extract the prevalence of the diverse cell subtypes found within these tumors. Cells will be typed along traditional axes (e.g. epithelial, CD4+ T-cells). In addition, we will use molecular and structural characteristics to define novel subtypes. Features associated with cell types (e.g. existence, prevalence, diversity) will be used alone and in combination with Gleason grading to distinguish patients with aggressive tumors that are likely to progress. Aim 3 will focus on neighborhood and regional analyses, particularly on developing approaches to extract tumor microenvironmental characteristics that have demonstrated linkages to progression (hypoxia, stromal reactivity, immune cell patterning). Using a diverse set of these features, alongside deep learning techniques on primary images, we will develop classifiers distinguishing aggressive and benign tumors. Finally, in Aim 4 we will validate classifiers in large cohorts. Project Narrative  Our proposal fundamentally centers around the most critical clinical question in early prostate cancer that is the basis for clinical decision making; namely, can we identify proteomic, imaging, and/or microenvironment features that distinguish those aggressive cancers that will progress to cause harm from benign cancers that can be safely monitored by watchful waiting?",Pathomic Predictors of Prostate Cancer Progression,10146314,R01CA249899,"['Apoptosis', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial', 'Event', 'Financial cost', 'Formalin', 'Genomics', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'In Situ', 'Indolent', 'Infiltration', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'PI3K/AKT', 'PSA screening', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Pathway', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Uncertainty', 'adverse outcome', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer care', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'early screening', 'ethnic diversity', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'molecular pathology', 'molecular phenotype', 'molecular subtypes', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'prostate cancer progression', 'serum PSA', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor hypoxia', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,795107,560644462
