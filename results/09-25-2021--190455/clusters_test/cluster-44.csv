"Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure The overarching goal of this project is to improve care for patients with heart failure (HF). HF, whether with reduced (HFrEF) or preserved (HFpEF) ejection fraction, is associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and cost. In the U.S. alone, HF affects over 5 million adults, and the prevalence is projected to exceed 8 million by 2030. HF is the most frequent cause of hospitalization among Medicare recipients and results in over $30 billion in health care expenditures each year. Advances in management, especially for HFrEF, have modestly reduced death rates over time, but mortality continues to be high, with approximately half of patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis. Moreover, the pace of drug discovery has been slow, and there are no proven therapies for patients suffering with HFpEF. Among patients with established HF there is substantial variation in illness severity, degree of cardiac remodeling, disease progression, and response to therapy. These observations highlight the heterogeneity of the HF syndrome and suggest existence of subtypes with differing clinical and potentially genetic profiles, with subsequent differences in downstream disease mechanisms, overall risk, and therapeutic response. However, the understanding of the phenotypic, genetic, and pathophysiological heterogeneity of HF is incomplete. This project investigates the phenotypic substructure and genetic architecture of HF by leveraging a unique collection of interrelated datasets from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC), including the de- identified electronic health record (EHR) and BioVU, a linked DNA biobank. The EHR contains ~2.6 million patients, including ~35,000 with HF, and BioVU currently houses >225,000 DNA samples. Dense genotype data are available in >28,000 subjects and an institutional genotyping project will increase this to >125,000 by mid- 2017; this includes >13,000 subjects with HF. The proposed research will: 1) identify HF subtypes from dense clinical data alone using advanced, unbiased, deep learning algorithms (Aim 1), 2) define the genetic architecture of HF and HF subtypes by using inferred gene expression, general linear mixed models, genetic risk scores, and traditional association testing to quantify heritability of and genetic correlations among HF subtypes, define the contribution of established risk factors to HF subtypes, and 3) discover subtype-specific genetic risk factors (Aim 2), and discover HF subtype-specific clinical outcomes, disease associations, and drug response phenotypes using advanced phenome scanning and network analysis (Aim 3). Heart failure (HF) is a complex, debilitating syndrome associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The heterogeneity of HF has limited success of prior efforts to understand HF pathobiology and develop effective interventions. By defining clinical and genetic modifiers of HF risk, disease course, and treatment response for clinically recognized and novel, data-driven HF subtypes, results from this work could result in a more sophisticated HF classification system based on underlying biology, and ultimately facilitate precision risk stratification, tailoring of therapeutic strategies, and rational HF clinical trials.",Genomic and Phenomic Architecture of Heart Failure,10076848,R01HL140074,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'EFRAC', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Heart failure', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severity of illness', 'Subgroup', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'defined contribution', 'disease phenotype', 'drug discovery', 'effective intervention', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'preservation', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'success', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,395000
"Personalizing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are guideline- recommended therapies for preventing end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in patients with CKD. However, in real-world practice, ACEIs/ARBs are frequently discontinued by providers in the setting of acute kidney injury (AKI), rapid declines in kidney function, or advanced CKD. Premature discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs can lead to adverse clinical outcomes among patients with CKD. However, discontinuation of these agents may be appropriate for certain CKD subgroups who are at higher risk of AKI and who may derive less benefit from these agents than trial populations. Although guidelines support the use of ACEIs/ARBs in patients with CKD, they also allow for individualization of decisions surrounding their use. However, it is unclear how to best individualize these decisions as CKD progresses to optimize kidney and cardiovascular outcomes. The overall objective of this proposal is to personalize ACEI/ARB therapy for patients with CKD based on each individual's risk factors for ESKD and CVD. To accomplish this, we will use data from the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study. We will first identify factors that drive the discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs (Aim 1). Next, we will build two clinical tools that model the relationship between ACEI/ARB discontinuation and risk of ESKD (Aim 2) or CVD events (Aim 3) in individuals with CKD. Our long-term goal is to reduce the burden of kidney disease and improve patient outcomes by individualizing medication use in CKD. We expect that completion of these aims will result in the development of two prediction tools that can be further refined and implemented in real-world clinical practice as part of a career development award application. The proposed aims are integrated into a comprehensive training plan that includes a Master's Degree in Clinical Research and practical mentored experiences. Through this training plan, Dr. Chen will have the opportunity to 1) learn and apply knowledge in advanced biostatistical and epidemiological methods, including marginal structural modeling; 2) gain familiarity with the CRIC Study database, 3) apply machine learning algorithms to the development of clinical prediction tools, 4) refine skills in scientific writing and presenting research, and 5) advance towards a career development award and independence as a clinical investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to prevent adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on a population level. However, ACEIs/ARBs are frequently discontinued despite guidelines recommending their use as first-line anti-hypertensive agents in CKD. This proposal aims to develop clinical tools that will predict whether individuals are likely to benefit versus be harmed by discontinuation of ACEIs/ARBs, with the goal of improving the safe and appropriate use of these agents in CKD.",Personalizing Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor and Angiotensin Receptor Blocker Therapy in Chronic Kidney Disease,10313873,F32DK130543,"['Acute', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Antihypertensive Agents', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'California', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Chronic Kidney Insufficiency', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease Outcome', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Familiarity', 'Funding', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertension', 'Hypotension', 'Individual', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Master&apos', 's Degree', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Proteinuria', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Recommendation', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'San Francisco', 'Solid', 'Stroke', 'Structural Models', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Writing', 'base', 'clinical development', 'clinical practice', 'disorder subtype', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hyperkalemia', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'personalized care', 'personalized decision', 'predictive modeling', 'premature', 'prevent', 'programs', 'skills', 'tool']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2021,88630
"Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use ABSTRACT: The use of prescription amphetamines for the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has markedly increased in the last fifteen years, with the greatest increase in adolescents and young adults. In 2007, the FDA mandated changes to stimulant labels to warn of increases in psychosis and mania in patients without pre-existing conditions. Our multidisciplinary research team from Brigham and Women's Hospital and McLean Hospital recently published a landmark cohort study demonstrating an increased risk of psychotic episodes in new users of amphetamine compared to methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD. Alarmingly, the use of amphetamines increased four-fold over the study period (2004 – 2015). In addition, our data show that prescription amphetamine use has dramatically increased in patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to accelerate knowledge about prescriber-level factors, patient-level factors and disease states that potentiate the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines. Large-scale studies using real-world data are the only option to study the risk of infrequent and serious adverse outcomes. In Aim 1, using incident-user cohort study designs, we will utilize data from two national administrative claims databases to identify prescriber dosing strategies that increase the risk of first-episode psychosis in ~220,000 adolescents and adults with ADHD initiating amphetamines. We hypothesize that there will be a dose-dependent increase in the risk of psychosis. The goal of Aim 2 is to identify patient subgroups at heightened risk of psychosis/mania with prescription amphetamine use. To accomplish this goal, we will perform a case control study using electronic medical records (EMR) from McLean Hospital in ~1,650 patients hospitalized for an initial episode of psychosis or mania compared to ~3,300 controls with a first psychiatric hospitalization for reasons other than psychosis or mania. We will apply natural language processing to unstructured narrative notes to capture detailed patient data not available in claims data. We hypothesize that patients with a family history of psychiatric illness will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without a family history. We also hypothesize that patients with concurrent cannabis use will have an increased risk of psychosis/mania with amphetamines compared to patients without cannabis use. Aim 3 compares the risk of treatment-emergent mania in ~52,000 new users of amphetamine versus methylphenidate in a cohort study of patients with pre-existing bipolar disorder, an urgent issue given the known risk of mania with stimulant use. Combined, these studies will provide actionable evidence to be incorporated into clinical practice guidelines with the goal of mitigating the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription stimulants. The proposed research agenda aligns with NIMH Strategic Objective 3.3 “Striving for Prevention and Cure” on testing interventions in real-world practice settings to evaluate the impact of patient- and provider-level factors on clinical outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE: In recent years, 6.1 million U.S. children and adolescents were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and 16 million adults reported past-year use of prescription stimulants. The research team recently found an increased risk of psychosis in new users of prescription amphetamines compared to new users of prescription methylphenidate in adolescents and young adults with ADHD, translating to potentially increased risk of psychosis for thousands of U.S. patients. Therefore, identifying patient subgroups and prescribing practices that increase the risk of psychosis and mania with prescription amphetamines has enormous public health significance and will guide providers to avoid amphetamines in patients at highest risk, preventing future cases of psychosis and mania.",Risk Factors for Psychosis and Mania with Prescription Amphetamine Use,10188647,R01MH122427,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent and Young Adult', 'Adult', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Amphetamine Users', 'Amphetamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Boston', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Clinical Practice Patterns', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'First Degree Relative', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Immigration', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Manic', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Modification', 'Mood stabilizers', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New England', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Practice Guidelines', 'Prevention', 'Principal Investigator', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Ritalin', 'Sampling', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Woman', 'adverse outcome', 'amphetamine use', 'base', 'comorbidity', 'comparative', 'cost effective', 'data warehouse', 'first episode psychosis', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'marijuana use', 'patient subsets', 'practice setting', 'prevent', 'provider factors', 'stimulant use', 'treatment risk', 'university student']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R01,2021,694144
"Biomechanical and Biological Predictors of Cartilage Health Following Meniscus Injury Abstract  Injury of the meniscus is frequently associated with early onset osteoarthritis (OA). Partial meniscectomy to remove the damaged meniscal tissue is the most commonly performed orthopaedic procedure. While this procedure can provide symptomatic relief in the short term, nearly 35% of patients develop radiographic evidence of OA within 5-7 years following surgery. However, the causes for this early onset OA are unknown. One potential pathway for the progression of knee OA following meniscectomy is through altered loading of the articular cartilage. However, other studies suggest that biological factors, such as joint inflammation may play an important role. Recently, through a combination of MR imaging, 3D modeling, and biplanar radiography, our team has shown that medial meniscal injury alters the cartilage-to-cartilage contact strains in both the medial and lateral compartments. In addition, we found that increased strain was correlated with increased levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity in the synovial fluid, a biomarker which may be indicative of joint degradation. Together, these results suggest that biomechanical and biological factors play an important role in the development of OA after meniscal injury. However, the role of partial meniscectomy on these changes is unclear. Thus, a comprehensive evaluation of the biomechanical and biological environment of the joint before and after partial meniscectomy will elucidate the factors that contribute to early onset OA. Our overall hypothesis is that following partial meniscectomy, both biomechanical and biological changes in the joint will predict cartilage degeneration. Furthermore, when biomechanical and biological predictors are combined together with patient demographics and clinical characteristics, we will identify well-defined clinical phenotypes of patients at high risk of cartilage degeneration.  Cartilage degeneration will be assessed through MR-based measures of cartilage thickness and composition. Using high speed biplanar x-ray and MR imaging, in vivo cartilage strains in both knees of patients with unilateral medial meniscus injury will be measured in response to treadmill walking prior to surgery and after surgery. Synovial fluid and serum will also be collected and a panel of pro-inflammatory mediators and tissue metabolic biomarkers will be measured. Synovial fluid immune cell analyses will be performed by flow cytometry. Using these biomechanical and biological factors, we will identify participants at increased risk for cartilage degeneration at two years after surgery. Then, using predictive models combining biomechanical factors, biological factors, demographics, and clinical characteristics, we will develop well-defined clinical phenotypes of cartilage degeneration risk. Importantly, the development of these phenotypes will enable targeted treatment approaches focused on surgery, pharmaceutical targets, and non-pharmacological interventions, such as physical rehabilitation strategies or weight loss, to prevent cartilage degeneration. Project Narrative Meniscus injuries are very common and frequently lead to early onset osteoarthritis, a leading cause of disability. This project will identify biomechanical and biological predictors of cartilage degeneration after meniscus injury and partial meniscectomy.

"Genetic and Genomic Dissection of Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is distinctive amongst the inflammatory/autoimmune joint diseases in that its onset is commonly preceded by cutaneous psoriasis (PsC). This provides an unparalleled opportunity for the identification of predictive biomarkers to determine which of the approximately 25% of psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) patients will develop PsA. Over the past decade, we have expanded our genetic study of PsV to focus on PsA, resulting in the collection of 1,279 PsA patients at Michigan, 743 of whom have already been subjected to GWAS. Initiated in 2007, the International Psoriatic Arthritis Research Team (IPART) has accumulated 1,919 Canadian PsA patients, of whom 1,370 have already been subjected to GWAS. In 2015, we completed a meta- GWAS of PsC and PsA involving a discovery cohort of 1,430 PsA cases and 1,417 controls, with 9,293 additional PsV replication samples (3,061 PsA, 3,110 PsC) and 13,670 controls. We detected 10 associations for PsA and 11 for PsC, as well as a new association for PsV. Utilizing an innovative core exome array to genotype additional cases and controls, we carried out the largest meta-GWAS of PsV to date (~40,000 subjects) and found 16 more susceptibility regions, highlighting the roles of interferon signaling and the NFB cascade, and demonstrating strong enrichment for psoriasis genetic signals in T-cell regulatory elements. Using machine learning to model ~200 genetic variants in our PsA vs. PsC GWAS, we achieved 82% area under receiver operator curve for distinguishing PsA vs PsC, with 98% accuracy among the top 10% of patients with the highest genetic load. We also carried out RNA-seq on mRNA and miRNA from 65 pairs of pre- and post-conversion samples from PsC patients who developed PsA. Suggestive of a shift from skin- focused to systemic autoimmunity, we found significant post-conversion enrichment for central memory CD4+ T-cell (CD4-Tcm) transcripts among the up-regulated genes. We also observed highly correlated pre- and post- conversion behaviors of 54 differentially-expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets, as well as multiple serum miRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed in PsA vs. PsC. A metabolomic study of 50 paired converter sera revealed 293 biochemicals with significant alterations, 275 of which were increased. Finally, we identified noncoding eQTLs for IL23R that correlate strikingly with a region of selective PsA association.  Based on these results, we hypothesize that PsA and PsC have pathogenetic mechanisms that are T-cell, osteoblast and osteoclast-driven and progress from skin to systemic during transition to PsA. We propose that this paradigm can be used to develop a useful test to predict PsA in PsC patients, while increasing our basic understanding of PsA. To test this hypothesis, we propose four aims: (1) to maintain and grow our longitudinal clinical resource; (2) To identify biomarkers for the development of PsA in PsC patients; (3) To integrate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2 into a clinically-useful tool for PsA identification using machine learning ; and (4) to explore the mechanisms by which the IL23R gene contributes to PsA pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a major health problem in the United States and around the world. The mechanisms that predispose patients with psoriasis to develop PsA are unknown. The proposed research will utilize the power of genome-wide association studies, transcriptome analysis, metabolomics, and the largest longitudinal resource of PsA in the world to develop a clinically-relevant tool for PsA prediction and to address a major gap in our mechanistic understanding of the causes of PsA. The results of this research are also likely to be relevant to other autoimmune diseases.",Genetic and Genomic Dissection of Psoriatic Arthritis,10208711,R01AR063611,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Banks', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chronic small plaque psoriasis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dermatology', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Michigan', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteoclasts', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Predisposition', 'Proteins', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'RNA', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'STAT3 gene', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Suggestion', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'TYK2', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'differential expression', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory CD4 T lymphocyte', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'osteoblast differentiation', 'predictive marker', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'systemic autoimmunity', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,608486
"A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases ABSTRACT  Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a global health epidemic and patients with CKD suffer from increased mortality and cardiovascular disease. Despite the severity of the disease, there are limited treatment options to hinder its progression. Tubular injury (TI) is a common finding on many kidney biopsies from patients with CKD, and there is mechanistic data supporting that TI can lead to interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. While interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy are the strongest known pathologic predictor of progression of CKD, we have limited understand of how TI contributes to this progression. Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF-1α) has been shown in animal studies to impact the severity of TI and is also known to trigger a fibrotic cascade, but there is limited data regarding its overall activity in kidney tissue, its cell type specific activity, its association with pathologic features or patient outcomes. It is of utmost importance to better understand this pathway as several Prolyl Hydroxylase inhibitors, which are novel therapeutic agents that increase the expression of HIF- 1α, are currently in clinical trial testing to treat anemia of CKD. The first aim of this proposal is to develop a measure of HIF-1α pathway activity that enables evaluation of clinical and morphologic features and cell-type specificity. Specifically, the candidate will a) Identify clinical and pathologic descriptors associated with increased HIF-1α pathway activity score and b) Determine the cell-type specific expression level of HIF-1α and its downstream components in tubular cells using single-cell RNA-sequencing. The second aim of this proposal is to determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity with outcomes and identify patients with increased HIF-1α activity non-invasively using biomarkers. Specifically, the candidate will a) Determine the association of increased HIF-1α activity score with patient outcomes and b) Identify serum or urine biomarkers that detect increased HIF-1α pathway activity in patients. The candidate will analyze data from 3 cohorts to accomplish these aims: Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE), Clinical Phenotyping Resource and Biobank Core (C-PROBE) and the Native Americans with Type 2 Diabetes cohort (formerly known as the Pima Indian cohort). These investigations will allow us to monitor HIF-1α activity non-invasively in trials where patients receive novel drug agents, such as Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors.  The candidate will obtain formal training in analysis of gene expression data, single cell RNA- sequencing and machine learning techniques during the course of the award period to successfully integrate gene expression data, pathology data and clinical data. She will be mentored by an expert team with complementary experience in nephrology, tubular injury biology, systems biology and bioinformatics. The long-term goal of these investigations is to ultimately be able to better sub-type patients with tubular injury based on mechanistic terms. NARRATIVE Chronic Kidney Disease is a global health epidemic and is associated with increased mortality, but we do not have a detailed understanding of why this disease progresses. Identifying sub-types of patients who progress by the same molecular mechanism is important to identify patients for future clinical trials. This project aims to use gene expression data from kidney biopsies to identify patients who will respond differently to medications that increase the expression of Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1 alpha.",A Systems Biology and Patient Stratification Approach to Improve Outcomes of Patients with Hypoxic Injury in Renal Tubular Cells in Chronic Kidney Diseases,10126847,K08DK124449,"['Address', 'Anemia', 'Animals', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Atrophic', 'Award', 'Beds', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemic', 'Erythropoietin', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Goals', 'Hypoxia', 'Hypoxia Inducible Factor', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Native Americans', 'Nephrology', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pima Indian', 'Process', 'Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase', 'Production', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tubular formation', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell type', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'experience', 'global health', 'glomerulosclerosis', 'hypoxia inducible factor 1', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'interstitial', 'kidney biopsy', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'phase III trial', 'predictive marker', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'transcription factor']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2021,168955
"Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease Project Summary/Abstract  In 2016, 47,000 individuals who initiated dialysis in the United States (~42% of all incident dialysis patients that year) had obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kilograms per meters squared. Across the BMI spectrum, individuals with kidney disease commonly lose weight after initiating dialysis treatment. However, whereas body weight typically stabilizes after the first several months of dialysis among patients without obesity, those with obesity often continue to lose weight. Both people with and without obesity who are on dialysis may lose weight due to muscle wasting and malnutrition, and recent studies have identified weight loss as a risk factor for death among people on dialysis, independent of BMI. Yet, some of the weight loss observed among obese dialysis patients may also reflect deliberate attempts to improve health, mobility, or access to kidney transplantation. Currently, there are no guidelines to help clinicians to differentiate between healthy and high-risk weight loss among people with obesity on dialysis. Further, typical obesity management paradigms are not easily transferrable to obese people with end-stage kidney disease, given factors such as chronic malnutrition, inflammation, and sarcopenia in this population that may modify the risks and benefits of different weight loss strategies. Therefore, the overarching goal of this five-year research proposal is to define healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes among people with obesity who are on dialysis, and to provide clinically feasible tools to improve obesity management in the setting of end-stage kidney disease. We will accomplish this goal by conducting three distinct but interrelated studies. In the first study, we will qualitatively determine patient-prioritized endpoints of weight loss, in addition to patient, physician and other stakeholder perspectives on the key factors that differentiate healthy from high-risk weight loss on dialysis. In the second study, we will leverage a national dataset of 23,000 obese dialysis patients and apply constructs of high and low physiologic reserve to derive healthy and high-risk weight loss phenotypes. We will then develop a weight- loss risk calculator tool that predicts the risks of hospitalization and death that are associated with each weight loss phenotype, using dynamic predictive joint models and machine learning techniques. In the third study, we will enroll 250 obese dialysis patients in a prospective, longitudinal study across five regions in the United States to evaluate the association between nutritional, inflammatory, and hemodynamic biomarkers and measures of health trajectory that are not typically captured in registry data, such as sarcopenia, dynapenia, body composition, and patient-prioritized endpoints such as quality of life. In accomplishing its aims, this research will provide urgently needed knowledge and tools that will improve the medical management of tens of thousands of people with end-stage kidney disease and obesity, ensuring that clinicians will be better able to incorporate patient-prioritized outcomes into assessments of weight loss interventions, and recognize and mitigate the effects of high-risk weight loss. Project Narrative Although over 40,000 obese individuals with end-stage kidney disease initiate dialysis each year in the United States, there are no guidelines on optimal obesity management in the setting of dialysis care. Obese dialysis patients may lose weight due to chronic illness or due to intentional weight loss attempts, though it is difficult to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss in these patients. This proposal seeks to advance the science of obesity management in dialysis settings by providing new tools to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy weight loss trajectories among obese dialysis patients.",Identifying Healthy and High-Risk Weight Loss Phenotypes to Optimize Obesity Management in End Stage Kidney Disease,10179372,R01DK124388,"['Benefits and Risks', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body Composition', 'Body Weight', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dietitian', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Hemodialysis', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Intake', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Kilogram', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Malnutrition', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Muscle function', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Nephrology', 'Non obese', 'Nutritional', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Services', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Transplant Recipients', 'United States', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'experience', 'hazard', 'health related quality of life', 'healthy weight', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved mobility', 'inflammatory marker', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meter', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'novel', 'nutrition', 'obese patients', 'obese person', 'obesity management', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'reduced muscle strength', 'sarcopenia', 'sleep quality', 'stakeholder perspectives', 'tool', 'weight loss intervention']",NIDDK,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,291877
"A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients Summary – Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic began, the emergence of an associated novel multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has been reported. Interestingly, patients with MIS-C follow a presentation, management and clinical course that are somewhat similar to that of patients with Kawasaki disease (KD). Currently, the reason for such an overlap in clinical features and management is unclear and whether this overlap is the result of a partially shared etiology or pathophysiology is the subject of fierce debates. The degree of overlap implies that some of the clinical prediction tools that we have developed in the past for KD could be repurposed to accelerate the development of clinical support decision tools for MIS-C. In this study, we will first (R61 component) systematically address the overlap between KD and MIS-C and create salient machine-learning based prediction models for diagnosis/identification (Aim #1), management (Aim #2), and short- and long-term outcomes (Aim #3) of MIS-C based on our previously developed predictive models for KD in a process akin to transfer learning. Secondly (R33 component), we will validate and evaluate the performance and clinical utility of these models in a predictive clinical decision support system for the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients presenting with features indicative of either MIS-C or KD. In this study we will include 3 groups of patients: 1) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with MIS-C (CDC criteria) regardless of whether they have overlapping signs of KD, 2) patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection investigated for but eventually not diagnosed with MIS-C, and 3) patients with KD but without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Targeted data will be collected from enrolled patients (900 for training and 450 for validation) for deep phenotyping and biomarker measurements. Physician feedback on the predictions generated by the algorithm will be used to establish clinical utility. Data required for model training will be accrued in the first two years of activity (R61 period of the grant); the development of algorithms and their internal validation will occur concurrently. In the following 2 years (R33 period of the grant), we will perform external validation, establish clinical utility, add real- time epidemiological surveillance data to the models and finally package, and certify the algorithms for future deployment and for the integration in electronic health records. This project will be a collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) Consortium. The IKDR Consortium has an active KD and pediatric COVID registry in 35 sites across the world and the number of sites is currently expanding to 60+ sites. More than 600 MIS-C patients have already been identified at IKDR centers, making this project clearly feasible and perfectly positioning IKDR to perform this study. We strongly believe that the use of emerging data science methods and of our previously developed algorithms in the context of KD, as opposed to focusing on MIS-C patients alone, will boost our understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of both MIS-C and KD and will more rapidly lead to the emergence of data-driven management protocols for patients with MIS-C. Project narrative - The primary objective of this study is to design and validate a predictive decision support system for the identification, treatment and management of SARS-CoV-2 associated with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). To develop this system, we will adapt and retrain machine learning algorithms which we have previously trained in patients with Kawasaki Disease, a pediatric inflammatory vasculopathy with multiple similarities to MIS-C. This study, performed in collaboration with the International Kawasaki Disease Registry (IKDR) consortium, will consist of two phases, first a large-scale data collection and algorithm development effort and second, the prospective evaluation of the performance and clinical utility of the algorithm ahead of large-scale deployment.",A data science approach to identify and manage Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and Kawasaki disease in pediatric patients,10272448,R61HD105591,"['2019-nCoV', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Management', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiologic Monitoring', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Inflammatory', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Decision Support Systems', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mucocutaneous Lymph Node Syndrome', 'Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children', 'Newly Diagnosed', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'SARS-CoV-2 exposure', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Site', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'algorithm development', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical predictors', 'coronavirus disease', 'design', 'disease registry', 'epidemiologic data', 'experience', 'interoperability', 'large scale data', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medical complication', 'novel', 'optimal treatments', 'pediatric patients', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'surveillance data', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R61,2021,917957
"Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy PROJECT SUMMARY The era of “big data” has opened the door for genomic and systems biology approaches to be applied to current challenges in life sciences and precision medicine. One critical challenge in these areas is how to prioritize research findings to validate and identify actionable insights that can translate into better outcomes for patients. In this regard, we have assembled a multidisciplinary group of scientists and physicians from academia and industry with a focus on creating discovery pipelines that combine high-throughput profiling technologies with advanced statistical and machine learning approaches to generate predictive tools that enable us to move rapidly from big data to better diagnoses and treatment. In this regard, we propose to apply these approaches to develop a computational clinical decision tool that will improve disease forecasting and treatment plans for Multiple Myeloma (MM), an incurable cancer that originates in bone marrow plasma cells and affects more than 30,000 patients a year. Though there have been some advances in the number and diversity of available therapeutic options for these patients, relapse remains inevitable, and MM ultimately remains a terminal diagnosis. The clinical assay and computational pipeline developed in this project will combine a targeted sequencing panel specific to myeloma patients and clonality estimates with RNA- sequencing and drug repurposing to expand therapeutic options for MM patients. We will develop this unique tool with the following specific aims: (1) Develop an integrated genomic clinical decision tool to guide precision treatment of MM and validate therapy recommendations using PDX profiling, and (2) Validate MM precision medicine platform in a prospective clinical trial and generate clone-specific treatment recommendations. To achieve these objectives, we will integrate a Cancer Genetic, Inc.'s FOCUS::Myeloma panel, a targeted panel designed to specifically interrogateall the genes and copy number alterations commonly altered in myeloma, and into a computational drug selection pipeline that utilizes RNA-sequencing data and drug repurposing algorithms to generate therapeutic recommendations matched to a patient's unique disease profile. These recommendations will be validated in mouse avatars of myeloma to confirm and refine drug predictions. We will implement our assay in a prospective clinical trial of 100 patients to determine if the treatment decisions generated by our pipeline achieves an improvement in standard-of-care. Finally, we will perform clonal modeling on relapsed patients to retrospectively evaluate clone-specific treatment responses. Completion of these studies will result in a clinic-ready assay and computational tool that will guide MM precision treatment decisions and inform new therapeutic strategies based on a patient's unique cancer profile. genomic clonal modeling PROJECT NARRATIVE Multiple Myeloma is an incurable cancer of the blood that takes the lives of over 12,000 people every year. It remains a difficult disease to treat due to its genetic complexity from the earliest stages of the disease, indicating a need for a precision medicine approach in treating these patients. In this application Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai will partner with Cancer Genetics, Inc. to develop a multi-omics clinical decision assay that will improve long-term outcomes for patients with advanced myeloma and generate valuable insights and tools that can be broadly leveraged for other disease indications.",Development of a multi-omic clinical decision platform to guide personalized therapy,10101640,R01CA244899,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Sciences', 'Bone Marrow', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clonality', 'Computer Models', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug resistance', 'Employment', 'Event', 'Gene Dosage', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genomics', 'Health', 'Hematopoietic Neoplasms', 'Heterogeneity', 'Industry', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Intake', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Mus', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Physicians', 'Plasma Cells', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'RNA', 'Recommendation', 'Refractory', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Scientist', 'Selection for Treatments', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Stream', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Xenograft procedure', 'base', 'cancer genetics', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically actionable', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'disorder subtype', 'drug repurposing', 'efficacy testing', 'genomic data', 'genomic profiles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'medical schools', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient derived xenograft model', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'pilot trial', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predictive tools', 'profiles in patients', 'prospective', 'relapse patients', 'risk stratification', 'standard of care', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor xenograft']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,531246
"A multifaceted adaptive mobile application to promote self-management and improve outcomes in heart failure PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure (HF) is the most common hospital discharge diagnosis among older adults in the United States. Strikingly, 2 in 5 patients are readmitted within 1-year following their first HF admission. This results in significant potentially avoidable costs to our already strained healthcare system, since hospitalizations result in 70% of yearly HF management costs. The most common causes of readmission are failure to recognize clinical worsening and dietary nonadherence. As a result, HF management is rapidly evolving from the traditional model of face-to-face follow-up visits toward a proactive real-time technological model of assisting patients with monitoring and self-management while in the community. While several HF studies have implemented technologically-driven disease management programs, results have been mixed. These systems effectively deliver monitoring data and alerts to healthcare providers. However, their effectiveness in delivering behavioral interventions to patients and modifying patient behavior, a crucial factor in HF self-management, is unknown. Therefore, it is imperative to develop and test patient- centered technologies that deliver behavioral interventions to promote self-management for the most common causes of readmissions with an overall goal of reducing HF readmissions. This proposed project will determine the effectiveness of two interventions within a mobile application and builds on our work from previous research. Our central hypothesis is that a patient-centered mobile application with contextual just-in-time interventions about self-management during a clinical worsening and dietary sodium will improve the health status of HF patients. The rationale for this project, which is supported by our preliminary data, is that a new model for disease management - placing patients in control of their condition - will have a substantial positive impact on HF outcomes. Our objectives are to: (1) determine the impact of two unique adaptive mobile application interventions on HF readmission and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in HF patients, (2) establish the effect the interventions have on proximal outcomes and that the proximal outcomes mediate the intervention’s impact on HF readmission and HRQOL, and (3) develop data-driven machine learning models that can predict episodes of clinical worsening.

"Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a heterogeneous, life-threatening condition defined by poor oxygenation and bilateral pulmonary edema that carries a mortality rate >40% in most studies. Every ARDS drug trial to date has failed, perhaps because the clinical criteria defining ARDS include a substantial subset of low-risk patients. Clinical scoring systems poorly predict which ARDS patients will develop prolonged respiratory failure and are at increased risk of death.  Molecular profiling of pulmonary edema fluid could serve as a window on the alveolar microenvironment, enabling identification of high-risk patients. Pulmonary edema directly reflects lung pathobiology including loss of barrier integrity, inflammation, and epithelial damage. Unfortunately, free-flowing pulmonary edema has limited clinical utility because it can only be captured in a minority of patients. Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema is now possible in every patient with ARDS because of two critical innovations. First, we discovered that edema fluid condensing in the HME (heat and moisture exchanger) filter of the ventilator circuit, usually discarded as trash, closely reflects free-flowing edema. Second, we developed a non-targeted metabolomic fingerprinting method using mass spectroscopy that characterizes molecular components in trace quantities of fluid. Together, these innovations make it possible to test the central hypothesis that molecular features of edema fluid reflect pathobiology and enable ARDS risk stratification.  To address the prognostic enrichment potential of HME edema fluid, 300 early ARDS patients will be recruited at 3 US centers, with protocolized HME edema fluid collection. Aim 1 is to study whether high HME edema fluid total protein and lung-injury specific proteins predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. Aim 2 is to test whether hypermetabolic edema fluid and inflammatory lipids predict prolonged respiratory failure ≥48h in ARDS. In Aim 3, LASSO machine learning will be used to integrate all proteomic and metabolomic edema features into a prolonged mechanical ventilation classifier. The robustness of the classifier will be assessed by measuring whether it adds prognostic value to clinical ARDS severity scores, identifying how well key molecular features are reflected in plasma, and testing for replication in an independent cohort.  The goal of these studies is to examine to what extent a novel and readily available lung-specific sample, obtained early in the course of ARDS, reflects biology and can predict ARDS outcomes, thus offering prognostic enrichment for future clinical trials. Successful completion of the Specific Aims offers the potential for a much-needed classification scheme to better refine, understand, and therapeutically-target ARDS. PROJECT NARRATIVE Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a common, life-threatening condition with no approved drug treatments. Pulmonary edema is a cardinal feature of ARDS and is mirrored closely by edema fluid collected passively in the Heat Moisture Exchanger (HME) filter; thus HME filter edema provides a novel and completely non-invasive window to the alveolar microenvironment. This proposal seeks to understand whether molecular characteristics of HME filter edema predict prolonged respiratory failure and could facilitate enrollment of high-risk patients into ARDS clinical trials.",Molecular characterization of pulmonary edema: a window to an injured lung,10231005,R01HL152083,"['Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Alveolar', 'Bilateral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bronchoscopy', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Classification Scheme', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Edema', 'Electrons', 'Enrollment', 'Epithelial', 'Failure', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Informatics', 'Intensive Care', 'Life', 'Lipids', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Protocols documentation', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiratory Failure', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Ventilator', 'alveolar epithelium', 'cohort', 'effective therapy', 'epithelial injury', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'ionization', 'lung injury', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'primary outcome', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'protein metabolite', 'receptor for advanced glycation endproducts', 'recruit', 'risk stratification', 'secondary outcome', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment strategy']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,539888
"Refining repeat screening for coronary artery disease in kidney transplant candidates 7. Project Summary This K23 proposal will provide Xingxing S. Cheng, MD, MS with the protected time, mentorship, training, and research experience to become an independent clinical investigator. Dr. Cheng is a board-certified nephrologist and accredited transplant nephrologist, with a long-term vision of improving the effectiveness of health care for kidney transplant patients. She seeks to combine patient-oriented research and decision science to find innovative solutions to clinical problems. Skills she will acquire in this grant, under the guidance of a strong mentorship team, include 1) integration of patient-oriented research and decision analytic models; 2) assessing the heterogeneity of response in different patient subgroups; and 3) advanced modelling skills. This grant proposes to refine the process of screening of coronary artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease on the wait-list awaiting kidney transplantation. Currently, patients undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, few of which result in interventions. These tests impose a high treatment burden on patients and potentially delay time to transplant, while bringing unclear benefit to the patient. This grant proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients with diabetes mellitus). It will examine strategies that vary the frequency of cardiac testing and risk stratification for cardiac testing based on a simple, inexpensive, and non-invasive test that can be performed in routine clinical settings, a 6-minute walk test (6MWT). This project will achieve this broad aim by three specific aims: 1) to characterize the 6MWT in identifying low-risk patients who do not additional cardiac testing; 2) to model strategies varying the frequency of cardiac testing and use of 6MWT; 3) to design strategies personalized for specific patient subgroups and model them in the entire kidney transplant candidate population of the United States (US). The first two aims will arise from a well-characterized cohort of patients at Dr. Cheng’s institution. Machine-learning systems will be used to identify which patient subgroups are best served by which strategies (i.e. the heterogeneity of response). The third aim will leverage the US Renal Data System, which Dr. Cheng’s mentors and institution has a track record of leveraging for innovative research. The proposed work has high potential to make a significant clinical impact. Its completion will enable the identification and characterization of rational strategies for pre-transplant screening of coronary artery disease that may be incorporated into clinical practice or pave the way for a future multi-center comparative effectiveness trial. The proposed work is realistic and feasible within the award period, and will allow Dr. Cheng to build research skills, advance and disseminate scientific knowledge, create additional collaborative networks, and compete for R01 or equivalent funding. In summary, the K23 award will provide the support to enable Dr. Cheng to become a successful independent clinical investigator. 8. Project Narrative Currently, patients on the kidney transplant waitlist undergo repeat cardiac screening tests at frequent intervals, but relatively few interventions result. This project proposes to refine the cardiac screening strategy and personalize it for specific patient subgroups (e.g. elderly patients without diabetes mellitus), by examining strategies that reduce the frequency of cardiac testing and use performance-based risk stratification to reduce the number of patients who need cardiac testing.

"Development of quantitative tools to predict patients with difficult intubation to minimize treatment related complications ABSTRACT Endotracheal mouth/nose breathing need 10% this to performing subjective poorly standard Unfortunately, these airway examination systems in clinical practice perform only modestly, with sensitivities of 20-62%, specificities of 82-97%, and very low positive predictive values, generally less than 30%, unless very liberal definitions of difficulty are used. There are likely a number of reasons for this poor performance, including the relative rarity of difficult intubation, the multifactorial etiology and varying definition of difficult intubation, inter-observer variability in test results, failure to validate potential systems in patients independent of those used to derive the test, and the inadequacy of the tests themselves. intubation (EI) is a common medical procedure in which a plastic tube is introduced via the into the trachea, to provide respiratory support during general anesthesia or to ameliorate difficulty in cases of respiratory failure, cardiac arrest, or other forms of critical illness. The global for EI is likely at least 150 million based on the WHO estimate of surgical need worldwide. Approximately  of EI attempts are difficult, and approximately 1/2000 are deemed impossible. The clinica l significance of “can't intubate, can't ventilate” scenario is extremely important: 25% of anesthetic related deaths are due airway mishaps. Patients are typically assessed for anatomic features that might predict difficulty in EI prior to the procedure. In practice, anesthesiologists and other airway experts likely weigh other factors in anticipating a difficult airway, including habitus, facial appearance, and perhaps other understood hunches. The use of this examination to predict difficult intubation is considered the of care in modern anesthesiology practice.

"Inconspicuous Daily Monitoring to Reduce Heart Failure Hospitalizations Project Summary/Abstract In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This is especially important for cardiovascular disease (CVD); the leading cause of death worldwide. Heart failure (HF), a type of CVD characterized by a weakened heart muscle, impacts approximately 6.5 million Americans with over 960,000 new cases each year. HF costs the US an estimated $30.7 billion annually and is expected to increase 127% to $69.7 billion by 2030. With approximately 80% of the total cost associated with HF due to hospitalization, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost of HF by lowering hospitalization rates through remote patient monitoring. Since patient awareness of symptomology often lags deterioration, successfully tracking physiologic changes in the home is a critical component of an early intervention strategy. Classical approaches to in-home monitoring, such as blood pressure and weight monitoring have had limited success, with patient adherence cited as major barrier to reducing hospitalizations. The central hypothesis of this research is that hospitalization rates and duration of stay for heart failure patients can be significantly reduced through inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention. This research will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated toilet seat (FIT). The FIT seat automatically captures a comprehensive cardiovascular assessment in the home, while ensuring long-term patient adherence. A multidisciplinary research team, comprised of engineers, physicians, advanced practice providers (APP), data scientists, biostatisticians, designers, and software developers, will advance an automated system that provides health care providers with early warning of patient deterioration using the FIT system measurements captured in the home. The success of this system will be evaluated through an in-home clinical trial of heart failure patients. Specific Aim 1 seeks to create a learning dataset and data visualization architecture from HF patient in-home physiologic data, perceived wellness, and adverse events. The FIT seat will be deployed for a 90-day in-home study of 200 HF patients, with patient perceived wellness and activity captured through a custom application. This physiologic, wellness, and activity data will be combined with adverse events from the electronic medical record to create an integrated dataset for retrospective analysis and alert model development. In Aim 2, an automated prediction model for early alert of all-cause hospitalizations will be created using novel machine learning techniques. The objective of Aim 3 is to demonstrate that inconspicuous in-home monitoring and early intervention can reduce hospitalizations in a second cohort of 200 HF patients. We hypothesize that the integrated FIT-based alert system will reduce the burden of all-cause hospitalization and will improve the quality of life for patients. Project Summary/Abstract In-home monitoring technologies have the potential to transform the healthcare system by enabling the transition from reactive care to proactive and preventive care. This study will leverage a highly innovative technology for cardiovascular in-home daily monitoring; the fully integrated toilet seat (FIT). A multidisciplinary research team, comprised of engineers, physicians, advanced practice providers, data scientists, biostatisticians, designers, and software developers, will advance an automated system that provides health care providers with early warning of patient deterioration through an in-home clinical trial of heart failure patients.",Inconspicuous Daily Monitoring to Reduce Heart Failure Hospitalizations,10198041,R01NR018301,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adverse event', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Behavior', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Control Groups', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Deterioration', 'Early Intervention', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Generations', 'Habits', 'Health Personnel', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Instruction', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Interview', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Myocardium', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Preventive care', 'Probability', 'Provider', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Slide', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Update', 'Visit', 'Weight', 'Work', 'base', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'compliance behavior', 'cost', 'data streams', 'data visualization', 'heart rate variability', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'innovative technologies', 'model development', 'multidimensional data', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'provider intervention', 'recurrent neural network', 'remote patient monitoring', 'success', 'trend']",NINR,ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,410482
"Collaborative multi-site project to speed the identification and management of rare genetic immune diseases Summary  The subject of this proposal is a new, collaborative approach to improve the diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs). These patients have individually rare, monogenic disorders leading to severe infections, autoimmunity, and inflammation. The prevalence of PIDs is ~1:10,000 and approximately half have antibody deficiencies as their main immunological phenotype. Most doctors are unaware of these diseases and many patients go years without a diagnosis, costing the system tens of thousands of dollars per patient yearly and unnecessarily increasing morbidity and mortality. There is a tremendous, untapped opportunity to advance the diagnosis of patients with PIDs.  We propose to utilize new machine-learning approaches to algorithmically identify patients with PIDs from their electronic health records (EHR). To accomplish our goals, we have built a coalition of computational genomics groups at UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt (Computational team), and clinical immunology groups at the five University of California medical centers (Los Angeles, San Francisco, Irvine, San Diego, and Davis) (Immunology team). We propose to: Identify patients with rare immune diseases by phenotype risk scoring (Aim 1). We will speed the identification of patients with rare immune diseases by surveilling the EHR using a phenotype risk scoring approach, building upon recently published work in Science. We will apply this approach to the UCLA, UCSF, and Vanderbilt clinical data repositories to identify potential cases. We will improve risk scoring by considering gender, age, and race/ethnicity. We will classify patients by whether they have an infection phenotype or immune dysregulation phenotype. Subsequently, we will expand to the larger, UC Health-wide Data Warehouse (UCHWDW), entailing 15+ million patients across all UC medical centers. We will then Identify the genetic immune diseases for these newly found subjects (Aim 2). We will follow the state-of-the-art approach employed by the UCLA and Vanderbilt Undiagnosed Disease Network (UDN) sites. We will start by sequencing all the known antibody deficiency patients across the Immunology team sites while collaboratively pre-reviewing identified cases from Aim 1 on monthly video-calls. For selected subjects, we will perform whole genome and RNA sequencing. Clinical and research laboratory testing will bring closure to the diagnostic odyssey for these subjects.  The overall impact of this work accelerates the diagnosis and cure of PIDs. This project will also serve as a demonstration of how immunology sites can work together sharing electronic medical records and genomic data to advance care. Narrative A major challenge for patients with immune diseases is the delay in diagnosis that leads to morbidity and mortality. This proposal combines teams from the five medical centers of the University of California and Vanderbilt to apply advanced computational, machine-learning approaches to identify patients with genetic immunodeficiency diseases. This approach will dramatically improve the care of otherwise-neglected patients with rare diseases.",Collaborative multi-site project to speed the identification and management of rare genetic immune diseases,10220648,R01AI153827,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmunity', 'Awareness', 'Bronchiectasis', 'California', 'Caring', 'Case Report Form', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Immunology', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Common Variable Immunodeficiency', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Immune System Diseases', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes', 'Immunological Diagnosis', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Research', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Los Angeles', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Immunity', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'San Francisco', 'Schedule', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Work', 'adaptive immunity', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'clinical data repository', 'clinical data warehouse', 'collaborative approach', 'congenital immunodeficiency', 'cost', 'data standards', 'data warehouse', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease phenotype', 'falls', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'health data', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical specialties', 'mortality', 'neglect', 'next generation', 'peer', 'psychosocial', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'whole genome']",NIAID,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,806368
"A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There is mounting concern that patients hospitalized with COVID-19 experience unexpectedly high rates of cardiac and vascular events. Identifying which patients are at highest risk for COVID-19-related cardiovascular events and delineating how these events affect short- and long-term outcomes may help support individualized patient care, illuminate underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms, and accelerate the development of effective therapies. However, little is known about how multi-dimensional risk factors, including prior medical conditions, socioeconomic indicators, and circulating levels of biomarkers affect patient outcomes. Building on our team's expertise in data linkage, prediction modeling, and biomarker discovery, we will create a unique and powerful linked data resource to characterize the biological, clinical, health system, and socioeconomic risk factors for the development of cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 and examine their impact on health outcomes. To create this data resource, we have partnered with the American Heart Association, whose COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry is actively capturing high-quality, standardized information on all adults hospitalized with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection at >100 U.S. sites spanning 30 states. We will link this registry to comprehensive health care claims, a national socioeconomic deprivation index, and detailed health care system information. In Aim 1, we will apply traditional and machine learning approaches to the linked multicenter registry in order to identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) among COVID-19 patients. In Aim 2, we will characterize long-term MACE (i.e., at 1 and 2 years after discharge from the index COVID-19 hospitalization) among older adults in a large multicenter registry linked with longitudinal Medicare claims, and identify the clinical, health system, and socioeconomic factors that predict their occurrence. Based on this work, we will create clinically implementable risk scores which will estimate, at the time of admission for and discharge from an index COVID-19 hospitalization, a patient's risk of developing a major cardiovascular event. In Aim 3, we evaluate the proteomic profiles of a subset of patients in the linked registry with biobanked serial blood samples, and identify biochemical markers that predict the occurrence of MACE, both during index hospitalization for COVID-19 and after discharge. This research will advance our collective understanding of the biological, clinical, and socioeconomic predictors of COVID-19-related cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. By identifying patients at greatest at risk of cardiovascular events, our work will help frontline clinicians better individualize clinical management strategies and health systems improve care delivery during future waves of the pandemic. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular events (heart damage, stroke, blood clots) appear to be both common and dangerous in patients who are hospitalized with COVID-19. A better understanding of which patients are at highest risk for these events is a key step to developing better approaches for prevention and treatment. We will combine multiple sources of information, including a large national COVID-19 registry from the American Heart Association, health care data from Medicare, and blood protein levels from patients treated at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, to identify the factors that are associated with a higher risk of short- and long-term cardiovascular events among patients hospitalized with COVID-19.","A Multi-Dimensional Linked Registry to Identify Biological, Clinical, Health System, and Socioeconomic Risk Factors for COVID-19-Related Cardiovascular Events",10183512,R01HL157530,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'American Heart Association', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Communities', 'Comprehensive Health Care', 'Dangerousness', 'Data', 'Data Linkages', 'Deep Vein Thrombosis', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Embolism', 'Event', 'Future', 'Geography', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Israel', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocarditis', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevention approach', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'biomarker discovery', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'care delivery', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'data resource', 'deprivation', 'disease registry', 'effective therapy', 'experience', 'heart damage', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'medical information system', 'mortality', 'older patient', 'pandemic disease', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized management', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'risk prediction', 'rurality', 'socioeconomics']",NHLBI,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,873210
"Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes Summary The objective of this proposal is to optimize the design and evaluate a robust artificial pancreas (R-AP) system for use in patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes (T1D) with HbA1C greater than 8% and compare HbA1C outcomes in these patients relative to a decision support system that utilizes continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy. Although high risk patients have possibly the most to gain from usage of AP technology, they are oftentimes under-represented or excluded from clinical trials. This has been because of the increased risk of failure of these AP systems that were not designed to handle inconsistent reporting of meals, variable activity level, and infusion set failures. An AP system for high risk patients needs to be designed to achieve maximal benefit, including reducing the risk of acute and chronic complications. A major obstacle for enabling the AP for usage by high-risk patients is that these patients may be less compliant with use guidelines for the system including missed meal announcements, infrequent sensor calibrations, and prolonged infusion set wear leading to infusion set failures. In this grant, we will integrate new risk-mitigation features into the OHSU single-hormone AP to enable usage by high-risk patients that fall into the categories described above. We present new algorithms for automating the detection of missed meal announcements, missed calibrations, and robust handling of hybrid usage mode. While AP systems may be an optimal choice for improving glycemic control, many people with T1D prefer MDI therapy. Decision support systems such as the DailyDose decision support system developed at OHSU can be used to improve glycemic control for patients who prefer MDI therapy. The DailyDose decision support system is designed for CGM augmented MDI therapy. It enables on-demand calculation of insulin doses, automates insulin dose adjustments based on pattern recognition, and uses machine learning approaches to alert the patients to events such as predicted hypoglycemia and missed meal doses.The benefit of the DailyDose system is that it is a simple system and does not require use of an insulin pump, which may be a challenge for some patients with uncontrolled type 1 diabetes as pump therapy is more intensive and requires infusion set changes. It is unknown in this high risk group of people whether patient needs, quality of life, and glycemic control are best addressed with an AP system or decision support tool or if both treatments are appropriate. We have designed a 3-month clinical study to compare glycemic outcomes during AP vs. decision support interventions in a high- risk T1D cohort (HbA1C 8-10.5%), with the aim of demonstrating a significant clinically relevant reduction in HbA1C. Our hypothesis is that both AP and decision support therapies will decrease HbA1C relative to baseline but that the AP will provide further benefit over DailyDose. Project Narrative Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, kidney failure, and non-traumatic amputations. We propose to integrate features into the OHSU artificial pancreas to optimize it for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes (HbA1c>8-10.5%) and compare it to DailyDose, a decision support system that uses multiple daily injections.",Improving glucose control with advanced technology designed for high risk patients with type 1 diabetes,10144423,R01DK120367,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Awareness', 'Behavioral', 'Blindness', 'Bluetooth', 'Calibration', 'Carbohydrates', 'Categories', 'Cellular Phone', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Ketoacidosis', 'Dose', 'Emotional', 'Event', 'Exercise', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Glycosylated hemoglobin A', 'Grant', 'Guidelines', 'Hormones', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hyperglycemia', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Infusion procedures', 'Injection of therapeutic agent', 'Injections', 'Inpatients', 'Insulin', 'Insulin Infusion Systems', 'Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Failure', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modification', 'Multicenter Trials', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Outcome Study', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Pump', 'Quality of life', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'arm', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'blood glucose regulation', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'design', 'diabetes distress', 'engineering design', 'expectation', 'falls', 'glucose monitor', 'glycemic control', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'implementation design', 'improved', 'in silico', 'patient population', 'primary outcome', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'risk minimization', 'risk mitigation', 'secondary outcome', 'sensor', 'smart watch', 'support tools']",NIDDK,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,592875
"Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients Severe trauma injury renders patients vulnerable to infections and subsequent risk of infections-related outcomes, including multiple organ failure/dysfunction syndrome (MOF/MODS), a major cause of mortality and morbidity. Although it is well-established that infection is a major risk factor for MOF, not all patients who experience nosocomial infections develop MOF, highlighting the importance of considering the underlying molecular biological mechanisms of heterogeneity in susceptibility to MOF development after infections (ie. infections-related MOF). In current clinical practices, MOF-specific score systems based on physiological measurements such as the Denver and Marshall Scores are monitored and used to diagnose patients with MOF after its onset. Here we propose to build prediction models for infections-related MOF before its onset using molecular signatures in order to significantly increase prediction accuracy. Methods of rapid (ie. immediately after the detection of infection) and accurate identification of patients who are highly susceptible to infections- related outcomes are expected to aid in informed decision-making and ensuring appropriate delivery of preventative measures to control MOF incidence. Such methods may thus result in improved health of patients and reduced health care costs. This proposal aims to employ an unbiased computational approach to investigate genome-wide transcriptome profiles and develop a panel of biomarkers to predict infections-related MOF immediately after the detection of infection. Previous transcriptome studies in the context of infections often focus on patient responses to infection. In contrast, we propose to focus on biomarker panel development to predict a specific infections-related adverse outcome before it occurrs. Two Aims are proposed to predict the outcome of infections-related MOF among blunt trauma patients, a population that is highly susceptible to infections. Aim 1: using blood samples from the Inflammation and the Host Response to Injury Study (“Glue Grant”), we will utilize our early blood transcriptome multi-biomarker development machine learning pipeline to build models for prediction of infections-related MOF outcome among a cohort of blunt trauma patients. Aim 2: we will build prediction models using injury severity scores and other common demographic and clinical variables for infections-related MOF and compare their performance with the multi-biomarker model. We hypothesize that, in comparison to models based on clinical scores, our proposed strategy based on transcriptomic signatures will result in an increasingly accurate prediction and, furthermore, provide insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to MOF after infection. Identification of these molecular mechanisms may ultimately aid in uncovering potential targets for pharmacological interventions. Overall, results from this study may provide the foundation for further studies of infections-related outcome prediction in different blunt trauma cohorts, as well as in cohorts affected by other types of trauma. The methods and findings from this study may also be applicable to other immunocompromised populations, such as cancer patients and post-surgery patients. Severe trauma renders patients immunocompromised and vulnerable to infections that often lead to life- threatening conditions, such as multiple organ failure (MOF). Our study proposes to provide a personalized medicine strategy for rapidly and accurately identifying patients who are at high risk of developing MOF immediately after they experience infection. Early risk profiling will aid clinicians in informed decision-making to improve patient outcomes and may also lead to the development of new preventative methods.",Multi Biomarker-based prediction tool development to determine risk of infections-related outcomes among severe blunt trauma patients,10126230,R03AI151499,"['APACHE II', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Assessment tool', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Cancer Patient', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Glossary', 'Glues', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immune response', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunosuppression', 'Incidence', 'Infection', 'Infection prevention', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Injury Severity Score', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiple Organ Failure', 'Nosocomial Infections', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Predisposition', 'Preventive measure', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'Sterility', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomarker panel', 'clinical database', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'new therapeutic target', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient oriented', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic tool', 'rapid technique', 'resilience', 'response', 'response to injury', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIAID,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,84000
"MINDS Imaging Ancillary Study Dramatic advances in management of congenital heart disease (CHD) have improved survival to adulthood from <10% in the 1960's to nearly 90% in the current era. With this shifting demographic, adult CHD (ACHD) patients now outnumber pediatric CHD patients.1 ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits such as impairment in executive function, associated with reduced quality of life that includes deficits in educational attainment and social interaction.2-7 These deficits are related to risk factors that can occur across the lifespan, including genetic abnormalities, cumulative hypoxic/ischemic injury, and, adult-onset atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Our overarching hypothesis is that ACHD patients exhibit vascular brain injury and structural/physiological brain alterations that are predictive of specific neurocognitive deficits, including executive dysfunction, which are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR (e.g., level of education and lifestyle/social habits). We propose an ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD).” We will leverage the MINDS-ACHD parent study data (i.e., NIH Toolbox neuropsychological battery/clinical data/biological samples) and our established neuroimaging harmonization, which we currently use for the PHN Single Ventricle Reconstruction (SVRIII) multi-center brain connectome study (R01-HL128818; PI-Panigrahy), to measure neuroimaging biomarkers in ACHD patients at the same PHN sites. Our specific aims are: Specific Aim #1 (brain injury): To determine if vascular-related brain injury (cortical infarcts, hemosiderin lesions, and white matter hyperintensity) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox total composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #2 (brain structure): To determine if reduced fronto-temporal cortical thickness and white matter connectivity are associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox frontal executive sub-score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #3 (brain physiology): To determine if reduced cerebrovascular reserve (regional cerebral blood flow/ resting BOLD imaging) is associated with specific neurocognitive deficits (e.g. NIH Toolbox crystallized composite score) in ACHD patients. Specific Aim #4 (cognitive reserve): To determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of CR, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. Given the paucity of multi-modal neuroimaging studies in ACHD, our proposed study addresses a major knowledge gap in the ACHD population by providing insight into the mechanism underlying impaired neurocognitive outcomes. Our study will provide structural-physiological correlates of neurocognitive outcomes, representing the first multi-center neuroimaging study to be performed in ACHD. Importantly, other behavioral and environmental enrichment data will be integrated with these neuroimaging and neurocognitive outcome data to model cognitive reserve. Results from this research will help shape the care of ACHD patients, and further our understanding of the interplay between brain injury and cognitive reserve. The proposed ancillary study is thus both feasible and cost-effective by leveraging the NHLBI-PHN infrastructure As such, the proposed research is well aligned with the NHLBI's Strategic Vision. Adult Congenital Heart Disease (ACHD) now outnumber children with CHD. ACHD patients demonstrate domain-specific neurocognitive deficits and reduced quality of life, including lower educational attainment and less social interaction. The mechanism of neurocognitive impairment in the ACHD population is unknown and few neuroimaging studies in this population exist. We propose a multi-modal neuroimaging ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded Pediatric Heart Network (PHN) “Multi-Institutional Neurocognitive Discovery Study” (MINDS) in Adult Congenital Heart Disease to correlate multi-modal neuroimaging biomarkers in relation to neurocognitive outcome. We will also determine if the associations between neuroimaging biomarkers and neurocognitive outcomes in ACHD patients are modified by behavioral and environmental enrichment proxies of cognitive reserve, using traditional statistical models and machine learning techniques. These ACHD studies will foster development of future clinical translational studies or trials of preventive strategies to improve neurocognitive outcome in this population.",MINDS Imaging Ancillary Study,10173881,R01HL152740,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Ancillary Study', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Injuries', 'Caring', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cerebrovascular Trauma', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Common Ventricle', 'Complex', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Educational Background', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Habits', 'Heart', 'Hemosiderin', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life Style', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Abnormality', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Network Infrastructure', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neuropsychology', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevention strategy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Proxy', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Translational trial', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'White Matter Hyperintensity', 'aged', 'brain abnormalities', 'cerebrovascular', 'cognitive reserve', 'cohesion', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'environmental enrichment for laboratory animals', 'executive function', 'hypoxic ischemic injury', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'prevent', 'protective factors', 'randomized trial', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'response', 'social', 'translational study', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,425096
"Novel Cardiac MRI-Based Predictors for Tetralogy of Fallot: Deformation, Kinematic, and Geometric Analyses Five to 10% of patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (rTOF) die before age 30, but our ability to predict which patients will experience death, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation (DVTF) is limited. The optimal timing of pulmonary valve replacement (PVR), which may delay DVTF, is also not clear. The current best predictors of DVTF and guidance for PVR timing rely on “traditional” measures such as right ventricular volume and ejection fraction, which are derived from cardiac MRI (CMR). However, even the best DVTF models have limited predictive power, and these “traditional” volumetric measures fail to predict appropriate response to PVR for 30-40% of patients. This proposal aims to address the critical need for CMR based- metrics that correlate with DVTF and predict response to PVR better than traditional ventricular volumetrics. This will be accomplished through the development of ventricular deformation-, kinematic-, and geometry- based mechanics metrics for rTOF patients from routinely acquired, standard of care CMR datasets, which would allow rapid implementation in clinical practice. The critical need will be addressed through two Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Develop and evaluate novel CMR-based predictors of clinical outcomes in patients with rTOF. Specific Aim 2: Prospectively assess ventricular geometry-based predictors of response to pulmonary valve replacement in rTOF patients. The rationale is that if computational modeling techniques can generate metrics that outperform traditional markers, they can be used to change current patient management with the eventual goal to delay DVTF. The failure to develop improved metrics will lead to continued excess mortality and suboptimal clinical outcomes for patients with rTOF. The combination of cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches allows a more comprehensive assessment of CMR metrics in a population where randomized controlled trials are not feasible. This work has the potential for rapid implementation and thus to mark a paradigm shift in the use of computational modeling in clinical cardiology. The candidate’s career goal is to be an independent investigator leading multidisciplinary research teams to develop new, more accurate, and easily applied outcome predictors for congenital heart disease (CHD). This would place him at the nexus of clinical pediatric cardiology, biomedical engineering, and computer science. To achieve this goal, he will learn about machine learning and kinematic analyses, their strengths and pitfalls, and the data characteristics needed for these analyses. He will learn how to bring his findings to clinical practice and design studies using the newly developed metrics. He will then design R01-funded research to prospectively assess the performance of the ventricular mechanical metrics to guide PVR and predict DVTF. This will all be accomplished through a dedicated, multi-disciplinary mentor/advisor team, a supportive academic environment, and didactic and hands-on training. At the completion of this training, the applicant plans to be a world leader in the application of advanced imaging analytics for congenital heart disease. Project Narrative  The proposed research is relevant to public health because patients with tetralogy of Fallot, the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease affecting ~1:2500 babies, have increased risk of heart failure and premature death despite excellent initial surgery. Development of non-invasive, easily obtained, and rapidly implemented metrics of ventricular mechanics are needed to improve prediction of death and allow optimization of pulmonary valve replacement timing. This project is relevant to the NHLBI’s mission because the tools developed here, and the skills learned, could then be applied to other forms of congenital and structural heart disease, and promote longer and more fulfilling lives for patients.","Novel Cardiac MRI-Based Predictors for Tetralogy of Fallot: Deformation, Kinematic, and Geometric Analyses",10127094,K23HL150279,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac development', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Death Rate', 'Development', 'EFRAC', 'Environment', 'Excess Mortality', 'Failure', 'Funding', 'Gap Junctions', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular Function', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Mentors', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Obstruction', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pediatric cardiology', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Valve Insufficiency', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Right Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tetralogy of Fallot', 'Time', 'Training', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'congenital heart disorder', 'design', 'early experience', 'experience', 'image processing', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'kinematics', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'premature', 'prospective', 'pulmonary valve replacement', 'repaired', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'skills', 'standard of care', 'structural heart disease', 'tool', 'vector']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2021,169351
"Mentoring Patient Oriented Research in Innovative Imaging and High-dimensional Data Approaches to Improve Outcomes in Cardiac Amyloidosis Project Summary/Abstract Dr Sharmila Dorbala is an Associate Professor of Radiology at Harvard Medical School and a physician/scientist at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). She has devoted her career to patient-oriented research focusing on cardiac amyloidosis. She contributed independently to the field of cardiac amyloidosis through a succession of substantive studies utilizing molecular imaging to phenotype cardiac amyloidosis in order to diagnose and manage this condition. Her research program is impactful, both directly and through effective mentoring of the next generation of amyloidosis investigators. Dr. Dorbala has successfully mentored 26 pre- and post-doctoral trainees in patient- oriented research projects. She is currently PI of two active NIH R01 grants and also has funding from AHA and foundation/industrial sources. Her program provides a unique opportunity for POR due to the intersection of resources from programs in clinical investigation at the Harvard School of Public Health and the BWH cardiovascular imaging T32 program. Her mentees have presented their work nationally and internationally, published papers, and won research awards and pilot grants. The new research aims proposed in this award lay the foundation for adjunct interventions to enhance transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) therapies and novel image-based personalized strategies to predict treatment failure. She will assess (1) sonoporation, a therapeutic ultrasound technique to increase myocardial perfusion and, consequently, improve delivery of antifibril drugs; (2) shotgun metagenomic sequencing of the gut microbiome to inform development of nutrition-based adjunct therapies; (3) radiomics of 99mTc- pyrophosphate SPECT/CT to assess treatment response, and (4) machine learning based CT-derived sarcopenia metric to predict survival. This research has important clinical implications. Currently approved TTR stabilizing/silencing drugs, though lifesaving for most, are not effective in about 30% of patients. Moreover, while these therapies improve clinical outcomes, they do not treat amyloid fibril. Fibril-targeted therapies have been unsuccessful to date, probably because of poor interstitial drug delivery due to the presence of fibril. The results of the proposed mentoring and research activities of this K24 project are likely to not only substantially improve outcomes and alleviate HF symptoms in these gravely ill patients, but also transform her patient- oriented research program into a formal individualized program of mentoring with a focus on preventing heart failure from amyloidosis. Project Narrative Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, a particularly deadly form of heart failure, can now be treated by recently developed medications. The proposed projects will develop new heart imaging approaches to determine who is likely to respond to the new medicines, test a new ultrasound-based therapy to improve blood flow to the heart muscle and thereby improve delivery of novel drugs to the heart, and study bacteria in the stool with the goal of eventually developing diet-based strategies to address cardiac amyloidosis. In developing methods to improve treatments for amyloidosis, this project will support expansion of Dr. Dorbala’s patient oriented research program and enhance training for her mentees.",Mentoring Patient Oriented Research in Innovative Imaging and High-dimensional Data Approaches to Improve Outcomes in Cardiac Amyloidosis,10191887,K24HL157648,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Ammonia', 'Amyloid Fibrils', 'Amyloidosis', 'Award', 'Bacteria', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Volume', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diet', 'Diphosphates', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Targeting', 'EFRAC', 'Elderly', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Feces', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'PET/CT scan', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Plant Roots', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prealbumin', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preventive', 'Protein Precursors', 'Proteins', 'Public Health Schools', 'Publishing', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Proposals', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient', 'Symptoms', 'Technical Expertise', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'career', 'clinical investigation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'data registry', 'effective therapy', 'extracellular', 'fecal microbiota', 'follow-up', 'frontier', 'gut microbiome', 'hazard', 'heart imaging', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'interstitial', 'medical schools', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'mid-career faculty', 'molecular imaging', 'mortality', 'multidimensional data', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'nutrition', 'patient oriented research', 'personalized strategies', 'pre-doctoral', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'programs', 'radiomics', 'response', 'sarcopenia', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'sonoporation', 'survival prediction', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'treatment strategy', 'β-amyloid burden']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K24,2021,121599
"Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery PROJECT SUMMARY In the United States over 500,000 cardiac surgeries are performed annually. Postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in ~20% of cardiac surgical patients. Several cohort and registry studies have reported that AKI defined by rise in serum creatinine after cardiac surgery associates with development of chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular events. However, it is unclear which patients will develop long-term adverse kidney events, adverse cardiovascular events, or both. In recent years blood and urine AKI biomarkers have been identified that reflect different aspects of AKI biology and that detect serum creatinine defined AKI earlier than rise in serum creatinine or detect subclinical AKI that is not revealed by traditional serum creatinine assessment. Clinical outcomes and biomarker research has focused mainly on detecting cardiac surgery- associated AKI itself, but not on predicting which patients are at greatest risk for long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after AKI. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that perioperative blood and urine AKI biomarkers significantly associate with increased long-term (2 to 5 years) postoperative major adverse kidney events (MAKE) and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). MAKE is defined as the composite of dialysis, death, renal hospitalization, or ≥ 30 day postoperative eGFR decline >25% from preoperative baseline. MACE is defined as the composite of death or hospitalizations for heart failure, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, arrhythmia, or stroke. We propose a prospective observational cohort study of 610 patients undergoing cardiac surgery at UT Southwestern Medical Center who will be followed for a minimum of 2 years and up to 5 years following cardiac surgery. Based on preliminary data we will assess plasma NT-pro- B-type natriuretic peptide, plasma intact fibroblast growth factor 23, serum cystatin C, urine TIMP-2*IGFBP7, and urine Kidney Injury Molecule-1 AKI biomarkers preoperatively and at 5 postoperative time points. This proposal will address three specific aims: 1) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MAKE during long-term follow-up; 2) To determine the association between in-hospital AKI biomarkers and occurrence of MACE during long-term follow-up; and 3) To develop clinical prediction models for long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. In addition to traditional regression modeling, we will use machine learning that leverages detailed perioperative data including time-varying intraoperative and intensive care unit clinical data and blood and urine AKI biomarker data to create high performing prediction models. Our proposal is significant because knowing what blood and urine AKI biomarkers and clinical parameters accurately predict long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes after cardiac surgery provides the foundation for clinical trials that will identify effective short and long-term interventions for patients at highest risk. Our proposal is innovative because clinical and biomarker data has not been leveraged in this way to predict long-term MAKE and MACE after cardiac surgery. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because combining blood and urine acute kidney injury biomarkers and clinical data to identify cardiac surgical patients at highest risk for long-term major adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes will allow interventional studies to better individualize clinical management to prevent these outcomes. While acute kidney injury after cardiac surgery is associated with increased long-term adverse kidney and cardiovascular outcomes (~25% incidence), it remains unclear which patients with postoperative acute kidney injury are at highest risk. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission to develop fundamental knowledge that can be applied to enhancing health, lengthening life, and reducing illness and disability.",Blood and Urine Biomarkers for Predicting Long-Term Adverse Kidney and Cardiovascular Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery,10161608,R01HL148448,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anesthesiology', 'Angiotensin Receptor', 'Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors', 'Applications Grants', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Biometry', 'Blood', 'Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Cardiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Bypass', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Science', 'Coronary', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Foxes', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Incidence', 'Information Systems', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Intraoperative Care', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nephrology', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Perioperative', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plasma', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Questionnaires', 'Records', 'Registries', 'Regression Analysis', 'Renal function', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Stroke', 'Time', 'Transfusion', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'fibroblast growth factor 23', 'health record', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'post gamma-globulins', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'rat KIM-1 protein']",NHLBI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,787916
"Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT) Project Summary/Abstract: Cardiorespiratory instability (CRI) is common in trauma patients and other acutely ill patients being transferred from trauma sites or between hospital centers. Although paramedics/nurses (PM/RN) have some success in rescuing unstable patients with CRI using defined protocols and decrease incidence of inter-transport severe circulatory shock, the shock recognition tools available and resuscitation endpoints are limited to blood pressure and heart rate thresholds. However, CRI is often unrecognized until it is well established when patients are more refractory to treatment, or progressed to organ injury. If one could accurately predict who, when and why these critically ill patients develop CRI, then effective preemptive treatments could be given to improve care and triage resulting in better use of healthcare resources. We have shown that an integrated monitoring system alert obtained from continuous noninvasively acquired monitoring parameters coupled to a care algorithm improved step-down unit (SDU) patient outcomes. We also applied machine learning (ML) modeling to our clinically-relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to characterize responses to hypovolemia, hemorrhage, and resuscitation, predict which animals would or would not collapse during hypovolemia, and identify occult bleeding 5 minutes earlier than with traditional monitoring. We now propose to apply our work to vulnerable STAT MedEvac air transported patients. We will validate these approaches in our existing >5,000 patient STAT MedEvac database, containing highly granular continuous non-invasive monitoring waveforms of air transported critically ill patients linked to their primary care and inpatient electronic health records (EHR). This level of patient information and granularity linked to treatment data and patient outcomes is unprecedented. We will extend our analysis to include more complex CRI, richer data, deeper analytics, and larger libraries of critically ill patients while in air transport, linking our proven Functional Hemodynamic Monitoring (FHM) principles for pathophysiologic diagnosis and resuscitation with non-invasive monitoring to operationalize personalized resuscitation. We will concurrently running two specific aims. First, we will develop through the Carnegie Melon University Auton Lab multivariable models through ML data-driven classification techniques to predict CRI. We will do this initially on our existing porcine hemorrhagic shock model data (n=60) and then on our STAT MedEvac dataset linked to EHR (n >5,000 patients), determining the minimal data (measures, sampling frequency, observation duration) required to robustly identify deviation from health, likely CRI cause, and response to treatment (endpoint of resuscitation), as well as the incremental benefit of additional variables, analysis, lead-time and sampling frequency to predict CRI and response to treatment, and examine the trade-offs between model parsimony and specificity. Second, we will evaluate our existing clinical decision support (CDS) tools to interface with FHM principles and ML- defined interactions, and trial this in silico first on our porcine hemorrhagic shock resuscitation, then on our STAT MedEvac data, followed by prospective human simulation on flight crew PM/RN (n=160) during annual training for agreement and benefit, defining effectiveness based on diagnosis accuracy, time to diagnosis, intervention choice accuracy and time to intervention. This iterative process will modify the existing CDS platform into one more specifically suited for air transport scenarios. Finally, we will evaluate the resultant semi-autonomous management protocol initially in retrospect in 100 STAT MedEvac patients and 10 Emergency Department trauma patients and then prospectively by active CDS in a final 100 STAT MedEvac patients. We will prospectively analyze the effectiveness of these calibrated CDS tools for predictive ability of the various ML models and apply the best, most practical and parsimonious predictive models for clinical care during transport based on patient population, pathological processes and support staff. Project narrative We propose to develop and trial of proactive approach to diagnosis and management of vulnerable critically ill patients during STAT MedEvac air transport from trauma sites and inter-hospital transfer. We will use machine learning approaches to plumb our existing rich >5500 patient STAT MedEvac waveform data linked to their electronic health records to define level of severity, predict impending cardiovascular instability and to both drive in-flight resuscitation and alert receiving Emergency Department triage. We will use our existing clinically relevant porcine model of hemorrhagic shock to focus initial human instability algorithms and then refine our existing graph user interface clinical decisions support (CDS) algorithm, first in animal and with paramedic/nurse dyads in human simulation and then during actual STAT MedEvac air transport and Emergency Department care of trauma patients creating a scalable CDS platform to support paramedic/nurse smart monitoring and proactive resuscitation of these high risk patients.",Autonomous diagnosis and management of the critically ill during air transport (ADMIT),10141287,R01HL141916,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Agreement', 'Air', 'Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Environment', 'Family suidae', 'Frequencies', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Heart Rate', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic Shock', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Hypovolemia', 'Incidence', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical', 'Melons', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Normal Range', 'Nurses', 'Organ failure', 'Paramedical Personnel', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Records', 'Refractory', 'Resources', 'Resuscitation', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serious Adverse Event', 'Severities', 'Shock', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Hemorrhage', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weaning', 'Work', 'advanced system', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data modeling', 'data streams', 'demographics', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'in silico', 'indexing', 'insight', 'iterative design', 'mortality', 'non-invasive monitor', 'organ injury', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'simulation', 'success', 'support tools', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,652539
"AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by hearing loss, visual impairment, and in some cases, vestibular dysfunction. It is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness in humans. USH causes extensive degeneration in the cochlear nerve (CN), especially in CN fibers innervating the base of the cochlea. Whereas there is no treatment for arresting this degenerative process or for restoring visual loss, the restoration of auditory input is possible with cochlear implantation. Due to the progressive deterioration in vision, using visual cues for communication will eventually become impossible. Therefore, the importance of optimizing auditory inputs through cochlear implants (CIs) for patients with USH is paramount. However, patients with USH have much higher rates of neurological, mental, or behavioral disorders than the general CI patient population, which limits their ability to provide reliable behavioral responses or sufficient verbal descriptions of their auditory perception, especially for pediatric patients. In addition, optimal programming parameters for CI users with CN damage differ from those used in typical CI users due to declined CN responsiveness to electrical stimulation. As a result, the clinical programming process in implanted patients with USH can be extremely challenging. To date, auditory neural encoding of electrical stimulation in patients with USH has not been systematically evaluated. Consequently, the field lacks evidence-based practice guidelines for managing implanted patients with USH. For patients who cannot provide reliable feedback, clinicians rely on a “trial-and-error” approach for adjusting CI programming settings, which ultimately may not result in appropriate programming maps for individual patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop objective clinical tools for optimizing CI settings for these patients. As the first step toward developing evidence-based practice for managing patients with USH, this study evaluates local neural health, as well as the neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN in implanted patients with USH. Aim 1 will determine local CN health in patients with USH by assessing the sensitivity of the electrically evoked compound action potential to changes in interphase gap and pulse polarity. Aim 2 will determine group differences in neural encoding of temporal and spectral cues at the CN between patients with USH and patients with idiopathic hearing loss. Aim 3 will use supervised machine learning techniques to develop an objective tool for assessing the electrode-neuron interface at individual electrode locations. Results of this study have high scientific significance because they will establish how CN degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, and identify tests that distinguish the loss of spiral ganglion neurons from the loss of peripheral axons. Results of this study also have high clinical significance because they will 1) lay the groundwork for developing effective, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for managing patients with USH, and 2) yield an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neuron interface in all CI users, which is foundational for creating optimal programming maps for individual patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health because it aims to better understand neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation in patients with Usher syndrome (USH) – an autosomal recessive disorder that is the leading cause of hereditary deaf-blindness. Results from this study will have a broad impact on the field by 1) establishing how cochlear nerve degeneration affects neural encoding and processing of electrical stimulation, 2) identifying tests that distinctly evaluate the loss in the spiral ganglion cells vs the loss in the peripheral axon, and 3) yielding an objective tool for assessing the site-specific electrode-neural interface in all cochlear implant users. Results from this study will also have a targeted impact on implanted patients with USH by laying the groundwork for developing an effective, evidence-based clinical practice for managing these patients. This project is relevant to the mission of NIH because it seeks fundamental knowledge about the nature of electrical hearing in patients with USH and strives to apply this knowledge to reduce disability in all patients with cochlear implants.",AUDITORY NEURAL FUNCTION IN IMPLANTED PATIENTS WITH USHER SYNDROME,10192995,R21DC019458,"['Accounting', 'Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Auditory', 'Auditory Perception', 'Auditory system', 'Axon', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Blindness', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Cochlea', 'Cochlear Implants', 'Cochlear Nerve', 'Cochlear implant procedure', 'Communication', 'Cues', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Deterioration', 'Disease', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electrodes', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Evidence based practice', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gap Junctions', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Interphase', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Fibers', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Practice Management', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery of Function', 'Refractory', 'Research', 'Retinitis Pigmentosa', 'Sensorineural Hearing Loss', 'Site', 'Speech', 'Speech Perception', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Usher Syndrome', 'Vision', 'Visual', 'Visual impairment', 'axonal degeneration', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'daily functioning', 'deaf', 'disability', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'ganglion cell', 'hearing impairment', 'histological studies', 'individual patient', 'model development', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuron loss', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'point of care', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'restoration', 'spiral ganglion', 'supervised learning', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,196406
"In Vivo Cluster AI Prediction (CLAIRE) of COVID-19 Disease Progression ABSTRACT The coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, which early this year forced entire countries into lockdown, has reached a global death toll of 890,000+ by early September 2020. Based on the high number of COVID-19 cases that are asymptomatic but infectious, an estimated reproductive rate of infection of about 2 and a high mutation rate, it is expected that the virus will remain in the population as the influenza virus does. For hospitals serving areas whose economy relies on international travel, tourism, and cruise ship tourism, such as Miami-Dade county, new COVID-19 cases related to travel will require treatment during infection outbreaks which will strain health systems, especially during the infectious respiratory disease season in the winter. Patient risk factors during the current COVID-19 outbreak as well as during other viral outbreaks, such as seasonal influenza, are poorly characterized, consequently negatively affecting patient care. The saliva microbiome, which includes viruses and bacteria, is not currently used as in diagnostic tools. However, it may reveal risk factors associated with severe disease and/or a fatal outcome, and it allows for the detection and study of the viral RNA sequence for potential contact tracing and molecular epidemiology, all of which affect both vaccine and antiviral efficacy. In this proposed study, Lifetime Omics will develop CLAIRE, a proof-of-concept in vivo cluster AI platform for predicting disease progression of viral infectious respiratory diseases such as COVID-19 through the analysis of the saliva metagenome. The University of Miami Medical Group Infection Control (UMMGIC) division will collaborate in this effort by collecting saliva samples from COVID-19 patients with de-identified clinical information. The samples will undergo metagenomic sequencing and Lifetime Omics will repurpose algorithms used for prediction of in vivo HIV evolution to perform genetic/phylogenetic analysis on SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences, estimating mutation rate and immune selection pressures and identifying both the in vivo quasispecies clusters and the geographic cluster to which the patient belongs. The CLAIRE models will be trained with public datasets and tested on the metagenomic sequences generated from saliva samples of UMMGIC patients with the goal of assisting physicians in predicting disease progression in COVID-19. NARRATIVE During the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is difficult for physicians admitting new patients to the hospital to distinguish patients whose disease will be mild from those who will have a severe disease progression. While this can also occur with the seasonal flu and other infectious respiratory diseases, the degree of severity seen in COVID-19, the potential of accelerated deterioration, and the high pressure on hospital resources for extended periods of time present a compelling and urgent need to better understand and anticipate the risk factors that may drive severe disease. Lifetime Omics is developing CLAIRE, a viral cluster AI system for prediction of infectious respiratory disease progression, such as COVID-19, using metagenomics and AI to provide personalized information to inform treatment decisions, help improve outcomes, and better utilize healthcare resources.",In Vivo Cluster AI Prediction (CLAIRE) of COVID-19 Disease Progression,10256828,R43EB030947,"['2019-nCoV', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bacteria', 'Biological Markers', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 outbreak', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cessation of life', 'China', 'Cities', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Contact Tracing', 'Coronavirus', 'Country', 'County', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Sensitivity', 'Disease', 'Disease Outbreaks', 'Disease Progression', 'Evolution', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'HIV', 'Health system', 'Hospitals', 'Immune', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Influenza', 'International', 'Lifting', 'Lung diseases', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metagenomics', 'Microbe', 'Minor', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patient Care', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Primary Infection', 'Process', 'Quarantine', 'RNA Sequences', 'ROC Curve', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 positive', 'Saliva', 'Sampling', 'Seasons', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Severities', 'Ships', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Travel', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'anti-viral efficacy', 'base', 'co-infection', 'computerized tools', 'data modeling', 'health care service utilization', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'infection rate', 'influenzavirus', 'markov model', 'metagenome', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'negative affect', 'outcome forecast', 'pathogen', 'pathogenic bacteria', 'patient subsets', 'phase 1 study', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'pressure', 'reproductive', 'saliva analysis', 'saliva sample', 'seasonal influenza', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'vaccine efficacy', 'viral RNA']",NIBIB,"LIFETIME OMICS, INC.",R43,2021,248723
"Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records Project Summary A key aim of this proposal is to equip the candidate, Dr.Ozrazgat Baslanti, with the necessary protected time and additional training and resources to develop her skillset on quantitative methods and understanding of underlying mechanism of progression of kidney disease and facilitate her transition to an independent translational researcher in health care. The long-term career goal is to become an independent data scientist, with a focus on hospital care for acute disease and complications arising from that care. The overall objective of this application is to build the foundation of the analytical approach for identifying patients’ health trajectories during episode of acute hospitalization and quantifying the transitions in health states that can be applied to any acute illness. Our central hypothesis is that using kidney health as a paradigm for this approach we can determine individual states of change in kidney health during hospitalization using longitudinal, highly granular temporal data in electronic health records, determine transition probabilities to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease, and improve understanding of the underlying processes influencing these transitions. Current diagnosis and risk evaluation for acute kidney injury (AKI) are focused on determination of severity of AKI episode and an integrated framework for assessing renal recovery does not exist. There is a clear lack of research on estimating transition probabilities among different states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using longitudinal electronic health records data. The complexity of underlying processes influencing the transition probabilities from renal risk to more severe stages of acute and chronic kidney disease requires application of advanced computational models in sufficiently large and granular datasets. The specific aims of the proposal are: Aim 1- Expand and validate computable phenotypes of kidney health in large-scale medical data. Aim 2- Determine the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of changes in kidney health. Aim 3- Develop and validate probabilistic graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health and identify risk factors for progression. The proposed research is significant as we will have phenotyping algorithms of kidney health, validated in multi-center study, that can enhance their inter-institutional sharing and that enable to study epidemiology and outcomes of changes in kidney health. The approach is innovative because it implements technological advances in data science and statistics in innovative steps to develop and validate a phenotyping algorithm that determines computable phenotypes of changes in kidney health and graphical models to predict transition through the states of kidney health through nonlinear and non-normal time- dependent domains using highly granular electronic health records. This will provide foundation for changes in the care of patients with AKI, through identification of those patients at risk of developing AKI and progressing to acute and chronic kidney disease. On completion of the proposed investigations the deliverables will be new knowledge and a diagnosis and prognostication tool for kidney health. Project Narrative Acute kidney injury (AKI) is one of the most common complication among hospitalized patients and is central to the subsequent development of chronic kidney disease and increased mortality. Besides the severity of an initial episode of acute kidney injury, the timing and duration of renal recovery are required to characterize the natural history of this complex condition and its effect on overall kidney health. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH’s mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge that will help to enhance health, since our research may provide diagnosis and prediction tools for changes in kidney health using electronic records data that contain wealth of clinical data that could be used to identify all dimensions of AKI episode as well as key determinants of undesired outcomes.",Development and Validation of Computational Algorithms to Assess Kidney Health in Electronic Health Records,10141224,K01DK120784,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Admission activity', 'Algorithms', 'Award', 'Bayesian Network', 'Caring', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Complication', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural History', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Preventive therapy', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Records', 'Recovery', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'acute care', 'adjudication', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'career', 'computable phenotypes', 'data repository', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'inter-institutional', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'prognostic tool', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'translational scientist']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2021,129110
"QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Individuals receiving maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have exceedingly high mortality, driven largely by cardiovascular events. The rate of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the HD population exceeds that of the general population by more than 20-fold. Risk factors for SCD such as structural heart disease and conduction abnormalities are common among people with end-stage kidney disease, but traditional preventive strategies, such as antiarrhythmic medications and implantable cardioverter defibrillators, do not lower SCD risk in HD patients. However, medication-provoked SCD may be preventable, and, to-date, has been understudied in HD patients. Dialysis patients are often prescribed medications that have the undesirable, off-target effect of delayed ventricular repolarization, which manifests as QT-interval prolongation on an electrocardiogram, and can trigger fatal arrhythmias. Although more than 50% of dialysis patients are prescribed medications that can prolong the QT-interval (e.g. certain antidepressants, antibiotics, antiemetics), there are critical knowledge gaps about the cardiac safety of these medications. In fact, their safety profiles rest on data obtained from healthy volunteers and have not been explicitly evaluated in HD patients. By executing the proposed studies, we will provide a comprehensive understanding of the essential safety data relevant to the prescription of non- cardiac QT-prolonging medications to HD patients. In Aim 1, we will determine the relative SCD risk of the most commonly prescribed non-cardiac medications with higher QT-prolonging potential vs. clinically relevant comparator medications with lower QT-prolonging potential among HD patients. In Aim 2, we will identify modifiable clinical factors (e.g. dialysate composition and concurrent prescription medications) that may be targeted to mitigate SCD risk from QT-prolonging medications. In Aim 3, we will identify prescribers of higher risk QT-prolonging medications and associated encounters that should prompt medication reconciliation and decision support tool use. Then, in Aim 4, we will develop individualized decision support tools for QT- prolonging medication prescribing that integrate many comorbid conditions, HD treatment, and medication- related risk factors. This work will yield decision support tools that facilitate personalized SCD risk assessments and safer prescribing of QT-prolonging medications to reduce SCD risk among HD patients. Moreover, the decision support tools generated in this project will serve as the subject of future pragmatic trials testing the impact of tool implementation on cardiovascular outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Hemodialysis patients experience a disproportionately high burden of sudden cardiac death. Medication- provoked sudden cardiac death (i.e. death triggered by QT-prolonging medications) may be preventable and has not been studied enough in this population. Our project aims to uncover medication-related risk factors for sudden cardiac death and develop clinical decision support tools that will promote safer medication prescribing.",QT prolonging medications and sudden cardiac death among individuals on hemodialysis,10127698,R01HL152034,"['Antibiotics', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Antiemetics', 'Arrhythmia', 'Benefits and Risks', 'Biometry', 'Calcium', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Dialysis patients', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Drug Interactions', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrolytes', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Care', 'End stage renal failure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Hemodialysis', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medicare', 'Observational Study', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Polypharmacy', 'Population', 'Potassium', 'Prevention strategy', 'Publishing', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk-Benefit Assessment', 'Safety', 'Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor', 'Testing', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'healthy volunteer', 'high risk', 'implementation tool', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication safety', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'personalized decision', 'point of care', 'pragmatic trial', 'structural heart disease', 'sudden cardiac death', 'support tools']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2021,509050
"Improving Outcomes Assessment in Chronic Graft versus Host Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) can cure many hematologic cancers and other life- threatening hematologic diseases but 20-50% of survivors develop chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD), the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant survivors. Chronic GVHD is an iatrogenic complication that can affect multiple organs, leading to clinical manifestations similar to autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren’s syndrome, and lichen planus. Chronic GVHD requires prolonged treatment with potent immunosuppressive agents and is associated with high symptom burden and poor quality of life. The precise pathophysiology is unclear in humans. There are data supporting involvement of T and B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, cytokines, chemokines and other proteins. However, information is derived from studies with few patients having heterogeneous clinical manifestations. This renewal application will address key gaps in our understanding: Can we identify biologically relevant cGVHD subgroups by studying large numbers of patients and using sophisticated analytic techniques to identify “clusters” of similar patients? Is personalized medicine possible based on knowledge of underlying pathophysiology and the likelihood of response? To address these questions, we will use our extensive biorepository to test whether plasma proteins and peripheral blood cellular populations cluster with clinical manifestations. While these studies are ongoing, a new cohort will be enrolled to prospectively test the cluster findings and to investigate early biomarkers for treatment response. Participants will be enrolled prior to starting a new systemic initial or second-line cGVHD treatment, then followed at 1, 3 and 6 months later to assess clinical response. Successful completion of these aims will advance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of the different forms of human cGVHD and guide therapeutic approaches, in order to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this common transplant complication. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is the leading cause of morbidity and non-relapse mortality in survivors of allogeneic transplantation. Our understanding of the biologic abnormalities associated with different clinical phenotypes is lacking, preventing our ability to rationally choose cGVHD treatments.

"Racial/Ethnic Disparities in Heart Failure: A Cross Cohort Collaboration ABSTRACT Heart failure (HF), and its subtypes defined by preserved (HFpEF), reduced (HFrEF) or mid-range (HFmrEF) ejection fraction are a major and growing public health problem. The long term goal of this project is to better understand the health disparities regarding HF and define effective preventive measures that may reduce these disparities. We propose to pool data from 10 large longitudinal cohort studies to examine race/ethnic and sex disparities in developing HF, its subtypes, and its prognosis. The harmonized data will include over 130,028 men and women with over 8975 similarly-adjudicated prospective HF outcomes, representing a wide spectrum of ages, race/ethnicities, and geographic regions of the United States. This cross-cohort collaboration will provide a unique opportunity to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of sex and racial/ethnic health disparities in HF. Causal mediation analysis techniques will be used to estimate the degree to which single and multi-factor lifestyle and clinical interventions could potentially reduce health disparities in HF. In our phenomapping aim, we will define unique clinically relevant phenotypes of HF based upon cohort data that is also commonly present in medical records for enhanced generalizability, including age, race/ethnicity, sex, clinical signs, symptoms, biomarkers, ejection fraction, physiologic measures, and co-morbidities; we will also evaluate HF phenotype associations with CVD and all-cause mortality.

"Precision antimicrobial stewardship for Clostridioides difficile prevention (PASTCDI) Project Summary Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an important healthcare-associated infection and a significant driver of poor patient outcomes and preventable cost. An existing bundle of antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) methods of CDI prevention are limited by difficulties identifying high-risk patients most likely to benefit from interventions. Recently we have developed a machine learning classification tool capable of accurately identify risk of developing CDI in hospitalized patients. Here we propose adding and rigorously testing this highly innovative precision medicine approach to CDI prevention within a robust, real-world AMS infrastructure Objective: To decrease CDI incidence by implementing an electronic health record-integrated CDI-risk classification tool within a framework of precision-medicine AMS. Specific Aim: Measure the effect of implementing a real-time CDI-risk classification tool to guide AMS efforts for CDI prevention among high-risk patients. The primary outcome will be hospital-associated CDI incidence. We will measure outcomes in patients identified as high-risk by the risk classification tool, comparing a 24- month pre-implementation period with a 12-month post-implementation period using interrupted time series (ITS) segmented regression. Secondary outcomes will include antimicrobial utilization rates, CDI test ordering, hospital length of stay, total cost, tool use, and AMS satisfaction Hypothesis: We hypothesize that tool implementation will result in a 35% relative reduction in CDI incidence, which aligns well with the lower end of estimates of bundle effect in prior studies. Significance: While evidence supports the efficacy of AMS interventions for CDI-prevention in general, our proposal is the first to our knowledge to employ a precision-medicine approach to CDI prevention. This high- impact, precision medicine proposal, based on extensive, sound preliminary data has a high probability of success. Project Narrative Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is an epidemic in hospitalized patients, and current prevention strategies are limited by difficulties identifying patients most likely to benefit from interventions.

"Early detection, containment, and management of COVID-19 in dialysis facilities using multi-modal data sources Abstract With older age and multiple comorbidities, dialysis patients are at high risk for serious complications, even death, from COVID-19. There is a large disproportionate representation of minorities, especially Blacks and Hispanics. Over 85% of hemodialysis patients travel three times a week to dialysis facilities to receive life-sustaining treatments and cannot shelter in place. There is a critical need to characterize COVID-19 transmission pathways in dialysis patients and clinics, identify potential coronavirus carriers, and develop procedures to curb the spread. With regular medical encounters, a large amount of data has been collected for each patient over time. These data have not been fully utilized for COVID-19 prediction and control in dialysis clinics. In this proposal, we seek to leverage demographic, clinical, treatment, laboratory, socioeconomic, serological, metabolomic, wearable and machine-integrated sensors, and COVID-19 surveillance data to develop mathematical and statistical models and implement them in a large number of dialysis clinics. The mathematical and statistical modeling using multiple data resources will help us understand how COVID-19 spread in dialysis facilities, identify potential COVID-19 patients before symptoms appear, and identify potential asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. We will develop novel mathematical and statistical models that fully utilize the high dimensional multimodal data available to us and other dialysis providers. We capitalize on the intrinsic advantages of hemodialysis clinics to implement and validate the proposed prediction models. We firmly believe that this cross-disciplinary effort will improve patients’ and staff’s safety while delivering high-quality, individualized care to a high-risk population.

"Impact of Disparities Affecting Survival among Advanced Heart Failure Patients and Transplant Recipients DESCRIPTION: The current heart transplant allocation system and the newly recommended one prioritizes patients based on waitlist survival and does not take into account risk of death after transplant or likelihood of transplantation. Furthermore, it defines medical urgency for transplantation mainly by use of devices and not by objective evidence of medical illness. Unfortunately, many heart failure patients die on the waitlist, including a disproportionate number of women, Hispanics, and patients with certain heart diseases like restrictive cardiomyopathy. After transplantation there are also survival disparities. The long-term goal of this project is to optimize timing for advanced heart failure therapy in order to improve survival and minimize organ wastage. The objective of this research application is to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation and to create tools that will improve outcome in therapy while minimizing organ wastage. The central hypothesis is that a better heart transplant allocation system requires knowledge of how population differences affect patient selection, waitlist mortality, and post-transplant mortality. The rationale for the proposed research is that there are known disparities (sex, race, and type of heart disease) in survival among advanced heart failure patients (pre- and post-transplantation) and creation of risk prediction models have successfully reduced waitlist mortality for lung, liver, and kidney transplantation. The specific aims of this research proposal are: 1) to identify risk factors for disparities in survival among heart transplant candidates and post-transplantation using the national transplant database 2) to develop a method to dynamically update risk of waitlist mortality across time using data from multiple transplant centers that includes potential prognistic risk factors not available in our national transplant database and 3) to create a mathematical model that simultaneous estimates waitlist and post-transplant mortality to optimize timing of transplantation. The approach is innovative because it utilizes new mathematical approaches and seeks to shift current heart failure research and clinical practice paradigms by taking into account population differences rather than basing decisions solely on ejection fraction, presence of coronary artery disease, and stages of disease. The proposed research is significant, because few studies have explored population differences in advanced heart failure to determine the factors associated with mortality on the waitlist and poor outcome post-transplantation. This proposal will evaluate the complex interplay of population differences (i.e sex, race, type of heart disease, laboratory measures of organ dysfunction, and influences of co-morbidities) as they relate to mortality on the waitlist, timing of transplantation, and mortality after transplantation. If the aims of our proposal are achieved, our research has the potential to empower clinicians and researchers to provide the right therapies for the right patient at the right time. There are disparities in survival among patients on the waiting list for a heart transplant, and post-transplantation. These differences are not recognized by the current and newly recommended heart transplant allocation system.

"Prediction of imminent sudden cardiac death based on warning signs Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), a sudden catastrophic loss of the pulse, affects >350,000 in the US annually. Most will suffer sudden cardiac death (SCD) within 10 minutes of presentation, yielding a mortality rate >90%. Based on our recent work, we have proposed a novel paradigm for SCD called “near-term prevention”. SCA is often not as sudden as one might expect. At least 50% of individuals will have warning symptoms at some time in the 4 weeks prior to SCD, but these can be non-specific, so are often not acted upon. The overall goal of this proposal is to refine the identification of the symptomatic individual at high-risk of SCD, during this 4-week window of opportunity. We propose that a simultaneous examination of symptoms, clinical factors and biomarkers may identify individuals at highest risk of imminent SCD, which could enable prediction and pre-emptive management, thereby preventing SCD. We are proposing to develop a comprehensive risk score from two population-based studies founded by the PI. The Portland, Oregon Sudden Unexpected Death Study (Oregon-SUDS, catchment area ≈ 1 million) is now in its 17th year and the Ventura, California PRESTO study (Prediction of Sudden Death in Multi-Ethnic Communities, catchment area ≈ 850,000) is in its 5th year. The resulting combined databank contains information on >7500 SCD cases and controls, with detailed clinical phenotyping and a biobank of plasma samples. From Oregon-SUDS, we recently reported that 51% (n=430) of 839 individuals who suffered SCD presented with at least one symptom within the 4 weeks prior to their lethal event. The main symptom was chest pain, but dyspnea, fatigue, syncope and palpitations were also recorded. Warning signs could represent an opportunity for near-term prediction of SCD. While these symptoms are common and may be non-specific for SCD, we hypothesize that a combination of specific symptoms and clinical profile could facilitate the identification of patients at high risk of impending SCA. In addition, the discovery of novel plasma biomarkers for SCD could have additional utility for risk stratification. We therefore hypothesize that biomarkers, when combined with specific symptoms and clinical profile, will maximize the likelihood of identifying symptomatic subjects at highest risk of SCD, allowing for early intervention. SCD remains a major public health problem with a critical need for novel prediction and prevention. Development of this user-friendly risk score for imminent SCD in those with warning symptoms would represent a practical and clinically meaningful advance for triage of patients for optimal care. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is a public health problem of substantial magnitude and at least fifty percent of affected individuals have warning signs in the four weeks preceding their event. The overall goal of this proposal is to develop a comprehensive risk prediction score for imminent SCD in those that have warning signs, in order to improve the effectiveness of SCD prevention.",Prediction of imminent sudden cardiac death based on warning signs,10119320,R01HL147358,"['911 call', 'Affect', 'Archives', 'Biological Markers', 'California', 'Caring', 'Catchment Area', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Control Groups', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dyspnea', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Event', 'Family', 'Fatigue', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Oregon', 'Palpitations', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Plasma', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Subgroup', 'Sudden Death', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Syncope', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Wireless Technology', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'case control', 'circulating biomarkers', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'common symptom', 'community living', 'data repository', 'design', 'high risk', 'improved', 'lipidomics', 'men', 'mortality', 'novel', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'sex', 'specific biomarkers', 'sudden cardiac death', 'user-friendly']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,800448
"Novel mechanisms and treatment of arrhythmia during resuscitation Resuscitation from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is typically initiated in patients with ongoing ischemia and ventricular fibrillation (VF) or tachycardia (VT) that, even if successful, is commonly followed by repeated rearrest. Despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, survival remains poor prompting NIH to identify resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research. Beat-to-beat alternans of cellular repolarization in the myocardium (repolarization alternans) is a substrate for arrhythmias, is rampant during resuscitation, and is manifested on the ECG as T-wave oscillations that can alternate (2:1) or as more complex oscillations. In preliminary studies, we observed in resuscitation patients and in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation from SCA, that rearrest due to VT/VF is preceded by T-wave oscillations that are complex; whereas, rearrest due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) is preceded by increased T-wave oscillations that alternate. Accordingly, we contend that when T-wave oscillations are complex, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially discordant, which is repolarization alternans occurring out-of-phase in adjacent regions and is highly arrhythmogenic. In contrast, when T-wave oscillations alternate, repolarization alternans in the myocardium is spatially in-phase (concordant), which poses no known immediate arrhythmia risk but is associated with mechanical dysfunction and, thus, PEA. Finally, in the absence of any repolarization alternans, risk of rearrest due to PEA or VT/VF is low. We hypothesize that during resuscitation rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA is strongly linked to repolarization alternans in the myocardium that is spatially discordant or not, respectively, and that specifically targeting the underlying mechanisms can prevent rearrest due to VT/VF and, possibly, PEA. In addition, the full spectrum of ECG T-wave oscillations can be utilized to predict no rearrest and rearrest from VT/VF or PEA and, thus, be used in the future as a biomarker to guide therapy and significantly improve outcomes. Our hypotheses will be tested with the following aims. 1) Determine the mechanistic relationship between cellular repolarization alternans and rearrest due to VT/VF or PEA in an in vivo model of resuscitation. 2) Determine if targeting the mechanisms of repolarization alternans can prevent rearrest during resuscitation, thereby gaining additional mechanistic insight. 3) Develop and test an ECG biomarker for predicting risk of rearrest due to VT/VF and PEA in resuscitation patients. To achieve these aims, we will utilize sophisticated instrumentation and signal processing in an in vivo translational model of resuscitation as well as in pre-hospital and in- hospital resuscitation patients. We have also established a highly translational collaboration that combines expertise in emergency medicine, cardiac arrhythmia, and clinical electrophysiology. Our scientific environment provides a unique opportunity to develop a better understanding of arrhythmia mechanisms relevant to resuscitation in order to develop novel and effective therapies. Project Narrative Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) due to arrhythmia is a major public health problem and despite significant efforts to improve resuscitation from SCA, rearrest and survival remain poor. Consequently, improved approaches are needed, and NIH has recently identified resuscitation as a high priority for emergency care research.

Understanding the mechanism through model systems of preconditioning would help us identify the genes and proteins when designing future drug targets for the prevention of ischemic cardiac injury. As a promising alternative to electrical pacing to modulate heart rate, optogenetic pacing does not require physical contact, has high spatial and temporal precision, offers more specific excitation, and avoids artifacts from electrical stimulation. Recent developments in the field of optogenetics make it possible for non-invasive and specific optical control of the heart rhythm in animal models, such as in Drosophila melanogaster. Drosophila is a powerful genetic model system that has been used since the early 1900s to characterize genes associated with human diseases, including cardiac diseases. Studies performed in flies can provide insights into conserved mechanisms in cardiac diseases, which can be applied to higher organisms, including humans. Working in collaboration with Drs. Airong Li and Rudolph Tanzi from the Massachusetts General Hospital, we demonstrated non-invasive optogenetic pacing and concurrent optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the Drosophila heart for the first time. Recently, we further demonstrated red-light optogenetic pacing and successful optical control of tachycardia, bradycardia, and restorable cardiac arrest in fly models. Building on the decade-long productive collaboration with Drs. Li and Tanzi and new collaborations with Dr. Abhinav Diwan (cardiologist) and Dr. Jeanne Nerbonne (cardiac electrophysiologist) and Dr. Kenneth Schechtman (biostatistician) at Washington University, we propose to develop a high-throughput integrated OCT imaging and dual-color optogenetic pacing system and establish a novel research platform to study preconditioning and hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart. We hypothesize that periods of bradypacing will precondition the fly heart to protect against hypoxia, via activation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. The specific aims are: 1) Develop and optimize a high-throughput integrated instrument for non-invasive OCT imaging and optogenetic control of fly heart function in vivo; 2) Develop double transgenic fly models and functional assays based on OCT imaging to characterize fly heart physiology in vivo; 3) Define functional and molecular changes in response to hypoxia and optogenetic preconditioning in transgenic fly models. If successful, the high-throughput optical imaging and dual-color optogenetic pacing platform developed in this program combined with powerful double transgenic fly models will enable us to characterize changes of the fly heart function in response to different stress challenges that is not feasible before. This will allow us to perform a series of new experiments, providing insights into conserved molecular mechanisms on hypoxia-induced cardiac changes and preconditioning. Project Narrative We will develop a novel research platform to noninvasively image and control heart function in fly models. Tachycardia, bradycardia and cardiac arrest will be stimulated using light and the cardioprotective effects of preconditioning will be explored. The new knowledge and novel insights gleaned from these studies will advance our understanding of conserved molecular mechanisms on hypoxia-induced changes in the heart and ischemic preconditioning.",High-throughput integrated live imaging and optogenetic pacing platform to assess hypoxia responsiveness in the fly heart,10132500,R01HL156265,"['Abdomen', 'Aging', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Models', 'Bradycardia', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Function Study', 'Collaborations', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Drug Targeting', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Future', 'Gene Proteins', 'General Hospitals', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Glean', 'Heart', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intelligence', 'Ion Channel', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Preconditioning', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Lysosomes', 'Massachusetts', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Names', 'Opsin', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Oranges', 'Organism', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiology', 'Prevention', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Science', 'Series', 'Side', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Tachycardia', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Organisms', 'Tube', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'base', 'cardioprotection', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart rhythm', 'human disease', 'image processing', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'instrument', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'optogenetics', 'preconditioning', 'programs', 'real-time images', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'segmentation algorithm', 'tool']",NHLBI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,529434
"Inflammatory and Metabolic Biomarkers in Cardiovascular Complications with SARS-CoV-2 One of the most poorly understood yet clinically important aspects of the novel COVID-19 SARS CoV2 coronavirus is the marked heterogeneity that it displays with infection severity and with development of end organ complications and mortality. SARS CoV-2 infection has a complex epidemiologic interplay with cardiovascular (CVD) and highlights this complex heterogeneity. The biology underlying this heterogeneity in CVD outcomes is poorly understood and concomitantly, clinically useful biomarkers do not currently exist to identify the highest risk patients in need of the most intense monitoring. Thus, we propose to use integrated omics and EHR data in a diverse multi-center North Carolina cohort with existing biological specimens to determine the role of inflammation, metabolism and novel molecular mechanisms, and identify biomarkers of CVD outcomes in patients with COVID-19. We propose to (1) Determine the clinical predictors of infection severity in a diverse population of individuals with CVD risk factors and SARS-CoV2 infection including evaluation of racial differences; (2) Determine the role of inflammatory, SARS-CoV-2 related, and other candidate proteins as biomarkers of infection severity and CVD outcomes in patients with SARS CoV-2 infection; and (3) Evaluate metabolic pathways in SARS Co-V-2 infection severity and CVD outcomes. The proposal has high potential for dissecting the molecular mechanisms of the heterogeneity between CVD and SARS CoV-2 outcomes. Importantly, it has great short-term potential for clinically important results that will lead to earlier and better identification of high-risk patients for more intensive monitoring; novel therapeutic interventions to prevent end organ complications and mortality; and diagnostic and disease-progression biomarkers. As the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed, it is emerging that patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and pre-existing CVD appear to have a worse severity of infection. Furthermore, CVD complications appear to be relatively common in patients with COVID-19 regardless of pre-existing CVD. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict who will develop the most severe infection and who will develop CVD complications. Technologies have evolved such that hundreds of proteins and other markers and millions of genetic markers can be rapidly measured in small amounts of blood. Thus, in this proposal, we will use these cutting-edge technologies in blood samples collected from patients with COVID-19 from two large medical centers in North Carolina, to identify biomarkers that can tell us those patients who will have the most severe infections and those patients who have suffer CVD complications, as well as identifying the genes that may predispose patients to these complications.",Inflammatory and Metabolic Biomarkers in Cardiovascular Complications with SARS-CoV-2,10303644,R21AI158786,"['2019-nCoV', 'ACE2', 'Angiotensins', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'COVID-19 patient', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Coronavirus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inpatients', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolism', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'North Carolina', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predisposition', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severities', 'Specimen', 'Technology', 'Universities', 'Work', 'biobank', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'fatty acid oxidation', 'high risk', 'improved', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'prevent', 'progression marker', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'secondary outcome', 'thrombotic']",NIAID,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,255940
"Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT For epidemiological studies, future clinical trials, and personalized patient care, there is a critical need to create a risk-stratification system for microbial keratitis. Microbial keratitis (MK), a debilitating, infectious corneal disease, is estimated to be the fourth-leading cause of blindness worldwide. MK severity depends on a complex interaction of patient, organism, and environment, resulting in a spectrum of clinical presentations and responses to treatment. Clinical presentations manifest with unique morphology features and clinical symptoms. Morphology features are visible in the cornea, and symptoms are measurable. But most patients are treated with non-specific broad-spectrum antimicrobials, an approach that increases antimicrobial resistance. This non-specific treatment approach lacks congruence with the unique MK presentations. There is a critical need for a new strategy to personalize treatments for MK and measure treatment efficacy. With quantified MK morphologic and clinical features, clinicians will have the tools to risk-stratify patients. The long-term goal is to develop rapid, objective, personalized treatment plans for patients with MK. This proposal’s objective is to quantify dynamic morphologic and clinical MK features using image and electronic health record (EHR) analyses and then build a risk-stratification scoring system associated with MK outcomes. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that morphologic and clinical features accurately risk- stratify patients for corneal and vision outcomes. Our premise is supported by preliminary data demonstrating that: (1) different organisms generate distinct morphologic and clinical features; (2) clinicians quantify morphology less precisely than image-analysis methods, (3) an expert is able to use MK features to tailor treatments; (4) the use of quantified features has improved outcomes in other diseases, such as diabetic retinopathy, by helping providers to tailor treatments; (5) EHR data can be used to quantify and classify clinical disease features accurately; and (6) EHR data can be used effectively to risk-stratify patients. Aim 1 will develop objective image analysis tools to measure features of MK with existing clinical equipment. Aim 2 will evaluate MK treatment efficacy using morphologic image analysis and clinical features from prospective surveys. Aim 3 will risk-stratify patients with MK by combining image analysis and EHR extracted data. The expected outcomes are: (1) characterized databases of MK images and linked clinical data, (2) quantified MK features across a spectrum of clinical presentations, (3) performance-tested, open-source imaging algorithms and surveys to measure MK markers dynamically, and (4) a novel risk stratification model and scoring system. The resultant work will have significant value to clinicians. Clinicians can use practical, low-cost technologies and readily-available EHR data to quantify MK features and risk-stratify patients in order to tailor treatments. NARRATIVE The clinical management of microbial keratitis is imprecise and dependent on the expertise of the treating physician. Our innovative strategies will quantify corneal features using image analysis and available clinical data from the electronic health record. Quantified image features will be linked to health outcomes to give physicians new tools to risk-stratify patients and to tailor their management to optimize outcomes.",Quantifying Microbial Keratitis to Predict Outcomes: An Imaging and Epidemiologic Approach,10113626,R01EY031033,"['Algorithms', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Blindness', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Control Groups', 'Cornea', 'Corneal Diseases', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diabetic Retinopathy', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Equipment', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Inflammatory', 'Keratitis', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'National Eye Institute', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Provider', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Self-Examination', 'Severities', 'Standardization', 'Strategic Planning', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Universities', 'Virulence', 'Vision', 'Visual Acuity', 'Work', 'antimicrobial', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'care systems', 'case control', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'epidemiology study', 'healing', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'microbial', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'performance tests', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'slit lamp imaging', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,397484
"Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management Nearly half of patients with heart disease become non-adherent to their prescribed therapies within a year of treatment initiation. This is a central and modifiable reason why cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death in the US. Despite numerous attempts to develop interventions aimed at improving adherence, these attempts have had varying and often limited success; one explanation could be that underlying barriers to adherence are not being addressed. Those interventions that have been successful often make medications easier to take but are frequently expensive to implement or deployed too late. Developing a novel provider- facing intervention that modifies medication “adherability”, defined as the properties of medications that make them difficult for patients to take, could be especially impactful and relatively inexpensive. For example, more than 30% of patients report difficulties swallowing prescribed medicines, yet little is known how this “adherability” affects long-term adherence and clinical outcomes, and few interventions focus on these issues.  To this end, Dr. Lauffenburger’s K01 proposal incorporates a novel prophylactic, patient-centric approach to provider behavior change for cardiovascular disease management. Providers often do not know what the medications they prescribe actually look like or what aspects of the medications are acceptable to or preferred by their patients. This study will uniquely incorporate patient perspectives about medication properties that lead to poor adherence in the design of a scalable provider-facing clinical decision support intervention.  The proposed aims are to: (1) develop a comprehensive framework of cardiovascular medication properties, such as appearance, side-effect profiles, or dosing, that may lead to poor adherence using patient focus groups; (2) rigorously evaluate their effects on adherence and clinical outcomes in large national data sources; (3) develop and externally validate a novel clinical prediction rule for medication adherability; and (4) develop and pilot test novel web- and electronic health record-based prescribing tools based on the prediction rule for providers. The expected overall impact of this innovative proposal is that it will fundamentally advance how to personalize medications for patients to ultimately improve adherence and health outcomes.  Dr. Lauffenburger has a unique background as a practicing pharmacist trained in epidemiology with a proven commitment to research. This proposal includes an educational plan that will address gaps in her training: expertise in behavioral sciences, prediction modeling, and implementation research. The mentorship team, led by Niteesh Choudhry, an expert in adherence and implementation, includes well-known experts in cardiovascular trials (Elliott Antman, co-mentor), biostatistics (Robert Glynn, co-mentor), and behavioral sciences (Daniel Solomon, co-mentor), and will ensure scientific success and training. By the conclusion of this program, she will be able to independently design, target, and evaluate behavioral interventions for heart diseases. The results of the proposed K01 will be invaluable pilot work for a planned R01-level application. We propose a novel strategy to address the epidemic of poor adherence to cardiovascular therapies: tailoring medications for vulnerable patients based on their “adherability”, or the properties of medication like dosing frequency, palatability, and side-effect profiles, that make them difficult to take regularly. To achieve the proposed research, we will conduct focus groups with at-risk patients, determine the effect of adherability on long-term adherence and cardiovascular outcomes, develop and validate a novel adherability clinical prediction rule, and pilot test a simple, scalable clinical decision support tool for providers. The overarching goal is to improve clinical outcomes by optimizing medications for patients at the time of prescribing, which is a central mission of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI).",Development of a novel medication adherability tool to improve cardiovascular disease management,10132378,K01HL141538,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Appearance', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Biometry', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Deglutition', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Dose', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Focus Groups', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Palate', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Property', 'Provider', 'Regimen', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Review Literature', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Shapes', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior change', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'design', 'health belief', 'implementation research', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'medication compliance', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prophylactic', 'provider behavior', 'side effect', 'success', 'successful intervention', 'support tools', 'systematic review', 'theories', 'tool', 'virtual']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,K01,2021,143581
"Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposed study is motivated by the public health importance of aortic stenosis (AS), a common form of valvular heart disease that is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Once symptomatic, survival is a dismal 50% at 1-year if left untreated. Clinical symptoms develop once cardiac compensatory mechanisms fail, indicating the need for aortic valve replacement (AVR), but because AS primarily affects the elderly, symptoms are often incorrectly attributed to comorbid conditions, advanced age, or both—resulting in delayed treatment. While most patients that eventually undergo AVR experience improvements in symptoms and survival, nearly half of patients die within the first year after AVR or fail to reap the symptom and health status improvements for which they underwent AVR. Our research suggests that irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury related to delayed treatment contribute to these poor clinical outcomes, highlighting the unmet need for objective and sensitive measures to inform clinical decisions regarding the timing of AVR. Our long-term goal is to develop and implement an omics-based precision medicine approach for identifying patients with severe AS at-risk for irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury who would benefit from earlier AVR, and our central hypothesis is that multi-omic signatures reflective of dimensions of cardiac structure and function will identify irreversible cardiac remodeling and therefore predict the clinical response to AVR. Our prior work and preliminary studies provide strong support for our hypothesis and demonstrate that our experienced multidisciplinary team is uniquely qualified to complete the proposed study. We have identified metabolomic signatures that relate strongly to measures of cardiac function and structure and predict mortality after AVR, and also proteomic signatures relating to cardiac function that differentiate severe AS and associate with mortality. Within this proposal, we adopt a longitudinal systems biology approach that leverages the latest in proteomic and metabolomic (multi-omic) sciences to: discover, test, and cross-validate multi-omic signatures of cardiac function and structure in patients with severe AS (Aim 1); characterize longitudinal multi-omic signatures and associations with changes in cardiac structure and function after AVR (Aim 2); and evaluate the accuracy with which multi-omic signatures predict response to AVR (Aim 3). Our approach will enable us to identify multi-omic signatures of irreversible cardiac remodeling and injury in patients with severe AS. These data will support the development of new precision medicine-based strategies for identifying patients who would benefit from earlier clinical intervention in an effort to reduce mortality and maximize health after AVR. PROJECT NARRATIVE Aortic stenosis ultimately leads to heart failure and death, but valve replacement is curative. For many patients, valve replacement is performed too late, after damage to the heart muscle is no longer reversible, resulting in persistent symptoms and increased risk for death. The goal of my research is to identify compounds within the blood that can serve as an early warning that the heart is struggling to overcome aortic stenosis and can therefore help physicians plan the optimal timing of valve replacement surgery.",Multi-Omic Markers of Cardiac Function and Structure within the Pressure Overloaded Heart,10127697,R01HL151838,"['Adopted', 'Affect', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Biological Process', 'Blood', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Distress', 'EFRAC', 'Early Intervention', 'Elderly', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heart', 'Heart Injuries', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction', 'Left Ventricular Remodeling', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Myocardium', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Prospective cohort', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Ventricular', 'Work', 'aortic valve replacement', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'experience', 'heart dimension/size', 'heart function', 'metabolomics', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'patient registry', 'persistent symptom', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predicting response', 'predictive signature', 'pressure', 'protein metabolite', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'valve replacement']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,665495
"(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI Abstract Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in the US has increased by 38% over the last eight years, with drugs as a major contributor to AKI in hospitalized patients. Drug-associated AKI (D-AKI) results in severe consequences with approximately 40% of patients experiencing in-hospital death or dialysis dependence and 70% having evidence of residual kidney damage following the initial D-AKI event. We have determined that many patients at high risk for AKI are identified late and often continue to receive nephrotoxic drugs until AKI becomes severe. Thus, we designed a proposal to address the need for early, appropriate management of nephrotoxins in high-risk patients by studying the effect of an advanced clinical decision support system (CDSS) for primary physicians and hospitalists aimed at reducing D-AKI in hospitalized adults. Specifically, we aim to 1) optimize the clinical performance of D-AKI risk-alerts generated by a clinical decision support system; 2) test whether an advanced clinical decision support system coupled with a pharmacist-led intervention improves short and long- term outcomes for patients with D-AKI; and 3) determine physician perception of the pharmacists’ performance, physician acceptance and cost-effectiveness of our intervention. In 2012 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) published the first comprehensive AKI clinical practice guideline. Recommendations include the use of standard criteria for defining and staging AKI and a series of stage-based management steps to be considered for all patients with AKI or at risk for developing it. However, clinicians have been slow to adopt these recommendations and some groups (most notably the US KDOQI expert panel), while endorsing the guideline overall, have called for more research testing the recommendations. Our proposal directly addresses this concern by testing whether a unique clinical decision support system identifying high risk patients coupled with an advanced pharmacist service directed to the primary physician can address D-AKI and drug dosing for other forms of AKI to improve patient care. Thus, our central goal is to examine the effect of a pharmacist-led intervention on the early detection and management of AKI, progression of and short-term recovery from AKI, and on various AKI-related outcomes. Project Narrative Patients at high risk for acute kidney injury are often identified late and often do not receive recommended diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, with drugs being the most common cause; yet are potentially preventable. Clinical decision support to physicians in the form of automated alerts and pharmacist guidance for high-risk patients with drug-associated acute kidney injury (D-AKI) could dramatically improve risk assessment, medication use, and drug dosing in even non-drug-associated acute kidney injury. In this randomized control trial application, we will test whether adult hospitalized patients with D-AKI, cared for by physicians randomized to receive clinical decision support with an advanced pharmacist-led intervention, will have a lower risk for dialysis and premature death.",(MEnD-AKI) Multicenter Implementation of an Electronic Decision Support System for Drug-associated AKI,10209005,R01DK121730,"['Accounting', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Adverse drug event', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Clinical Practice Guideline', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Cost Analysis', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Dose', 'Drug Modelings', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health system', 'Hospitalists', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacists', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Predictive Value', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Recommendation', 'Recovery', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Services', 'Site', 'Staging', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Update', 'aging population', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'control trial', 'cost', 'cost effectiveness', 'design', 'detection platform', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'equipment training', 'experience', 'group intervention', 'high risk', 'imaging agent', 'implementation cost', 'implementation intervention', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'nephrotoxicity', 'non-drug', 'post intervention', 'premature', 'renal damage', 'risk prediction model', 'standard of care']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,562198
"Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis Project Summary/Abstract: Coccidioidomycosis, caused by the highly infectious dimorphic fungi Coccidioides posadasii and C. immitis, inflicts a heavy and rapidly growing burden of disease, with 150,000 new cases annually in the United States. Clinical symptoms of coccidioidomycosis are highly variable, depending on the degree of exposure and robustness of host cell-mediated immunity – 40% of exposed individuals develop an acute primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis syndrome indistinguishable from regular community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). While most of these patients eventually resolve their infection, 41-43% are hospitalized for a median of 6 days, with disabling symptoms lasting several months. A subset of patients, especially individuals with impaired cell-mediated immunity, progress to other, more severe coccidioidal clinical syndromes, including disseminated infection, with high rates of morbidity and death. Although coccidioidomycosis causes 30% of CAP cases in highly endemic regions, the clinical presentation is challenging to differentiate from viral or bacterial CAP and available diagnostic tests have significant limitations, leading to median diagnostic delays of 23-48 days, with many patients having delays lasting several months. Meanwhile, patients seek medical care for their symptoms, with unnecessary hospitalizations, exposure to empiric broad- spectrum antibiotics, laboratory tests, imaging, and invasive procedures. A critical barrier to improving clinical outcomes in these patients is the lack of reliable diagnostic methods that identify coccidioidomycosis early in the course of infection and distinguish it from other common infections with a similar clinical presentation. Once coccidioidomycosis is diagnosed, it is also challenging to determine whether patients are responding to antifungal therapy, due to slow resolution of symptoms and abnormal imaging and laboratory findings. To address this unmet need, we propose a novel approach to the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis based on detection of fungal volatile metabolites in the breath. We will test the hypotheses that (a) patients with coccidioidomycosis have unique breath metabolites that differentiate them from patients with other infections, and (b) kinetics of these metabolites predict responses to antifungal therapy. We will: (1) identify breath volatile metabolites that distinguish patients with coccidioidomycosis from those with similar clinical syndromes, including CAP and other mycoses, and (2) examine the relationship between early changes in these breath metabolites in patients with coccidioidomycosis treated with antifungal therapy and their clinical outcome. Successful completion of these aims will lay the groundwork for a novel assay for the direct detection of Coccidioides metabolism that can be coupled to a point-of-care gas sensor system for the rapid, bedside identification of patients with coccidioidomycosis, reducing diagnostic delays, guiding appropriate initiation of treatment in patients at risk for severe or disseminated disease, averting unnecessary antibiotic use, and improving clinical outcomes in patients with this morbid, life-threatening infection. Project Narrative Coccidioidomycosis, or Valley Fever, inflicts a heavy and growing burden of disease in the Americas, with over 150,000 new cases per year in the United States alone. Because symptoms of Valley Fever are nonspecific and currently available diagnostic tests are unable to differentiate Valley Fever from other infections early in the course of infection, patients are often only diagnosed weeks to several months after they initially present with symptoms. We will identify fungal metabolites in the breath that (a) can be used to diagnose Valley Fever earlier in the course of infection than currently possible, differentiating it from other fungal infections and other common infections such as viral or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia, and (b) allow monitoring of the clinical response to antifungal therapy, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes in patients with this highly debilitating and life-threatening infection.",Breath Volatile Metabolites for the Diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis,10110180,R21AI156279,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Americas', 'Antibiotics', 'Antibody Response', 'Antifungal Therapy', 'Arizona', 'Aspergillosis', 'Biological Assay', 'Boston', 'Caring', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Coccidioides', 'Coccidioides immitis', 'Coccidioides posadasii', 'Coccidioidomycosis', 'Coupled', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Exposure to', 'Gas Chromatography', 'Gases', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Histoplasmosis', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Laboratory Finding', 'Life', 'Lung', 'Mass Fragmentography', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mycoses', 'Outcome', 'Paracoccidioidomycosis', 'Patients', 'Primary Infection', 'Procedures', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'Viral', 'Visit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'bacterial community', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'community acquired pneumonia', 'desert fever', 'disabling symptom', 'fungus', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'laboratory facility', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pathogen', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'response', 'sensor', 'supervised learning', 'tandem mass spectrometry', 'treatment response']",NIAID,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,278671
"Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma SUMMARY: In 2016, nearly 50,000 adults in the US were diagnosed with oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and nearly 10,000 died from the disease. Human papillomavirus (HPV) is now recognized as the most common cause of oropharyngeal (OP) SCC in the US. Although concomitant chemo- and radio-therapy is the most common treatment choice in patients with advanced OP-SCC, they have substantial short- and long- term morbidity and result in increased health care costs in patients who are cured of their cancers. These patients live with sometimes disabling morbidity for many years post-treatment. For these reasons, it has been suggested that therapy in lower risk patients might be de-escalated. There is also a higher risk cohort of patients in whom treatment with chemo-radiation may be insufficient, often resulting in distant metastatic failure. As such, these patients may require intensified therapies to improve outcomes. This is an agonizing choice for patients and their doctors, however. While patients do not want to be sickened by morbid treatments, they are obviously concerned about having the best chance at cure. Unfortunately, there currently are no companion diagnostic tools to identify which HPV + OPSCC patients are at (1) low risk of recurrence such that they can be treated safely to high cure rates with de-escalated therapy; (2) higher risk of failure despite aggressive high dose chemoradiation in whom treatment intensification strategies should be studied.  Recently, we developed a quantitative histomorphometric based image risk classifier (QuHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of tumor morphology (e.g. nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture) from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to predict progression in HPV+ OP-SCC patients; the current version of QuHbIC has already been validated in >400 patients and found to be superior to clinical variables in outcome prediction. In this Academic-Industry Partnership we seek to further improve predictive accuracy of QuHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as promising markers of unfavorable prognosis in HPV+ OP-SCC. We also seek to create a pre-commercial QuHbIC companion diagnostic test that is ready for clinical use in risk stratification in p16+ OP-SCC. QuHbIC will be trained on >700 retrospectively identified HPV + OP-SCC whole tissue slide images with associated long term outcome data and then validated on 440 cases from randomized, controlled, multi-institutional RTOG 0129 and 0522 clinical trials.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) computational histomorphometry from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve University, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in HPV+ OPSCC from Vanderbilt University and the Cleveland Clinic and, (3) Inspirata Inc., a cancer diagnostics company that will bring quality management systems and production software standards to establish QuHbIC as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for oropharyngeal cancers. Project Relevance: In this project we propose to optimize and validate a quantitative histomorphometric-based image classifier (QuHbIC) to better risk stratify survival among p16+ (Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related) OPSCC patients. The successful validation of QuHbIC could pave the way for its adoption as an Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of patients for whom therapies could be either ""de-escalated”, left as standard, or even potentially escalated, depending on risk status.",Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (QuHbIC) in HPV + Oropharyngeal Carcinoma,10114984,R01CA220581,"['Adoption', 'Adult', 'Aftercare', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Categories', 'Cervical', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Chromosome abnormality', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Eligibility Determination', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Epithelial', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'HPV-High Risk', 'Head Cancer', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International Union Against Cancer', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mutation', 'Neck Cancer', 'Nuclear', 'Oropharyngeal', 'Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Production', 'Progressive Disease', 'Publishing', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent disease', 'Regimen', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Specimen', 'Squamous cell carcinoma', 'Stage Grouping', 'Stains', 'Stratification', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'Universities', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'cohort', 'commercialization', 'common treatment', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'disorder risk', 'economic need', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'malignant oropharynx neoplasm', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'overtreatment', 'patient subsets', 'pharynx squamous cell carcinoma', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'risk stratification', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'treatment response', 'treatment risk', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1
"Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC) SUMMARY: In 2018, nearly 34,000 adults in the US and over 275,000 worldwide were diagnosed with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC). In the US alone >6,600 died from the disease in 2018. In addition to stage, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, depth of invasion, and close or frankly positive resection margins are used to help stratify patients into low-, intermediate-, or high risk categories. Currently, all OC-SCC patients are treated primarily by surgical resection. Post-operative treatment depends on patient risk category. Low-risk patients receive surgery alone and studies have shown the benefit of PORT (Post-operative radiation therapy) in selected patients. A retrospective analysis of 1467 patients with low-risk OC-SCC where 740 (50.4%) received PORT had improved overall survival compared to 727 patients treated with surgery alone. Identifying these patients and better stratifying their risk of progression is critical. Meanwhile, patients with loco-regionally advanced (i.e. intermediate and high risk) disease are treated with PORT as standard. Select high risk patients may be treated with concomitant chemoradiation or subsequent chemotherapy. There is thus an urgent need to develop companion diagnostic tools to better define which patients will benefit from PORT, or, if intermediate or high risk, who will benefit from systemic therapy intensification.  Recently, our group has developed a OC-SCC histomorphometric based image risk classifier (OHbIC) that uses computerized measurements of nuclear orientation, texture, shape, architecture from digital images of H&E-stained tumor sections to identify patients who are likely to recur versus those who are not. OHbIC was trained and validated on N=115 OC-SCC patients, and it had a 2 and 7-fold higher-correlation with disease specific survival compared to the 7th edition AJCC N- and T-stage (clinical variables used in patient prognosis). In this NIH R01, we seek to further improve the prognostic and predictive accuracy of OHbIC by incorporating new classes of image features relating to stromal morphology, pattern of invasion at the tumor leading edge, density and patterns of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, and tumor cell multi-nucleation, features now recognized as potential histopathological markers of prognostic relevance in OC-SCC. Additionally, we seek to 1) validate OHbIC as prognostic of survival in clinically defined low-risk patients and identify those low-risk patients who would benefit from PORT and 2) validate OHbIC as not only prognostic of survival but also predictive of benefit from chemotherapeutic intensification for patients with loco-regionally advanced disease.  This partnership will leverage long-standing collaborations in (1) digital pathomics from the Madabhushi group at Case Western Reserve, (2) surgical pathology and oncology expertise in oral cancer from Vanderbilt University, Cleveland Clinic, San Francisco VA, and Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai to establish OHbIC as a tissue non-destructive and Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) solution for OC-SCC patients. Project Relevance: In this project, we seek to improve the predictive accuracy of a computerized histomorphometric predictor (OHbIC) for risk stratification, outcome prediction and added benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (OC-SCC) from routine H&E tissue slide images. The success of this project will pave the way for its adoption as a tissue non-destructive Affordable Precision Medicine (APM) companion diagnostic tool, allowing for the identification of OC-SCC patients for whom therapies could be either left as standard, or require “escalation”, depending on the OHbIC risk score.",Oral Cavity Quantitative Histomorphometric Risk Classifier (OHbIC) in Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OC-SCC),10075748,R01CA249992,"['Adjuvant', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American Cancer Society', 'American Joint Committee on Cancer', 'Architecture', 'Biological Assay', 'Cancer Center', 'Categories', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Cooperative Group', 'Clinical stratification', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Eligibility Determination', 'European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Head and neck structure', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'India', 'Left', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Nuclear', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral cavity', 'Outcome', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Platinum', 'Play', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Therapy Oncology Group', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Regimen', 'Relapse', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'San Francisco', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Smoking', 'Staging', 'Stains', 'Standardization', 'Surgical Oncology', 'Surgical Pathology', 'System', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissue Stains', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Cell Invasion', 'Tumor stage', 'Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'collaborative trial', 'companion diagnostics', 'computerized', 'cost', 'density', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'lymphatic Invasion', 'malignant mouth neoplasm', 'men', 'mouth squamous cell carcinoma', 'neoplastic cell', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'perineural', 'power analysis', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'predictive marker', 'predictive test', 'prognostic', 'prognostic assays', 'prognostic of survival', 'prospective', 'risk stratification', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'treatment choice', 'tumor', 'tumor behavior']",NCI,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,697902
"Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities Abstract: Diversity in the rates of progression and mortality of COVID-19 disease within infected African American (AAs) subgroups are clearly not just a function of the underlying health conditions that increase the rate of mortality for COVID -19 patients, such as hypertension, obesity and diabetes, but may also be affected by host genetic factors. Here we propose a series of studies to advance the understanding of our knowledge in relative to the health inequity in COVID-19 disease. This is a multiple-collaborative study between Genomic, Imaging research labs and Statistical studies. Research teams in Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM) have established intimate relationships that position the institute to focus their research works on underserved minorities. We plan to develop and disseminate technological approaches in identifying host factors that disproportionately affect AAs COVID-19 infected patients. Given that the discovery, and establishment of translational implementation of novel solutions to health disparities in high-risk minority COVID-19 infected is our overall goals. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), encoded on the X-chromosome, has been shown to be a functional receptor for COVID-19 to enter host target cells and the concern might arise regarding whether ACE2 variants between and within subgroups would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 infected patients. Therefore, the long-term goal is to compare how genetic variants of the ACE2 receptor, chemokine (CCL2) and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes (influence the immune system’s response to viruses and bacteria), affects COVID-19 disease severity among people but no underlining disease like diabetes, heart or lung disease with those with mild or no disease manifestations. Short-term goal; we will focus on two aims; Aim: 1-Determine genetic variations in ACE2 gene on obtained DNA samples from COVID-19 infected patients and evaluate for potential correlation between ACE2 variant frequencies in relationship to COVID-19 disease progression and mortalities between and within AAs and non-Hispanic Caucasian CAs subgroup;. COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2 which uses host cell ACE2, TMPRSS2, EZRIN and other proteins for entry. Differences in ACE2 or TMPRSS2/EZRIN genes expression and SNPs may justify the disease disparity and aim 2 will address how COVID-19 spike engagement with host cell receptor is precisely regulated and how host cells respond to cytokines elicited by COVID-19 infection using lung organoids. A recent correlation study suggested that the decrease expression of ACE2 /TMPRSS2/EZRIN are predictors of decreased susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and could be attributed to COVID-19 morbidity in Africa American patients. Aim-2: Modeling COVID-19-elicited disease disparity using lung organoids. Clinical validation of ACE2 and EZRIN will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome and mortality gaps between African American and Caucasians patients. . Given the facts of a significant racial disparity in COVID-19 disease among African American (AA) and Caucasians, there is an utmost need to understand the COVID-19 infectivity host factors biology. Apart from socioeconomic factors and underlying comorbidities, AA clearly differ from Caucasians on a number of accounts, including COVID-19 mortalities genetic predisposition, which favors for high incidence and mortality rate COVID- 19 disease manifestations. Studies clearly demonstrate that ACE 2 encoded on the X-chromosome which COVID-19 virus use to entry host may be differentially expressed among individuals, therefore, we propose to determine that ACE2 and other genes, such as Ezrin plays vital role in regulating the COVID-19 virus infectivity resulting in racial disparity and the clinical validation of ACE2 and ezrin will help to develop better strategies for COVID 19 diagnosis and treatment to reduce the observed COVID-19 disease progressive outcome gaps between African American and Caucasians.",Center for Translational Research in Health Disparities,10221307,U54MD007602,"['2019-nCoV', 'ACE2', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African American', 'American', 'Bacteria', 'Biology', 'Blood specimen', 'CCL2 gene', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 diagnosis', 'COVID-19 morbidity', 'COVID-19 mortality', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Caucasians', 'Cells', 'Center for Translational Science Activities', 'Clinical', 'Correlation Studies', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Hospitals', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Immune system', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Knowledge', 'Lung', 'Lung diseases', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morehouse School of Medicine', 'Not Hispanic or Latino', 'Obesity', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Progressive Disease', 'Proteins', 'Receptor Cell', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Statistical Study', 'Subgroup', 'TMPRSS2 gene', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'X Chromosome', 'chemokine', 'comorbidity', 'cytokine', 'differential expression', 'ezrin', 'genetic variant', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'predictive modeling', 'racial disparity', 'receptor', 'response', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'underserved minority']",NIMHD,MOREHOUSE SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U54,2021,177500
"Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups ABSTRACT Although patients with Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) present with shared clinical signs and symptoms (proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and edema), there is dramatic variability in prognosis and response to therapy, frustrating patients, families and their clinicians. Even within the histopathologic categories used in the current diagnostic approach (e.g. minimal change disease, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis), there is dramatic variability in disease progression and response to therapy, highlighting the underlying biological heterogeneity within the groups. Small studies with broad, clinical patient inclusion criteria have demonstrated that a subset of patients respond well to anti-TNF therapy, but accurate pre-treatment response of those individuals is not possible based on routine clinical parameters. This project will leverage the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network (NEPTUNE) cohort study, a multi-center prospective study of 600 patients with FSGS, MCD and MN with rich clinical data, kidney biopsy tissue and gene expression profiles. This study will leverage the kidney tissue gene expression data to identify a subgroup of patients with TNF-alpha pathway activation, assess associated clinical outcomes and identify non- molecular predictors of the subgroup. The aims are:  Aim 1: To identify a subgroup of Nephrotic Syndrome patients with homogeneous activation of the  TNF-alpha transcriptional pathway.  Aim 2: To compare molecular subgroups with conventional clinical-pathologic classification in  clinical outcome prediction.  Aim 3: To identify non-invasive markers (e.g. demographics, blood and urine markers), standard  pathology features and novel pathologic biopsy descriptors associated with the TNF-alpha subgroup. To accomplish this project, the applicant will pursue formal training in systems biology, genetic epidemiology and bioinformatics. She will be mentored by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in systems biology, epidemiology and bioinformatics. The long term objective is to improve the clinical care of patients with Nephrotic Syndrome by improved understanding of the underlying biology, identifying novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for future validation in animal models and mechanistic-based interventional clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Nephrotic Syndrome, caused by several rare kidney diseases, is characterized by an abnormal amount of protein in the urine, swelling and kidney failure. Patients affected by the syndrome suffer complications of the disease as well as the toxicity of the immunosuppressive therapy used to treat it, but their individual presentations, response to treatment and prognosis can vary markedly. This project aims to use gene expression levels from kidney biopsy tissue to identify the subgroup patients most likely to respond to TNF- alpha blocking medications, an approach which, if validated, may help to inform targeted therapy selections for these patients.",Integrative Molecular Epidemiology Approach to Identify Nephrotic Syndrome Subgroups,10153763,K08DK115891,"['Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Course of Disease', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Edema', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genotype', 'Grant', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypoalbuminemia', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Kidney Glomerulus', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Membranous Glomerulonephritis', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Disease', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Nephrotic Syndrome', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Prospective cohort study', 'Proteins', 'Proteinuria', 'Publications', 'Renal glomerular disease', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Swelling', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'TNF gene', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic immunosuppression', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'biological heterogeneity', 'biological systems', 'clinical care', 'clinical epidemiology', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'demographics', 'genetic epidemiology', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'kidney biopsy', 'member', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient response', 'patient subsets', 'predict clinical outcome', 'response', 'skills', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K08,2021,169560
"Myocardial Radiomics and Mechanics in the Pathology and Prognosis of Cardiovascular Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Though knowledge advances have been made in identification and treatment of risk factors, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the U.S., and has been worldwide for the past 15 years. The mechanisms of three leading sources of CVD morbidity, ischemic coronary artery disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, appear rooted in myocardial pathophysiology of the left ventricle (LV), suggesting that deeper phenotyping of the LV may provide insight into the diseases. The detection of earliest forms of LV dysfunction has been challenging: traditional measures of LV structure and function associated with poor outcomes, such as mass and ejection fraction, reflect advanced stages of disease. However, recent advances in quantitative imaging of the LV myocardium using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images may bridge this gap. Myocardial texture analysis is a type of ‘radiomics’, the computation of myocardial pixel intensity and patterns, which has shown the ability to differentiate pathological patterns in LV hypertrophy. Additionally, analysis of myocardial mechanics including strain and torsion have shown prognostic value in evaluation of cardiomyopathies. Thus, increasing evidence indicates roles for these technological advances in imaging analysis to evaluate pathological LV remodeling in subclinical cardiovascular disease in the general population. We hypothesize that application of these novel imaging analytics, correlated with biology, subclinical disease phenotyping, and outcomes, will enable more granular insight into subclinical LV structural and functional changes predating overt CVD and its forms. The Framingham and Jackson Heart Studies, community-based cohorts of whites and African Americans with longitudinal follow up, offer the opportunity to gain insight in CVD development through integration of advanced secondary imaging analysis with detailed and broad phenotyping and genotyping, and clinical end-points. Thus, the objectives of our proposal are threefold: 1) to first identify myocardial texture analysis and mechanics patterns associated with prevalent CVD and risk factors, 2) to define the biological and genetic underpinnings of these phenotypes, and 3) to understand their inter-association between structure and function, and their joint relations with long-term prognosis. Execution of our Aims will elucidate novel patterns, determinants, and prognosis of underlying early and progressive myocardial remodeling and dysfunction in CVD in a large bi-racial cohort. Ultimately, our goal is for knowledge gained from this study to advance phenotyping of LV remodeling groups, methods of cardiovascular risk stratification, and development of therapies for patient care. NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of mortality in the U.S., but its multi-factorial mechanisms and early detection are not well established. Applying new analyses of cardiovascular magnetic resonance images and integrating these measures with broad existing data including risk factors, genetics, and blood biomarkers, we will obtain deeper understanding of structure and function of the heart in older aged white and African American adults.

"Patient-Generated Health Data to Predict Childhood Cancer Survivorship Outcomes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  There are approximately 500,000 childhood cancer survivors in the U.S. today. Childhood cancer survivors are vulnerable to late effects of therapy including chronic health conditions and premature death. Predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects, discussing how to manage these risks, and offering early preventions and interventions are critical components of survivorship care. Over 75% of childhood cancer survivors have prevalent symptoms, and constantly poor or worsening symptoms are associated with onset of medical late effects. However, regular symptom monitoring is uncommon in survivorship or primary care. The core concept of this R01 grant proposal is to enable regular monitoring of patient-generated health data (PGHD), including symptoms, physical activity, energy expenditure, sleep behavior and heart rate variability, and utilize these data in predicting survivor-specific risk of late effects to improve survivorship care and outcomes.  The proposed application will enroll 620 adult survivors of childhood cancer from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study who are ≥5 years post diagnosis and currently ≥18 years of age at enrollment to achieve the following 3 specific aims: Aim 1) use a mobile health platform to collect dynamic PGHD data over 3 months and use them to develop and validate risk prediction models for future quality-of-life (QOL); Aim 2) develop/validate risk prediction models and establish personalized risk prediction scores for other outcomes (unplanned care utilization, physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) using the same approach as Aim 1; and Aim 3) create a web-based tool to calculate and report personalized outcome-specific risks, and facilitate integration of risk scores into the survivor’s patient portal and hospital’s Electronic Health Record (EHR).  We have a series of preliminary data to support this R01 grant proposal: a) in a pilot study assessing 20 common symptoms with a mobile health platform, childhood cancer survivors completed 90% of all required evaluations over 3 months; and b) in a prediction analysis from ongoing cohort of childhood cancer survivors, the inclusion of longitudinal symptom data generated a superior model performance in predicting future QOL (prediction measure, AUC=0.85) compared to the use of only age, sex, and childhood cancer type (AUC=0.63).  Linking through a mobile health platform, we will use a smartphone to collect symptom data, a wrist-worn accelerometer to collect momentary activity/behavioral data, and a finger sensor to collect heart rate variability data. We will predict patient-reported outcomes (poor QOL, unplanned healthcare utilization) and clinically- assessed outcomes (physical performance deficits, onset of chronic health conditions) on the 12th and 24th months after collecting risk factors. We will apply state-of-the-art machine/statistical learning techniques to capture features of dynamic changes in PGHD to predict these outcomes. We will build a Central Cancer Survivorship Platform to integrate predicted risks presented with interpretable scores into a patient portal and EHR, and to inform clinicians and survivors about potential adverse-event risks for risk management/intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE  We propose to develop survivor-specific risk models to predict adverse outcomes of childhood cancer through collecting daily symptoms and other patient-generated health data (physical activity, sleep behavior, heart rate variability) using mobile health devices. We will apply machine/statistical learning methods to develop and validate risk prediction models, and use qualitative methods to receive input from clinicians and survivors for developing a user-friendly dashboard and decision support tools. Our risk prediction tool will facilitate informing individualized levels of specific adverse outcomes, and providing key information for clinicians and survivors to discuss in view of preventive interventions.",Patient-Generated Health Data to Predict Childhood Cancer Survivorship Outcomes,10178979,R01CA258193,"['18 year old', 'Accelerometer', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Applications Grants', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Biometry', 'Cancer Survivorship', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Early Intervention', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fingers', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health behavior', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Income', 'Intervention', 'Late Effects', 'Link', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physical Performance', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Process', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Management', 'Saint Jude Children&apos', 's Research Hospital', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Wrist', 'actigraphy', 'adverse event risk', 'adverse outcome', 'associated symptom', 'behavioral health', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'care outcomes', 'care providers', 'childhood cancer survivor', 'cohort', 'common symptom', 'dashboard', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'mHealth', 'outcome prediction', 'patient portal', 'patient variability', 'personalized risk prediction', 'premature', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sensor', 'sex', 'sleep behavior', 'sociodemographic factors', 'sociodemographics', 'statistical and machine learning', 'support tools', 'survivorship', 'tool', 'user-friendly', 'web-based tool']",NCI,ST.

"Association of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with Cardiac Electrical Instability: A Twin Study ABSTRACT Psychological stress is a potentially major risk factor for sudden cardiac death (SCD), but unfortunately not studied very well. This may in part be is due to the fact that many SCDs are unwitnessed, which makes the study of SCD triggers difficult. As a possible solution to this problem, we propose to study electrocardiographic (ECG) markers of cardiac electrical instability in a cohort of 1,000 Veteran male twins who are recruited from the Vietnam Era Twin Registry. Dr. Shah is an Early Stage Investigator who is poised to lead this effort that follows from his previous work on arrhythmia risk due to acute mental stress (K23 HL127251). His team includes several established investigators in the field of PTSD and heart disease (Viola Vaccarino, Douglas Bremner), stress and arrhythmia (Rachel Lampert), and signal processing/mobile health technologies (Gari Clifford, Larry Jamner). Dr. Shah, over the past several years, has worked closely with the Vietnam veteran twins and is an experienced investigator with this cohort. They have generated important preliminary data that demonstrates a potential relationship between PTSD and TWA; in addition, they have demonstrated feasibility of studying Veterans continuously for one week in their currently funded study which measures PTSD, autonomic function, and sleep. Dr. Shah is also leading telehealth efforts at the Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center, which has provided important methodologies for the current study to recruit and enroll participants from around the United States remotely. The first aim seeks to evaluate the relationship of PTSD symptoms and cardiac electrical instability using two ECG-based markers for arrhythmia: microvolt T-wave alternans (TWA) and morphological beat variability (MVB). Both are expected to be associated with higher PTSD symptoms, suggesting an acutely increased risk of sudden cardiac death. The relationship is also hypothesized to be moderated by genetic factors: when adjusting for genetic factors by evaluating monozygotic twin pairs discordant for PTSD, the relationship is attenuated. Aim 2 examines the relationship between everyday PTSD symptoms with an ecological momentary assessment and MVB/TWA. We hypothesize that acute increases in PTSD symptoms and stress also increase cardiac electrical instability, measured by higher TWA and MVB. Finally, aim 3 explores fragmented sleep and other behavioral correlates of PTSD as possible mechanisms through which PTSD may indirectly impact SCD risk through modifiable behaviors. Our hypothesis is that sleep fragmentation and other maladaptive behaviors such as low physical activity will result higher TWA/MVB on a daily basis. Overall, Dr. Shah is a poised and well-equipped to carry out this large project with novel methods and unprecedented reach in terms of impact and  Project Narrative Psychological stress is a potentially major risk factor for sudden cardiac death and can cause cardiac electrical instability. This study aims to address the reasons behind sudden cardiac death by evaluating the relationship of cardiac electrical instability with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We will also study the way in which PTSD-related genes, sleep disturbance, and physical inactivity may also play a role in its potential relationship with cardiac electrical risk.",Association of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder with Cardiac Electrical Instability: A Twin Study,10299148,R01HL155711,"['Accelerometer', 'Acute', 'Acute Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Address', 'Age', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Attenuated', 'Autonomic Dysfunction', 'Autopsy', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Mechanisms', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Electrophysiologic Techniques', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Health Technology', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heterogeneity', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'International', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Monozygotic twins', 'Morphology', 'Natural experiment', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Participant', 'Physical activity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Polysomnography', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychological Stress', 'Publications', 'Recurrence', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Marker', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Fragmentations', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Social Distance', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'Tachyarrhythmias', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Travel', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Twin Studies', 'United States', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Ventricular', 'Veterans', 'Vietnam', 'Viola', 'Woman', 'Work', 'adjudicate', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'biobehavior', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'cohort', 'cost', 'design', 'experience', 'heart rate variability', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'male', 'men', 'modifiable behavior', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'physical inactivity', 'poor sleep', 'prospective', 'psychological trauma', 'recruit', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'signal processing', 'sleep behavior', 'stress related disorder', 'sudden cardiac death', 'telehealth', 'traumatic stress', 'virtual']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,741461
"Multiparametric mapping of Covid-19 immune responses in Kidney transplant recipients Abstract As of May 2020, over five million confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally with over 400,000 associated deaths. Around 5-20% of patients develop critical illness, which predominantly manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome. When this develops, the estimated mortality is around 40%, and as high as 80% in ventilated patients. Several early reports describe the development of an excessive inflammatory response, the so-called `cytokine storm', which is strongly associated with rapid deterioration in clinical condition and mortality. Early reports of kidney transplant recipients, who are at high risk due to chronic immunosuppression and additional comorbid diseases, portray a concerning picture. In one series of 36 patients, 39% required mechanical ventilation, 21% required renal replacement therapy, and 28% died. Of the 11 patients that were intubated, 64% died. However, there is still an unmet need of understanding disease natural course, specific risk factors, identifying biomarkers, as well as potential impact of COVID-19 on graft/patient survival in vulnerable KTRs. To fill this information gap, we propose a comprehensive observational analysis of epidemiological factors and immunological assay results in COVID19-infected KTRs at 2 medical centers at the epicenter of COVID19 infection in NYC (Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan and Montefiore Hospital in the Bronx). We hypothesize that specific recipient clinical characteristics affect COVID-19 clinical course and that recipient immunosuppression in KTRs alters the ability of COVID-19 KTRs to develop protective anti-COVID-19 humoral and cell-mediated immunity that contributes to the morbidity and mortality of these individuals. We will test this hypothesis by 1) examining risk factors of COVID-19 severity in a large dataset of KTRs and individuals from the general population with COVID-19 (aim 1); 2) by characterizing the COVID-19 reactive humoral and cellular immune response in serially collected samples from COVID-19 KTRs (aim 2); and 3) by comprehensive assessment of DNA and serial serum, RNA, and PBMC from COVID-19 KTRs to identify disease mechanisms and potentially informative biomarkers for outcomes (aim 3). The proposed work is significant because of the high incidence of the disease, rate of community transmission, high mortality, and absence of clearly effective therapeutic options. Our studies will be amongst the first to define risk factors, predictors, and pathogenic mechanisms of COVID-19 in Kidney transplantation and may apply to recipients of other transplanted organs, as well as to individuals on chronic immunosuppression due to autoimmune diseases. Project Narrative: In this application we propose to study COVID-19 disease from SARS-CoV-2 virus in the unique risk population of Kidney transplant recipients. Using data and bio-samples from two hospital systems at the forefront of this pandemic and the highest COVID-19 case loads, we wil identify clinical and biomarker risk profiles for disease severity in transplant patients with COVID disease. In addition, we will use novel assays for humoral and cell-mediated immunity to study COVID immune responses in these immunosupppressed patients and compare with controls.",Multiparametric mapping of Covid-19 immune responses in Kidney transplant recipients,10241179,U01AI063594,"['2019-nCoV', '3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome', 'Affect', 'Antiviral Agents', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'COVID-19', 'COVID-19 morbidity', 'COVID-19 patient', 'COVID-19 severity', 'Case Series', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Critical Illness', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Defect', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Epidemiologic Factors', 'Flow Cytometry', 'General Population', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Graft Survival', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immune response', 'Immunity', 'Immunoglobulin A', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology procedure', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunosuppression', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Injury', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Kinetics', 'Longevity', 'Lymphopenia', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical ventilation', 'Medical center', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Production', 'Publications', 'RNA', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'SARS-CoV-2 immune response', 'SARS-CoV-2 infection', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Serology', 'Serum', 'Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome', 'Severity of illness', 'Surface', 'System', 'T memory cell', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Variant', 'Virus', 'Work', 'base', 'case control', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'coronavirus disease', 'cytokine', 'cytokine release syndrome', 'enzyme linked immunospot assay', 'exhaustion', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'high risk', 'immunosuppressed', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'mortality', 'novel', 'pandemic disease', 'response', 'severe COVID-19', 'study population', 'therapeutically effective', 'transcriptomics', 'transmission process']",NIAID,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2021,598676
"Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures PROJECT SUMMARY Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited. Therapeutic clinical trials in TBI have yielded disappointing results owing in part to the difficulty in accounting for clinically important heterogeneity within TBI. Early delivery of therapy is essential after TBI to reduce secondary brain injury, but unrestricted treatment of all brain injuries could be harmful. TBI stimulates a complex cascade of immunologic responses, both centrally and peripherally. These peripheral immune responses to TBI could serve as an early sensor of risk phenotype given the rapid, readily measurable response in the blood. An improved ability to risk-stratify patients on admission will streamline patient selection for aggressive interventions—such as invasive neuromonitoring—versus selection of those patients who can safely be observed reducing potential harms. Holly E Hinson, MD MCR is a Neurologist and Neurointensivist at Oregon Health and Science University where she cares for patients with severe acute brain injury. The objective of this application is to develop supervised learning models of actionable short- and long-term outcomes post-TBI and to interrogate if pre-specified immunoregulatory proteins add predictive power to the models over clinical features alone. Her central hypothesis is that immunoregulatory proteomic signatures improve our ability to classify a low-risk clinical phenotype after TBI. Dr. Hinson’s preliminary data suggest peripheral cytokine levels are associated with actionable clinical events acutely after TBI. The project employs a highly-sensitive, single molecule immunoarray (SIMOA) to detect immunoregulatory proteins complemented with an unbiased proteomic approach utilizing global discovery mass spectrometry. She will develop and assess a series of models incorporating proteomic signatures to classify: acute progressive intracranial hemorrhage (Aim 1A), acute neurologic deterioration (Aim 1B), and long-term outcomes measured by the 6-month Glasgow Outcome Scale (Aim 2). She will develop these models in a well-defined, clinical trial population (development set), and test their ability to correctly classify outcome in an independent, prospectively enrolled cohort at OHSU (test set). Under a multidisciplinary team of expert mentors, the project will generate new insights into low-risk phenotype recognition and outcome classification after acute TBI. The proposed patient-oriented research project will be enhanced by a structured didactic program in the principles of predictive modeling and patient phenotyping (including proteomics), which will provide Dr. Hinson with the critical skills she will need to conduct independent, innovative translational clinical research in the field of neurotrauma. PROJECT NARRATIVE Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death in the US, and treatment options are limited—we lack methods to assess a patient’s risk of deterioration at admission. An improved ability to classify patients early after injury will allow us to identify those who may benefit from aggressive interventions versus those who can safely be observed. The goal of the proposed project is to develop and assess a series of predictive models incorporating immune proteins from peripheral blood to aid in the prediction of which patients are at low-risk for complications and poor outcome after TBI.",Predictors of Low-risk Phenotypes  after Traumatic Brain Injury Incorporating Proteomic Biomarker Signatures,10155597,K23NS110828,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Acute Brain Injuries', 'Admission activity', 'Age', 'Benign', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Disease model', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Exclusion Criteria', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Health Sciences', 'Heterogeneity', 'Holly', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Injury', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Ion Transport', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Mentors', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologist', 'Oregon', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'ROC Curve', 'Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Series', 'Signaling Protein', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'TBI treatment', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Tranexamic Acid', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'analog', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'blood-based biomarker', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically actionable', 'cohort', 'cytokine', 'digital', 'effective therapy', 'high dimensionality', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'inclusion criteria', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient oriented research', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'placebo group', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'prospective', 'proteomic signature', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'sensor', 'single molecule', 'skills', 'supervised learning']",NINDS,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K23,2021,188709

"Identification of biologically relevant subtypes of hidradenitis suppurativa Project Summary Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a neglected, prevalent, chronic, stigmatizing, and debilitating disease that has recently been prioritized for study by NIAMS. Evidence suggests that some HS patients choose to self-manage symptoms remaining unconnected to healthcare, and some seek medical care for repeated outbreaks of boils but never receive a diagnosis. Such ‘hidden populations’ create challenges for designing research studies that are generalizable. Precision medicine initiatives and resources offer opportunities to rapidly increase our knowledge about biological causes of HS and to improve the care that HS patients receive. For example, the NIH has made considerable investments in the development of data repositories that link genetic data to EHR for hundreds of thousands of patients, including the NHGRI-funded eMERGE Network and the NIH-funded All of Us Research Program. Columbia University investigators are integral members of these nationwide programs, both as a recruitment site, as well as a data and research center (5U01HG008680, 1OT2OD026556). Engaging research participants who are willing to contribute longitudinal data is a major obstacle to precision medicine initiatives. The public’s use of the Internet and social media to obtain and exchange health-related information has created opportunities to rapidly and efficiently assemble large longitudinal cohorts, yet there are important differences from traditional research methods and best practice guidelines have yet to be developed. Columbia University is at the forefront of the development and application of these methods. A major challenge to implementing precision medicine arises from patients who share a diagnosis but have different biological causes of disease. HS patients have a high burden of comorbidities and we hypothesize that sets of comorbidities that tend to present together in individual patients can be used to identify biologically relevant disease subtypes. Here we will use three approaches to identify patterns of comorbidities within patients, to characterize the generalizability of the results from studies conducted in EHR, and to use genetic data to biologically validate comorbidities and resolve causality underlying disease associations. Training in biomedical informatics and Internet-based survey research will allow the applicant to use EHR data and Internet resources for assembling cohorts to conduct these studies, and complement her previous training in epidemiology, biostatistics, molecular biology and human genetics, providing fluency across several domains that are crucial for advancing precision medicine initiatives. Completion of this proposal will achieve the applicant’s long-term goal of obtaining advanced training aimed at implementing precision medicine in the treatment of skin disease. Project Narrative This project addresses the imperative needs of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) patients who suffer from pain, stigma, diminished quality of life, decreased work productivity, and increased healthcare costs that arise from managing a difficult-to-treat, debilitating disease with a high burden of comorbidities. We will conduct studies of HS comorbidities to identify biologically distinct subclasses of HS in large samples of patients using data in electronic health records and data collected from Internet surveys.

"Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases PROJECT SUMMARY Although cardiac amyloidosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are relatively rare causes of heart failure (HF), they are particularly challenging to detect and treat for several shared reasons: (1) on routine clinical imaging (i.e., echocardiography [echo]), they can be difficult to distinguish from superficially similar, more common forms of cardiac disease that cause left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy; (2) the diagnoses are often missed and thus patients can present late in the course of disease at a time when treatment is difficult; (3) objective, noninvasive metrics that reliably reflect disease progression have not been identified; and (4) the small number of known patients with these diseases can make epidemiology studies and clinical trials difficult to organize and conduct. For both cardiac amyloidosis and HCM, echo plays a critical role in both diagnosis and longitudinal monitoring given its ubiquitous clinical availability, safety, and low cost. More broadly, echo dominates the current landscape of routine cardiac imaging, with tens of millions of echos performed in the United States each year. However, the clinical challenges described above highlight several shortcomings of echo: it is limited in its ability to (1) diagnose disease at its early stages; (2) discriminate between morphologically similar diseases; and (3) quantify disease progression. This proposal seeks to address deficiencies in the current echo reading workflow, which is subjective and captures only a small fraction of the data available in each study. The overall objective of this application is to use advances in machine learning to develop and validate fully-automated echo image analytic approaches to diagnose and track rare cardiomyopathies, focusing on cardiac amyloidosis and HCM. Our proposal is centered on the hypothesis that highly scalable computer vision methods can be applied to echo studies to overcome limitations of the standard clinical echo reading workflow. Accordingly our aims are: (1) Apply an automated method for echo quantification and disease identification to detect and differentiate cardiac diseases that cause increased LV wall thickness; and (2) Characterize quantifiable echo measures of disease progression in cardiac amyloidosis and HCM and associate these with clinical outcomes. Our multidisciplinary team, which is composed of experts in cardiomyopathies, echocardiography, computer vision, and machine learning, will analyze echos and patient data from 2 large patient registries: the Multicenter Amyloid Phenotyping Study (MAPS) and the Sarcomeric Human Cardiomyopathy Registry (SHaRe) HCM Network, with validation using a repository of nearly 400,000 echos. The successful completion of our aims will result in an innovative tool for early diagnosis of myocardial diseases and tracking of disease progression. Importantly, our project will set the stage for conducting larger epidemiology studies of rare myocardial diseases by automating the identification of these patients, and thereby developing previously unattainable broad-based cohorts for these conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rare heart diseases such as amyloidosis (due to abnormal deposition of a protein into the heart muscle) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (due to a genetic mutation) are important causes of heart failure and sudden death in the general population. These heart diseases are difficult to diagnose, monitor, and treat because: (1) they appear superficially similar to more common forms of heart disease (e.g., high blood pressure) on imaging tests; (2) the optimal monitoring of disease progression over time has not been established; and (3) there is a lack of large-scale studies of patients with these diseases given their rarity. This project aims to use machine learning (artificial intelligence) of digital echocardiographic images to create a completely automated method for diagnosing and tracking these rare heart diseases with the ultimate goal of broad deployment of artificial intelligence algorithms in hospitals and clinics to help identify patients with these rare heart diseases earlier, better predict adverse outcomes, and increase the size and scope of patient registries to enhance research of these conditions.",Machine learning for the automated identification and tracking of rare myocardial diseases,10218258,R01HL140731,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithm Design', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloidosis', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinics and Hospitals', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary heart disease', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Face', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Information Retrieval', 'Inherited', 'Left', 'Left Ventricular Hypertrophy', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Sudden Death', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Two-Dimensional Echocardiography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'adverse outcome', 'automated image analysis', 'base', 'career', 'clinical care', 'clinical imaging', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'digital', 'disease diagnosis', 'epidemiology study', 'heart imaging', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'image processing', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel therapeutics', 'particle', 'patient registry', 'repository', 'response', 'statistical learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,646449
"Machine Learning to Reduce Hypertension Treatment Clinical Inertia PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) is a main risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It can be managed through use of antihypertensive medications and lifestyle modification (i.e., diet and exercise). Adults who have controlled BP have close to a 50% decreased risk of CVD-related mortality compared to those with uncontrolled BP. However, using current guidelines, over 40% of the 100 million US adults with HTN have controlled BP. Thus, uncontrolled BP remains a significant and largely unchecked public health issue in the United States. Interventions to improve BP control exist (i.e., medication adherence and diet and exercise), but they are mostly complex and resource intensive. If resources to improve HTN control are to be efficiently used, identifying patients who are likely to have persistently uncontrolled BP may provide an opportunity for targeted and tailored intervention and close monitoring. Application of a machine learning algorithm (MLA) to electronic medical record (EMR) data could identify patients likely to have uncontrolled BP. The use and amount of data in EMRs continues to expand and improve in quality. The Temple Health EMR contains extensive demographic, clinical, prescribing, and dispensing data. MLAs are ideally suited to harness this complex and abundant data. MLAs recognize patterns in data that may be difficult to detect by researchers and identify variables that are important for prediction of an outcome. They have been used to predict hospital length of stay, hospital mortality rates, and even detect diabetic retinopathy. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest MLA to predict risk of uncontrolled BP among adults with HTN. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled BP into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients. Third, Compare clinical management of hypertension with and without a prototype of an MLA-CDS tool through a case-vignette study. These aims align with my career goal of lowering CVD risk in adults. I will accomplish these aims with the help of an accomplished mentoring team focused on hypertension and antihypertensive medication adherence, machine learning, and qualitative interviewing and CDS-tool development. During the timeframe of this study I will gain experience in (1) MLA development and validation, (2) qualitative interviewing skills to develop CDS tools for clinicians, and (3) leadership skills for principal investigators. These skills will allow me to become an independent investigator focused on identifying people at high risk for chronic disease related to CVD events and developing tools to assist physicians in lowering CVD risk at the population level. The objective of the major study proposed in this K01 application is to first, develop and validate a random forest machine learning algorithm (MLA) to predict risk of uncontrolled blood pressure among adults with hypertension. Second, identify barriers and facilitators to implementing an MLA-clinical decision support (CDS) tool that predicts uncontrolled blood pressure into clinical settings by conducting key-informant interviews and focus groups with primary care clinicians and patients.

"Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  In the U.S., trauma is the leading cause of death for those 1-45 years old and hemorrhage remains the largest contributing factor to preventable death. Providers must rapidly identify those suffering from hemorrhage to optimize outcome, but internal bleeding remains difficult to diagnose even for experienced clinicians. Little is known on presentation about those suffering from occult hemorrhage and providers must quickly make treatment decisions in these time-pressured, time-sensitive clinical scenarios. This proposal seeks to develop through artificial intelligence, a type of advanced machine learning, prediction algorithms that could be deployed at the bedside of patients to assist clinicians with more timely recognition of hemorrhage. By doing so, we hypothesize that this approach (integrating diverse data sources that have not previously been combined to one another) could identify patterns in our patients that far surpass current capabilities to quickly detect and act on the critical components contributing to outcome. The ability to rapidly pinpoint these patterns and display them to the bedside clinician could allow more timely intervention and precise therapeutic approaches for hemorrhage control.  Beyond the challenges in rapidly identifying bleeding, current treatment of hemorrhage is rudimentary with a standard resuscitation approach for all patients. This reflects attempts to optimize outcome based upon the average treatment effect, rather than being adaptable for unique patient phenotypes. Hemorrhage is believed to initiate a complex chain of events involving crosstalk between the coagulation and inflammatory systems that are hypothesized to play a key role in outcome. Trauma has a known time zero of onset, making it an ideal model to study the immediate pathophysiologic changes associated with hemorrhage. This complex, individual patient biology is believed to explain why those suffering similar injury have differing outcomes. However, to date, these individual characteristics are poorly understood and not factored into initial treatment approaches. Through this proposal, I also seek to define novel digital biomarkers representing patient phenotypes that require precision resuscitation approaches to maximize outcome. Fundamental to reducing hemorrhagic deaths is the need to elucidate a deeper understanding of these mechanistic models of patient states. Strategies that help to identify novel patient phenotypes that could benefit from more tailored treatment pathways may provide important advances in decreasing preventable death.  The net result of this proposal will be a deeper insight into the mechanistic models contributing to evolving patient states following hemorrhage, and identify the key phenotypes or digital biomarkers associated with mortality, complications, and occult hemorrhage. Finding solutions to advance our resuscitation approaches following hemorrhage has potential to decrease complications, save lives, and reduce health care costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE In the US, traumatic injury is the number one cause of death for those under 45 years old and these deaths include many patients dying from the consequences of bleeding. Through leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (a scientific analysis approach similarly used in non-medical fields to help answer questions from large amounts of complex information), an integrated approach to measuring outcome will be developed utilizing biologic, clinical, and electronic medical record (EMR) data. The goal of this project is to lay the ground work for developing early warning detection systems that could identify those at risk of complications early and assist care providers in selecting the best treatment to minimize complications and death from hemorrhage.",Leveraging Artificial Intelligence Solutions to Develop Digital Biomarkers for Precision Trauma Resuscitation,10063555,R01HL149670,"['Abdomen', 'Abdominal Cavity', 'Address', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bedside Technology', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Provider', 'Resuscitation', 'Risk', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic injury', 'Triage', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'base', 'care providers', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'digital', 'diverse data', 'experience', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'novel', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'pressure', 'preventable death', 'profiles in patients', 'relating to nervous system', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'treatment effect']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R01,2021,695258
"Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system Project Summary/Abstract This SBIR Phase I project will develop a deep learning-based algorithm to analyze the sound of blood flow in mature arterio-venous (AV) fistulas used for hemodialysis access. This monitoring tool can help to identify fistulas with impending failure in patients who are in need of surgical intervention to ensure patency of the patient’s hemodialysis access. The specific aims of the study are (1) to create the world’s first deep learning-scale database of mature AV fistula sounds paired with ultrasound imaging from hemodialysis patients, and (2) develop and evaluate the performance of a deep learning classification model trained via semi-supervised learning to discriminate between patients with patent fistulas and patients with failing fistulas. By integrating this deep learning algorithm into Eko’s mobile and cloud software platform, we anticipate this algorithm will enable better monitoring for failing fistulas. During Phase I of the project we will recruit study subjects in vascular surgery and interventional radiology clinics at Columbia University Medical Center. The follow-up SBIR Phase II project will extend our algorithm to account for (1) broader forms of hemodialysis access including AV grafts, which often fail more frequently than fistulas, and premature fistulas, which are often abandoned, and (2) longitudinal collection and analysis of hemodialysis access sounds at commercial dialysis centers and in patients’ homes. SBIR Project Narrative In creating the world’s largest annotated dataset of mature AV fistula sounds and corresponding ultrasounds, Eko will gain unprecedented insights into fistula blood flow. We expect this to advance our scientific understanding of the fluid dynamics of fistulas, and help explain how and why hemodialysis access fails at such a high rate over time. A clinical decision support algorithm trained from this dataset can help healthcare systems detect fistula failures earlier, leading to more timely interventions that can avert costly complications, prolong life expectancy, and improve quality of life for hemodialysis patients as their care transitions from clinic to home care.",Dialysis access monitoring using a digital stethoscope-based deep learning system,10255460,R43DK129107,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Algorithms', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Auscultation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood flow', 'Bluetooth', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Distal', 'Early Intervention', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Eko', 'End stage renal failure', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Failure', 'Fistula', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart Sounds', 'Hemodialysis', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Lead', 'Legal patent', 'Life Expectancy', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Maintenance', 'Measurement', 'Medicare', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Nephrology', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Physical Examination', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Renal Replacement Therapy', 'Research Design', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Stethoscopes', 'Study Subject', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Ultrasonography', 'Validation', 'algorithm training', 'analog', 'base', 'clinical database', 'clinical decision support', 'clinically relevant', 'cloud based', 'cloud software', 'commercialization', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data streams', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'evaluation/testing', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'patient home care', 'premature', 'recruit', 'skills', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'supervised learning', 'systematic review', 'tool']",NIDDK,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R43,2021,299358
"Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases Project Summary Patients living with chronic lung diseases (CLDs) are frequently admitted to the hospital for potentially preventable causes. Such admissions may be discordant with patient preferences and/or represent a low-value allocation of health system resources. To anticipate such admissions, existing clinical prediction models in this field typically produce an “all-cause” risk estimate which, even if accurate, overlooks the actionable mechanisms behind  admission risk and therefore fails to identify a prescribed response. This limitation may explain the only modest – at best – reductions in hospital admissions and readmissions seen in most intervention bundles that have been tested in this population. An opportunity exists, therefore, to predict hospitalization risk while simultaneously identifying patient phenotypes (i.e. some constellation of social, demographic, clinical, and other characteristics) for which known preventive interventions exist. The proposed study seeks to overcome these limitations and capitalize on this opportunity by (1) conducting semi-structured interviews with hospitalized patients with CLDs, and their caregivers and clinicians, to directly identify modifiable risks and their associated phenotypes driving hospital  admissions; (2) using natural language processing techniques (NLP) to build classification models that will leverage nuanced narrative, social, and clinical information in the unstructured text of clinical encounter notes to identify patients with these phenotypes; and (3) building risk prediction model focused on actionable phenotypes with a wide-array of traditional regression and machine learning approaches while also incorporating large numbers of predictor variables from text data and accounting for time-varying trends. The candidate's preliminary work using basic NLP techniques to significantly improve the discrimination of clinical prediction models in an inpatient population has motivated this methodologic approach. The rising burden and costs of hospitalizations associated with CLDs, and the increasing attention from federal payers, highlights the critical nature of this work. Completion of this research will build upon the candidate's past training, which includes a Masters of Science in Health Policy Research obtained with NHLBI T32 support, and will provide the experience, education, and mentorship to allow the candidate to become a fully independent investigator. Based on the candidate's tailored training plan, he will acquire advanced skills in mixed-methods research, NLP, and trial design all through coursework, close  mentoring and supervision, and direct practice. The skills will position him ideally to submit successful R01s testing the deployment of the proposed clinical prediction models in real-world settings. The candidate's primary mentor, collaborators, and advisors will ensure adherence to the proposed timeline and goals and provide a  supportive environment for him to develop an independent research career testing the real-world deployment of clinical prediction models to reduce low-value and preference-discordant care for patients with CLDs. Project Narrative Every year many people living with chronic lung diseases are admitted to the hospital despite the fact that some of these admissions may have been prevented with early identification and intervention prior to the hospitalization. Previous attempts at preventing such hospitalizations have been limited by their ability to both accurately identify those at risk, and because most risk models do not provide a reason for the likely admission. The proposed work draws directly on the experiences of patients with chronic lung diseases who are admitted to a hospital, and then uses cutting edge statistical and computer science techniques to use information in the electronic health record to accurately predict the risk and the likely reason for future hospital admissions.",Using natural language processing and machine learning to identify potentially preventable hospital admissions among outpatients with chronic lung diseases,10134412,K23HL141639,"['Accounting', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adherence', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Attention', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Chronic lung disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Education', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health system', 'Home environment', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Inpatients', 'Interstitial Lung Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Machine Learning', 'Master of Science', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Nurses', 'Outpatients', 'Palliative Care', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Preferences', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policy Research', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Social support', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'administrative database', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical center', 'clinical encounter', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'cost', 'design', 'discrete data', 'end of life', 'experience', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'interest', 'model development', 'modifiable risk', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'preference', 'prevent', 'randomized trial', 'response', 'risk prediction model', 'skills', 'social', 'statistical learning', 'structured data', 'supportive environment', 'trend', 'trial design', 'unstructured data']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2021,173801
"Deep Learning Assessment of the Right Ventricle: Function, Etiology, and Prognosis ABSTRACT Heart failure imposes a tremendous burden of morbidity and mortality, costing the United States in excess of $31 billion annually. An increasingly recognized major determinant of outcomes in heart failure is right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. However, the nature and character of RV contribution to cardiovascular outcomes remains poorly understood, largely due to the imprecision of imaging and interpretation of RV morphology and function. Echocardiography, with its high temporal resolution and low cost of acquisition, serves as frontline cardiovascular imaging and a mainstay in approaches to assessing RV morphology and function. However, echocardiographic imaging of the RV is limited by factors that include technical variation in image acquisition and heterogeneity in image assessment as well as overall interpretation. We postulate that deep learning based phenotyping can offer the ability to not only more precisely characterize RV function but also classify RV imaging phenotypes according to etiologic disease states and, even further, refine prognostic evaluations of future cardiovascular risk. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will use video-based deep learning segmentation models to assess RV function, evaluate its cross-sectional relation with a range of expert-measured parameters, and examine its variation in the context of patient characteristics derived from large hospital-based cohorts. In Aim 2, we will use video-based deep learning models to produce imaging-based classification of RV disease and assess the ability of unsupervised approaches to classify RV dysfunction into various categories of disease etiology. In Aim 3, we will use models developed in part from training in Aims 1 and 2 to predict major cardiovascular outcomes including heart failure in addition to coronary artery disease, stroke, and cardiovascular death in both hospital- based and community-based cohorts. The overarching goal of this proposal is to improve the precision and standardization of RV phenotyping and determine the extent to which deep learning models can augment human assessment of the RV. This research will be accomplished in the setting of a comprehensive career development program designed to provide the candidate with the skills needed to become an independent physician-scientist in cardiovascular medicine and translational imaging science. An advisory committee of established scientists/mentors in the fields of cardiac imaging, deep learning, data science, and translational science will guide the candidate in his transition to scientific independence over the course of the award period. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Heart failure imposes a tremendous morbidity and mortality burden, costing the U.S. healthcare system over $31 billion per year. An under-recognized and yet important contributor to heart failure outcomes is right ventricular dysfunction, which remains understudied due to technical issues that have historically challenged conventional approaches to cardiovascular imaging. We will examine how deep learning models can precisely evaluate right ventricular function – and enable earlier, more accurate assessments of its contributions to cardiovascular risk.","Deep Learning Assessment of the Right Ventricle: Function, Etiology, and Prognosis",10185865,K99HL157421,"['Address', 'Advisory Committees', 'Architecture', 'Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia', 'Award', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Dissection', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Engineering', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health system', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Incidence', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Program Development', 'Prospective cohort', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Right Ventricular Dysfunction', 'Right Ventricular Function', 'Right ventricular structure', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Standardization', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Ventricular', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'hands on research', 'healthcare community', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'mortality', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'skills', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistics', 'study population', 'success', 'temporal measurement']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,K99,2021,154780
"Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia Project Summary/Abstract By 2060, approximately 14 million adults are expected to live with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD). Although ADRD patients represent 10% of the general geriatric population, they account for 37% of the direct healthcare expenditures. Compared to other older adults, ADRD patients are at a significantly higher risk of hospitalization and unplanned 30-day hospital readmission (hereafter “readmission”). Readmissions are costly and expose ADRD patients to expedited cognitive decline, premature institutionalization, and death. Availability of a caregiver after hospital discharge is critical for ADRD patients to ensure adherence to diet, medications, and follow-up appointments. There is a paucity of evidence examining readmission among the ADRD population. Most risk-assessment tools (e.g. LACE Index) have poor discrimination power and lack inclusion of influential medical and social features, and caregiver availability particular to ADRD patients. A potential solution is to develop a risk tool using hospitals’ electronic health records (EHRs) because they contain salient clinical and sociodemographic features as well as a wealth of information from physicians’, nurses’ and social workers’ notes (unstructured EHRs data). The specific research aims for this proposal are to (1) develop and validate a risk-assessment tool for predicting readmission among ADRD patients; (2) examine the feasibility/acceptability and clinical/economic utility of the readmission risk- assessment tool; and (3) develop a natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to extract information on caregiver availability from unstructured EHRs (exploratory). We hypothesize that the predictive power of our risk tool will be at least 20% higher than that of LACE Index (the current risk tool used in the Michigan Medicine hospitals). To accomplish this project, my mentors and I have defined a set of targeted career goals and educational training. My training aims include (1) gain familiarity with the clinical aspects of ADRD (linked with Research Aim 1); (2) acquire methodological skills in machine learning and predictive modeling (linked with Research Aim 1); (3) develop an understanding of the logistics of the ADRD patient discharge and care transition processes (linked with Research Aim 2); and (4) gain proficiency in NLP and algorithm validation (linked with Research Aim 3). By completion of this award, I will have used EHRs and data science to develop a validated risk-assessment tool for readmission for hospitalized ADRD patients. The results will enable efficient and targeted discharge planning to reduce readmission and wasteful spending. It will also provide pilot data needed to apply for an R01 examining the optimization of discharge process/location for hospitalized ADRD patients. This career development award will lay the foundation for me to become a unique health economist specialized in efficient care transitions for ADRD patients. Narrative Patients with Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia (ADRD) are at higher risk of hospitalization and 30-day readmission (readmission) compared to other older adults. Readmission is expensive and increases the risk of institutionalization and premature death among ADRD patients. The main goal of this proposal is to use Michigan Medicine’s electronic health records to develop a tool to identify high-risk ADRD patients.",Using Machine Learning to Improve Readmission Prediction in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia,10263307,K01AG068361,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'American', 'Appointment', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Assessment tool', 'Award', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Diet', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Discrimination', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Ensure', 'Familiarity', 'Foundations', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Influentials', 'Institutionalization', 'Intervention', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Location', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Medical', 'Medical History', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Michigan', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Discharge', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Reduction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Services', 'Social Workers', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'System', 'Training', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Validation', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'comorbidity', 'cost', 'electronic structure', 'follow-up', 'frailty', 'health data', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'premature', 'readmission risk', 'skills', 'social', 'sociodemographics', 'tool', 'unstructured data']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2021,130140
"Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure Candidate objective: My objective for this award is to become an independent quantitative scientist in analytical clinical research through structured training and mentored research experience. My goal is to become an academic leader and developer of advanced predictive models of health trajectories using electronic health records (EHR). Training objectives: I seek to sharpen my skill set as a clinical quantitative scientist using clinical informatics, EHR data warehouses, and advanced computational models. I will use the protected time provided by this award to gain proficiency in patient-clinician interactions, clinical informatics, natural language processing, and advanced survival analysis to accomplish my research aims. Background: Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome associated with aging and chronic illness. It decreases physiological reserves and increases vulnerability to stressors. The prevalence of frailty in patients with heart failure is 74%. The interplay of frailty and heart failure increases the risk for death, prolonged hospital stays, and functional dependence. One conceptual framework to operationalize frailty is accumulation of deficits: the frailty index (FI). The FI provides a risk score based on the assumption that the more ailments a patient has, the higher the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality. Prior FI models have not been used in routine clinical practice due to the following limitations: insufficient number and range of clinical variables, lack of personalized deficit detection, use of data not commonly found in EHRs, insufficient use of longitudinal analytical models including survival analysis techniques, and the reduction of FI to a cross-sectional health status rather than a health trajectory. Research Aim: The overarching goal of this application is to develop a frailty trajectory (FT) for heart failure patients that provides information integrating prior functional impairment, current functional status, and future risk of mortality. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel cross-sectional FI that uses the full breadth of outpatient EHR data and innovative machine learning data science methods to predict mortality. In Aim 2, we will use serial cross-sectional FIs to build FTs and identify clusters of individuals following a similar progression of frailty over time. In Aim 3, we will compare the prognostic value of cross-sectional FI versus FT. The VA national EHR offers the ideal context for this study, as it provides longitudinal data since 1999 and can link to administrative data from non- VA sources, including linked Medicare databases. Mentoring & environment: A multidisciplinary mentoring team will supervise my training and will oversee my mentored research projects, formal coursework, directed reading, and career development. The proposed activities will provide a foundation for transitioning to an independent quantitative data scientist developing clinical decision aids to guide patient care. Baylor College of Medicine and the Center for Innovations in Quality, Effectiveness, and Safety have a national reputation of mentoring and supporting junior faculty members from diverse academic backgrounds to independent careers as clinical-investigators. Physical frailty is common in adults with heart failure and increases the risk for poor health outcomes. Clinicians need tools to identify adults with physical frailty as part of routine care to support early intervention to treat frailty and reduce this risk. This application seeks to develop a novel measure of physical frailty using data collected as part of routine clinical care and recorded in the electronic health record.",Using Large Electronic Health Records and Advanced Analytics to Develop Predictive Frailty Trajectories in Patients with Heart Failure,10199037,K25HL152006,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Activities of Daily Living', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'American', 'Award', 'Big Data', 'Biological Models', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Investigator', 'Clinical Research', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Dependence', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Frail Elderly', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Status', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Older Population', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Quality of Care', 'Reading', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'Survival Analysis', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'advanced analytics', 'adverse outcome', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical care', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'college', 'data warehouse', 'deep neural network', 'experience', 'frailty', 'functional disability', 'functional status', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'member', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic value', 'random forest', 'routine care', 'screening', 'signal processing', 'skills', 'stressor', 'support tools', 'tool']",NHLBI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,K25,2021,143762
"Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Currently, there are nearly 13,000 patients waitlisted for liver transplant, yet only two-thirds will receive a transplant, and in 2018 approximately 2,500 patients died or were removed from the waitlist due to medical deterioration. This shortage of donor livers available for transplant has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are higher risk than typical donor livers but may be safely transplantable in carefully selected recipients. These include older donors (>70 years), steatotic livers, and livers procured through donation after cardiac death. Due to their riskiness, these marginal livers are often declined, yet as many as 84% of patients who died on the transplant waitlist declined one or more marginal livers prior to death. In light of this, certain waitlisted candidates might have derived a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a marginal organ rather than remaining on the waitlist (i.e. they would have survived longer after a transplant with a marginal liver than they would have survived on the waitlist). Currently, decisions about whether a particular marginal liver is suitable for a particular candidate are based on clinical gestalt or simple subgroup analysis using traditional regression models, which likely do not fully approximate the complex interactions between donor, recipient, and transplant factors. To account for this, we will utilize machine learning (which can incorporate complex, higher-order interactions) to predict whether a specific candidate would derive a survival benefit from undergoing transplantation with a specific marginal liver, and interview transplant candidates and surgeons to understand how best to translate these predictions into an immediately clinically-useful decision aid. To accomplish this, we will leverage Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) national data (n=293,140) and use a machine technique (random forests) to address the following aims: (1) To predict waitlist survival for waitlisted liver transplant candidates; (2) To predict post-transplant survival for liver transplant recipients of a marginal liver; and (3) To create a decision aid that compares predicted waitlist survival and predicted post-transplant survival for a specific transplant candidates with marginal liver. These aims are highly feasible given our group’s expertise in liver transplantation, analysis of national registry data, and machine learning techniques. We hypothesize that utilizing SRTR and machine learning, we can accurately predict post-transplant survival for a particular candidate with a particular marginal liver, as well as waitlist survival for that same candidate without a liver. We also hypothesize that our decision aid could be utilized in real-time to inform clinical decision-making. If the proposed aims are achieved, our decision aid could be utilized to improve clinical practice by bringing high-quality risk prediction directly to patients and transplant professionals to directly inform the real-time clinical decision of whether a candidate should undergo transplant with a marginal liver. PROJECT NARRATIVE There are far fewer donor livers available for transplant than patients who need them, which has led to the use of marginal livers – livers that are riskier than typical donor livers but yet might still provide a benefit to carefully selected patients. However, the decision to use a particular marginal liver for a particular patient is based largely on clinical gestalt or traditional clinical studies, which likely do not account for the complex relationships between donor, recipient, and transplant characteristics. To optimally inform the decision to undergo transplantation with a marginal liver or not, we propose to utilize machine learning to generate personalized risk predictions of post-transplant survival with that specific marginal liver and waitlist survival without that liver, and then develop a decision aid to be used by patients and surgeons to compare predicted survival between both options.",Development of a Machine Learning Model for Liver Transplantation,10208791,F32DK124962,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Decision Aid', 'Decision Making', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Enrollment', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Instruction', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Public Health Schools', 'Qualitative Research', 'Recording of previous events', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Statistical Computing', 'Subgroup', 'Surgeon', 'Survey Methodology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplant Surgeon', 'Transplantation', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data registry', 'high risk', 'improved', 'interest', 'liver transplantation', 'personalized decision', 'personalized predictions', 'personalized risk prediction', 'post-transplant', 'programs', 'public health research', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'risk prediction', 'survival prediction', 'theories', 'transplant registry', 'web site']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2021,84562
"Cardiac MR-Based Risk Stratification for Heart Failure and Atrial Fibrillation in HCM Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart disease, affecting as many as 1:200 individuals in the general population. HCM, initially described in the context of sudden cardiac death (SCD), is commonly associated with heart failure (HF) and atrial fibrillation (AF). Rigorous research over the past two decades has enabled us to identify HCM patients at the greatest risk of SCD who could benefit from a prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). With advances in SCD prevention, HCM management has now shifted its focus to HF and AF. Nearly 50% of HCM patients have mild to severe HF symptoms. HF is now considered the most common cause of HCM-related mortality. AF is the most common sustained arrhythmia, occurring in nearly 25% of HCM patients, and responsible for a decreased quality of life and increased stroke risk. Currently, we are not able to predict which HCM patients are more likely to progress toward end-stage HF or develop AF. Cardiovascular imaging using echocardiography and cardiac MR has played a central role in our evolving understanding of HCM. Echocardiography provides a robust assessment of left ventricular (LV) outflow obstruction and diastolic dysfunction. With its high spatial resolution and remarkable tissue characterization capabilities, cardiac MR has emerged as an imaging modality well suited to characterize the HCM phenotype. The goal of this proposal is to develop novel risk stratification paradigms by leveraging recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to improve HCM patient management. We will investigate a deep learning (DL) risk model for prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes that incorporates (a) standard clinical and imaging parameters and (b) novel cardiac MR signatures extracted using (i) radiomic analysis (i.e. a computational method to automatically extract and select clinically significant imaging markers) or (ii) deep imaging signatures, extracted using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The performance of these models will be rigorously evaluated using 3 HCM cohorts collected at Tufts Medical Center, BIDMC, and University of Toronto.

"A Quantitative Risk Model for Predicting Outcome and Identifying Structural Biomarkers of Treatment Targets in Oral Cancer on a Large Multi-Center Patient Cohort Post-resection prognostication for oral cavity cancers (OCC) is qualitative and potentially ambiguous. A significant subset (25-37%) of Stage I/II patients still develop local recurrence after treatment with surgery alone. The long-term goal of this proposal will be to create a Quantitative Risk Model (QRM) using machine learning and artificial intelligence to predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II patients using image-based biomarkers of aggression. The objective is to develop and validate state-of-the-art systems for biomarker imaging, quantification, and modeling to accurately predict risk of recurrence in cancer patients based on image analytics. The central hypothesis is that a quantitative, artificial intelligence approach to pathology will result in significantly greater prognostic value compared with manual microscope-based analysis. The rationale for this work is that tumor aggression can be predicted from patterns present in pathology images, given the existence of histological risk models that have been clinically validated in the past; however, these risk models are not in widespread use because they are less accurate, robust, and transportable to the larger community of pathologists. This proposal will test the central hypothesis through three specific aims: (1) Develop an analysis pipeline that can accurately predict recurrence risk for Stage I/II OCC patients and identify treatment targets (e.g. adaptive local immune response and angiogenesis); (2) Demonstrate robust performance across a multi-site data cohort collected from seven national and international centers; and (3) Distil the results of QRM analysis to synoptic pathology reporting, demonstrating the ability of QRM to interface with standard clinical reporting tools. The innovation for addressing these aims comes from a unique application of active learning for training artificial intelligence to recognize tissue structures, new features for quantifying tissue architecture based on the interface between tumor and host, and a novel approach for large cross-site validation. Moreover, this proposal develops a unique mapping between computational pathology and commonly-used synoptic reporting variables, enabling rapid uptake of this work into existing clinical workflows. This research is significant because it provides personalized outcome predictions for a niche group of undertreated patients with limited options and can serve as the foundation for designing future clinical trials through identification of treatment targets. Multi-site training and evaluation, combined with AI-to-report mapping, will be broadly applicable to a large group of computational approaches, bridging the gap between engineering research labs and clinical application. The expected outcome of this work is a trained model for predicting Stage I/II OCC recurrence, identification of treatment targets, and mapping to synoptic reports, as well as a broadly-applicable workflow for the broader computational pathology community. This project will have a large positive impact on patients and surgical pathologists by enabling rapid, accurate prognosis and directed treatment plans in an easy-to-use pipeline that integrates seamlessly into existing clinical workflows. We aim to develop a quantitative risk model for oral cavity cancer patients, 25-37% of whom will experience debilitating post-treatment recurrence. Using state-of-the-art machine learning and artificial intelligence methods, we will develop and validate our risk model on a large multi-site cohort of patients, and develop an AI-assisted synoptic report-filling tool for integrating into clinical practice.

"Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) represent a looming public health crisis, affecting roughly 5 million people and 11% of older adults in the United States. Studies on patient transitions across healthcare settings suggests that older adults with chronic conditions are vulnerable to inadequate transfer of information, putting them at risk for diminished quality of care, medication errors and potentially preventable complications. Patients at varied stages along the ADRD trajectory – especially those with multiple chronic conditions – may experience unique risks due to the loss of information across care settings. In a recent study, we developed a longitudinal dataset on a diverse cohort of 56,652 patients – mostly aged 65+ with multiple comorbidities – receiving home health care (HHC) services from a large non-profit home care provider. For patients admitted to HHC in 2010-2012, we identified subgroups of patients with ADRD diagnoses made prior to and after HHC admission. Outside the scope of this prior study remains a vast and largely unexplored data source – nurses’ free-text clinical notes captured in the electronic health record. With roughly 1 million entries of nurses’ free- text notes associated with the study population, there is a wealth of potential information from which to gain new insights and a need for innovative methods to analyze this unstructured data source. In this study, we propose to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, a method for systematically analyzing free-text content that draws upon machine learning. Using the dataset developed in the prior study, this study aims to: 1. Expand and improve an existing NLP system to automatically identify the following information in the  nursing free-text notes: (i) knowledge of the patient having a previously established ADRD diagnosis; (ii)  observations of cognitive symptoms and related patient/caregiver needs; and (iii) mentions of interventions  to address these needs. 2. For patients who do not have an ADRD diagnosis prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-  text documentation of cognitive symptoms identified in the NLP predict subsequent ADRD diagnoses  during the 4-year follow-up period. 3. Among patients diagnosed with ADRD prior to HHC admission, determine whether nurses’ free-text  documentation patterns (e.g. knowledge of the patient’s ADRD diagnostic status, observations of cognitive  symptoms, and interventions) predict: (i) service use; and (ii) adverse health outcomes for which ADRD  patients are at heightened risk (e.g. hospitalizations due to urinary tract infection, dehydration, falls). This study will allow us to examine HHC nurses’ practices, which are often difficult to observe systematically, and identify strategies to address the complex needs of their patients with ADRD and un-diagnosed patients who may be on a path toward ADRD diagnosis. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a home- based intervention that aims to improve quality of life for patients and caregivers along the ADRD trajectory. PROJECT NARRATIVE Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) affect about 5 million people in the U.S. Home health care nurses provide care for many people with ADRD and document what they observe about their patients’ needs in the form of free-text notes. This study will use a method known as ‘natural language processing’ to gain new knowledge from nurses’ notes and identify ways to better support people with ADRD and their caregivers.","Nurses' documentation of patient diagnoses, symptoms and interventions for home care patients with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias: A natural language processing study",10219952,R21AG065753,"['Address', 'Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease related dementia', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Assessment tool', 'Awareness', 'Care given by nurses', 'Caregivers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Nursing', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Dehydration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Documentation', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family Caregiver', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Home Care Services', 'Home Health Care Agencies', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Care Team', 'Medicare claim', 'Medication Errors', 'Methods', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'New York', 'Nurses', 'Nursing Homes', 'Nursing Services', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Provider', 'Public Health', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Management', 'Services', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Urinary tract infection', 'Visiting Nurse', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'care coordination', 'care providers', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'health care service', 'health care settings', 'hospice environment', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multiple chronic conditions', 'patient home care', 'patient subsets', 'racial and ethnic', 'study population', 'unstructured data']",NIA,VISITING NURSE SERVICE OF NEW YORK,R21,2021,213501
"Robot-Assisted 3D ICE Catheter for Cardiac Ablation ABSTRACT  Although the cardiac ablation procedure for atrial fibrillation has a wide adoption rate, it also has a high recurrence of arrhythmia primarily due to the creation of suboptimal lesions. The procedure is also associated with complications including cardiac perforation, tamponade, atrio-esophageal fistulas and thrombus. Repeated and prolonged X-ray exposure for the clinician can also lead to enhanced risk of cancer. A fluoroless approach using intracardiac echocardiography (ICE) is becoming a more widely adopted imaging option due to the absence of ionizing radiation and the possibility of real-time monitoring of the created lesions. However, the ICE- guided approach suffers from significant shortcomings, which include poor dexterity of the ICE catheter, difficulty in simultaneously manipulating the ICE and ablation catheters, unintuitive image orientation and noisy image quality. There is therefore an unmet need to overcome these shortcomings of the ICE-guided approach to enable better lesion creation and reduced complications associated with the cardiac ablation procedure. The long-term goal of this research is to develop robotic technologies, control and machine learning algorithms to enable ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. The objective is to develop a novel robotic manipulator, a steerable ICE catheter, and machine learning and control algorithms to manipulate the ICE catheter and monitor the created lesions in real-time. The rationale that underlies the proposed research is that the robot-assisted steerable ICE catheter with the catheter tracking algorithms will enable simultaneous manipulation of the ICE and ablation catheters. Further, the machine learning algorithms to monitor therapy will reduce the risk of complications, while ensuring the creation of necrotic lesions, thereby reducing the recurrence of AF. In this proposal, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) Design, develop, and model a steerable 3D ICE catheter with enhanced dexterity. 2) Design and develop a robotic manipulator and associated control algorithms to allow for precise manipulation of the ICE catheter. 3) Develop machine-learning and vision-based algorithms integrated with a navigation system for tracking the ablation catheter, and monitoring therapy. 4) Validate the robotic ICE system in heart phantom and porcine models. The proposed research is significant since it will allow for better therapeutic outcomes by reducing recurrence rates and complications associated with cardiac ablation, and avoiding exposure of the patient and clinical care team to X-ray radiation. The proposed research is innovative in that it builds on state-of-the-art robotics technology, machine learning and vision algorithms to enable fluoroless ICE- guided cardiac ablation procedures. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The proposed study addresses an important and under-investigated area of treating atrial fibrillation using a completely fluoroless approach with ICE imaging.

"Personalizing AAV Management by Leveraging Big Data: Targeting Complication Clusters PROJECT SUMMARY ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a small vessel vasculitis associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to reduced quality of life and excess mortality compared to the general population. In the context of improving rates of flare and mortality with contemporary treatments, increasing attention is shifting to complications (e.g., renal failure, infection, cardiovascular disease) as clinically-relevant and patient-oriented outcomes. However, our understanding of how best to address and prevent complications is limited because they are typically studied in isolation from a “single disease framework.” We do not understand how complications tend to co-occur in individuals in complication clusters. Moreover, with several available treatment options for AAV, comparative effectiveness studies using real-world experience data and relevant outcomes like complication clusters are needed to guide treatment decisions in a manner that personalizes care, improves quality of life, and reduces mortality. However, we do not have the methods to accurately and efficiently assemble an AAV cohort using state-of-the-art algorithms that leverage heterogeneous claims and electronic health record (EHR) data. The aims of this proposal are to (1) apply advanced clinical informatics methods (i.e., machine learning and natural language processing) to identify AAV cases in big data to assemble a large cohort and (2) determine complication clusters in an AAV cohort by applying latent transition analysis. To achieve these aims, we will leverage methodologic expertise developed through collaborations established during the PI’s K23 and use a novel data source that includes EHR data linked to Medicare and Medicaid claims. The PI’s team has previously demonstrated that unstructured (i.e., free-text) EHR data can be used to study topics mentioned in clinical notes of AAV patients and that keywords in these notes can help identify AAV patients but neither machine learning nor sophisticated natural language processing have been previously used to identify AAV cases. In addition, our prior work has examined AAV complications in isolation (e.g., renal disease, cardiovascular disease) but here we seek to identify phenotypes of complications (complication clusters) that tend to co-occur in patients, how patients transition between clusters over time, and what factors predict a person’s membership in a complication cluster. The major goal of this proposal is to build further preliminary data in preparation for an R01 application over the next 24 months. The planned R01 will focus on comparative effectiveness studies in AAV using cohorts assembled in big data and clinically-relevant, patient-oriented outcomes, like complication clusters. The results of these studies can then be used as inputs in simulation models built during my K23 to guide optimal patient-oriented treatment decisions. Ultimately, the goal of this research program is to improve quality of life and reduce complications and mortality by using data to inform personalized approaches to AAV treatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite treatment advances, ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV) remains associated with disease- and treatment-related complications that contribute to a reduced quality of life and an increased risk of death compared to the general population. To further improve these outcomes, we need to understand which medications work best to treat AAV and this requires a large group of patients to study and a better understanding of complications in AAV. This R03 proposal focuses on applying advanced clinical informatics to assemble a large AAV cohort and characterizing how complications co-occur (i.e., complication clusters) in AAV.",Personalizing AAV Management by Leveraging Big Data: Targeting Complication Clusters,10198103,R03AR078938,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies', 'Attention', 'Big Data', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Clusterings', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Excess Mortality', 'Flare', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Informatics', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Link', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Medicare claim', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Factor', 'Preparation', 'Provider', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Remission Induction', 'Research', 'Respiratory Tract Infections', 'Rheumatism', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Text', 'Time', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Treatment-related toxicity', 'Vasculitis', 'Work', 'base', 'case finding', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparative effectiveness study', 'comparative efficacy', 'data resource', 'experience', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'models and simulation', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'patient population', 'person centered', 'personalized approach', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'respiratory', 'structured data', 'treatment comparison', 'treatment strategy', 'unstructured data']",NIAMS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,105843
"Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, affecting 2 million Americans in whom it may cause skipped heart beats, dizziness or stroke. Unfortunately, therapy for AF has limited success, likely because AF represents heterogenous and poorly characterized disease entities between individuals. A central challenge is that it is not clear why a specific therapy works in a given AF patient. This uncertainty makes it challenging to develop a patient-specific approach to tailor therapy for personalized medicine.  The premise of this project is that mechanistic data is increasingly available in AF patients at scales spanning tissue, whole heart and patient levels, yet rarely integrated. We set out to use machine learning (ML), a powerful approach proven to classify complex datasets, to integrate data to address 3 clinical unmet needs. First, electrograms are rarely used to guide therapy in AF, unlike organized rhythms, because they are difficult to interpret. Second, it is difficult to understand how arrhythmia is affected by any specific ablation strategy in AF, unlike organized rhythms. This makes it difficult to improve therapy. Third, it is difficult to identify whether an individual patient will or will not have success from AF ablation. We applied machine learning and novel objective analyses to these questions to develop strategies for personalized AF therapy.  We have 3 specific aims: (1) To identify components of AF electrograms using ML trained to monophasic action potentials (MAP); (2) To identify electrical and structural features of the acute response of AF to ablation near and remote from PVs; (3) To identify patients in whom ablation is unsuccessful or successful long-term, who are poorly separated at present. Each Aim will compare ML to traditional biostatistics, and use objective explainability analysis of ML to provide mechanistic insights.  This study has potential to deliver immediate clinical and translational impact. We will apply specific ML approaches, biostatistics, and computer modeling to our rich multiscale registry. We will develop practical and shareable tools, which we will prospectively test clinically, to deliver meaningful outcomes at tissue, whole heart and patient scales. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, signal processing and biological physics. This project is likely to reveal novel multiscale AF phenotypes to enable personalized therapy. Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem that affects 2-5 million Americans, causing stroke, rapid heart beats, heart failure and even death. In this project, the applicant will apply numerical analysis and machine learning to detailed data acquired from patients undergoing therapy, to better define individual biological types of AF, which may provide a foundation for personalized patient-tailored diagnosis and therapy.",Machine Learning in Atrial Fibrillation,10130617,R01HL149134,"['Ablation', 'Action Potentials', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dizziness', 'Drug Controls', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Genetic', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Registries', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'computer science', 'convolutional neural network', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'heart rhythm', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized strategies', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'response', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'voice recognition', 'voltage']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,771584
"Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse PROJECT SUMMARY Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is a common valvulopathy affecting over 170 million worldwide. Every year, 0.4- 1.9% of individuals with MVP will develop sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) or sudden cardiac death (SCD), and 7% of SCDs in the young are caused by MVP. However, predictors of this devastating outcome are not readily available, and indications for a primary prevention implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in MVP are lacking. Severe mitral regurgitation explains only 50% of SCA cases in MVP. SCD/SCA risk has also been linked to a bileaflet phenotype with mild MR, mitral annular disjunction (MAD), and left ventricular focal fibrosis on cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) images. Such imaging parameters (including LGE) have not been evaluated prospectively. Moreover, they are not consistently found in SCA survivors, and diffuse fibrosis has been proposed as an alternative arrhythmic substrate by our group and others based on CMR/T1 mapping, strain echocardiography, and post-mortem data. Overall, it is challenging to pinpoint a unique imaging phenotype, and uncertainty exists about which MVP patients should undergo CMR. Regardless of arrhythmic phenotype, complex ventricular ectopy (ComVE - defined as frequent polymorphic PVCs, bigeminy or non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) is detected in 80-100% of MVP cases prior to SCA or SCD. ComVE, commonly associated with left ventricular fibrosis on CMR, is linked to higher all-cause mortality and SCA rates (20% versus 12% if no ComVE, p < 0.05) based on preliminary cross-sectional data. Our central hypothesis is that MVP patients with ComVE, because of the higher prevalence of either LGE or abnormal T1 mapping, represent ideal CMR candidates regardless of leaflet involvement or MAD, and can be rapidly identified by an automated “surveillance” tool within a large echocardiographic database. Moreover, we hypothesize that fibrosis is the strongest predictor of SCD/SCA in an unprecedented, multi-center effort to longitudinally assess clinical and CMR parameters of arrhythmic risk in MVP. Specifically, we aim to 1) Assess the role of CMR as a screening tool for fibrosis in MVP with ComVE incorporating T1 mapping in addition to LGE in an unselected MVP sample; 2) Develop an echo-based machine-learning algorithm to detect MVP with ComVE, test its association with myocardial fibrosis on CMR and longitudinal SCD/SCA risk; and 3) Build a novel prospective SCD/SCA risk prediction model in MVP. Better selection of CMR candidates and development of a SCD/SCA risk prediction tool inclusive of fibrosis by CMR are expected to dramatically improve risk stratification in MVP and establish future criteria for primary prevention ICD trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE Every year, 0.4-1.9% of individuals with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) will develop sudden cardiac death or arrest. In this application we propose to better identify those at risk by using cardiac magnetic resonance and echocardiography-based artificial intelligence, with the long-term goal of selecting those that may benefit most from a defibrillator. .",Prospective sudden cardiac death risk stratification using CMR and echocardiography machine learning in mitral valve prolapse,10171903,R01HL153447,"['Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autopsy', 'California', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Defibrillators', 'Development', 'Diffuse', 'Echocardiography', 'Fibrosis', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Heart Arrest', 'High Prevalence', 'Holter Electrocardiography', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Implantable Defibrillators', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mission', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Mitral Valve Prolapse', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Prevention', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'San Francisco', 'Screening procedure', 'Survivors', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'coronary fibrosis', 'cost', 'extracellular', 'hemodynamics', 'high risk', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'prognostic significance', 'prospective', 'recurrent neural network', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'risk stratification', 'secondary analysis', 'stem', 'sudden cardiac death', 'tool']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,779765
"Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Multiple myeloma (MM) is a lethal neoplasm and a common hematologic malignancy. MM is uniformly preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Unlike MM, patients with MGUS are asymptomatic. The current management for MGUS is watchful waiting for disease progression. A marked racial disparity in this disease area is long-established with a 2 to 3-fold increased risk in African Americans (AAs) compared to Caucasians. Moreover, obesity is a risk factor for MM independent of race. Obesity is prevalent in U.S. adults, and particularly more prevalent among AAs than Caucasians. As a result, without any intervention, racial disparities in this disease will continue to worsen. Metformin, a widely-used, safe, well- tolerated, and inexpensive medication, induces weight loss and has been found to be more effective in glycemic control in AAs compared to Caucasians. It has also been used in prospective trials for non-diabetes indications and solid tumor malignancies. We therefore hypothesize that metformin use in MGUS patients will prevent MM and reduce MM disparities. This project plans to focus on the precursor condition of MM – MGUS. The findings from the proposed project will inform biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials. The long-term goal is to identify intervention strategies to prevent the progression of MGUS to MM, reduce the overall burden of MM, and reduce MM disparities. We plan to identify whether high body mass index (BMI) and/or significant change in BMI over the life course are risk factors for MGUS by race (Aim 1), utilizing linked databases with nearly lifelong follow-up of BMI and other health measures ,as well as utilizing artificial intelligence, i.e., machine learning approaches, to perform big data analyses. We will then assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory after MGUS diagnosis in metformin versus non-metformin users in a subgroup of MGUS patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus (Aim 2.1) and the association of metformin use with the progression of MGUS to MM (Aim 2.2). Last, we will assess racial differences in the M-protein trajectory in the subgroup of MGUS patients without diabetes mellitus (Aim 3). This project is significant in its capability to 1) identify perhaps the only modifiable risk factor (high BMI) to inform interventions to prevent MM; 2) identify a dynamic marker for disease progression by race (M-protein concentration), where these biomarkers can be a surrogate for MM diagnosis in future prevention trials; and 3) reduce MM health disparities by a) identifying race-specific biomarkers for MGUS and MGUS progression, available through clinical encounters (as opposed to expensive genetic testing); and b) exploring metformin use as a chemopreventive measure. It is innovative in its 1) focus on MM prevention rather than treatment and 2) utilization of artificial intelligence to analyze big data. Successful completion of this study will provide evidence for a paradigm shift in current clinical practice of MGUS management and help prevent MM, an incurable and costly disease. More importantly, it will provide evidence to guide interventions to reduce MM disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in multiple myeloma (MM), a common and incurable malignancy whose management is extremely costly, are long-established. Although MM is preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) by many years, no established prevention strategies exist and current clinical practice does not treat patients with MGUS; thus, racial disparities for this disease are expected to persist or even worsen due to the disproportionate burden of obesity – a known risk factor for MM – in the African American population. This project plans to study racial differences in risk factors/biomarkers for MGUS and the progression of MGUS to MM to inform future biological mechanism studies and MGUS/MM prevention trials with the goal of reducing MM health disparities.",Addressing racial disparities in monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance and progression to multiple myeloma from a prevention perspective,10271266,R01CA253475,"['Address', 'Adult', 'African American', 'Age', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Body Weight decreased', 'Body mass index', 'Caucasians', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Clinical', 'Cost of Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Department of Defense', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease Progression', 'Economic Burden', 'Event', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International Agency for Research on Cancer', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Medicare/Medicaid', 'Metformin', 'Monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance', 'Multiple Myeloma', 'Neoplasms', 'Obesity', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Prevention trial', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Race', 'Rare Diseases', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Subgroup', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'carcinogenicity', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'diabetic', 'follow-up', 'genetic testing', 'glycemic control', 'health disparity', 'health economics', 'high body mass index', 'innovation', 'modifiable risk', 'multiple myeloma M Protein', 'obese person', 'preclinical study', 'premalignant', 'prevent', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'racial difference', 'racial disparity', 'specific biomarkers', 'working group']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,360281
"Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope Abstract This SBIR Phase II project will develop a deep learning-based clinical decision support algorithm for detecting and diagnosing valvular heart disease based on heart sounds recorded using the Eko Core and Eko Duo Digital Stethoscopes. This screening tool will help to decrease the number of patients with valvular heart disease that remain undertreated simply because their condition is not diagnosed. Auscultation is commonly the method by which valvular heart disease is first detected, but cases often fail to be referred to echocardiography for diagnosis because clinicians fail to detect heart murmurs, particularly in noisy or rushed environments. To address this challenge, Eko had developed the Core, a digital stethoscope attachment that can be added in-line to a clinician’s existing stethoscope that amplifies heart sounds and Duo, a digital stethoscope in a handheld form factor with built-in single lead electrocardiogram. Both devices are designed to stream digitized phonocardiograms to a smartphone, tablet or personal computer. There, the signal can be analyzed with the decision support algorithm we will develop as part of this project. The specific aims of this study are: (1) to collect a database with condition- specific recording labels to enable deep learning for heart sounds though clinical data collection at six clinical sites, and (2) to develop and evaluate a collection of deep convolutional neural network-based algorithms trained on the database. These algorithms will (2a) distinguish between systolic, diastolic and continuous murmurs, (2b) classify aortic stenosis (AS), mitral regurgitation (MR), tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and innocent murmurs (2c) assess the severity of AS, MR and TR. By integrating these deep learning algorithms into Eko's mobile and cloud software platform, currently used by clinicians at over 1000 institutions worldwide, we anticipate this algorithm will enable more accurate screening for valvular heart disease in adult patients, leading to earlier diagnosis and better patient outcomes. Public Health Relevance Valvular heart disease is becoming an increasingly prevalent manifestation of poor cardiovascular health in both the developed and developing world. A highly-accurate clinical decision support algorithm that is able to detect and classify valvular heart disease will impact public health by reducing unnecessary referrals for echocardiography and promoting early and accurate diagnosis in underserved areas with limited access to specialty care.",Deep Learning for Automated Aortic Stenosis and Valvular Heart Disease Detection Using a Digital Stethoscope,10215611,R44HL144297,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Aortic Valve Stenosis', 'Auscultation', 'Cardiac', 'Caring', 'Cellular Phone', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Device Designs', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Echocardiography', 'Eko', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health Personnel', 'Heart Sounds', 'Heart Valve Diseases', 'Heart murmur', 'Institution', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Medical Device', 'Methods', 'Mitral Valve Insufficiency', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Outcome Study', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Personal Computers', 'Phase', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Resources', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Specificity', 'Stethoscopes', 'Stream', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Tablet Computer', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Tricuspid Valve Insufficiency', 'accurate diagnosis', 'algorithm training', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cardiovascular health', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical development', 'clinical research site', 'clinically significant', 'cloud software', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'diagnosis standard', 'digital', 'experience', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'medical specialties', 'point of care', 'public health relevance', 'screening', 'sound', 'underserved area']",NHLBI,"EKO DEVICES, INC.",R44,2021,920184
"Studying exceptional treatment non-responders and genetics to predict treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A major challenge in caring for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is determining the optimal therapy. Several effective biologic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) are available for RA, reflecting both advances in therapy, and the heterogeneity of RA; subsets of patients respond while others do not. Prior studies focused on patients with a good response to tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi), the most common bDMARD, with limited success in finding predictors that can be used in clinical care. This proposal seeks to address that gap in knowledge by taking a different direction. The objective of this study is to focus on exceptional bDMARD non-responders, defining and characterizing patients who have been on ≥3 classes of bDMARDs for RA. We will test whether data available in clinical electronic health record data (EHR) or genomic data can identify exceptional non-responders from TNFi responders. In Aim 1, we leverage data from an EHR cohort of ~16K RA patients to determine clinical factors associated with exceptional non-response using traditional epidemiologic approaches. As well, we will apply approaches using machine learning and topic modeling that will enable us to evaluate the predictiveness of a broader range of features. Examples of features include billing codes, prescriptions, and medical concepts extracted from text notes using natural language processing. In Aim 2, we will test whether RA genetic risk factors available in a subset of patients in Aim 1, and those of other inflammatory arthritides, e.g. axial spondyloarthropathy, can predict exceptional non- response to bDMARD therapy. As part of aim 2, we will also incorporate any predictive clinical factors identified in Aim 1 through the traditional or topic modeling approach. The overarching hypothesis is that the exceptional non-responders may be less “RA-like” than patients who respond to TNFi, with fewer RA genetic risk alleles and classic RA features from the narrative notes. This definition provides a new way to sub- phenotype RA, focusing on those that will have a poor response to therapy. This study is significant because a screen will be helpful not only in the clinic but can also identify patients to target for future studies of novel drug targets. This approach is innovative because it considers contemporary data where patients now have more “opportunity” to fail 3 classes of bDMARDs, where in the past there were only a limited number available. These data will be examined both using traditional epidemiologic models and newer approaches such as topic modeling that can integrate a broader range of data types. Finally, this proposal is designed to anticipate a time when patients will come for their visit with genetic data as part of their medical record. PROJECT NARRATIVE Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common autoimmune joint disease worldwide. In line with NIAMS’ mission to conduct research in the treatment of arthritis, this proposal will investigate approaches using recent data and state-of-the-art approaches to improve RA management. In this proposal, we will define the poorly understood subgroup of RA patients where multiple therapies have been ineffective, enabling future studies to expand our understanding of inflammatory arthritis, and to inform discovery of novel treatment targets.",Studying exceptional treatment non-responders and genetics to predict treatment response in rheumatoid arthritis,10301407,R21AR078339,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Antirheumatic Agents', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Biological', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Cohort Studies', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease-Modifying Second-Line Drugs', 'Drug Costs', 'Drug Prescriptions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Gene Cluster', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Heterogeneity', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Insurance', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical Records', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Phenotype', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Risk-Taking', 'Spondylarthropathies', 'Subgroup', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Visit', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'demographics', 'design', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiological model', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic risk factor', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'innovation', 'joint inflammation', 'new therapeutic target', 'non-drug', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optimal treatments', 'patient screening', 'patient subsets', 'predicting response', 'response', 'risk variant', 'small molecule', 'success', 'supervised learning', 'treatment response']",NIAMS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2021,251507
"Sepsis Early Prediction and Subphenotype Illumination  Study (SEPSIS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sepsis, defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction in response to infection, is a devastating condition that contributes to up to half of hospital deaths and over $24 billion in healthcare costs in the U.S. annually. Over 750,000 patients develop sepsis in the U.S. each year, and survivors suffer long-term cognitive impairment and physical disability. Historically, sepsis research has focused on patients who are already critically ill. However, up to 50% of patients with sepsis receive their care on the inpatient wards, and only 10% of patients with sepsis are initially diagnosed in the intensive care unit (ICU). Because early intervention improves outcomes in sepsis, it is important to optimize the detection and treatment of sepsis outside the ICU.  The current sepsis paradigm has several problems. The first problem is that early identification of infection relies on clinician intuition, and caregivers often disagree regarding which patients are infected. This leads to delays in therapy and increased mortality in some patients and unnecessary therapies and adverse medication side effects in others. A second problem is that there is a lack of accurate tools to risk stratify infected patients outside the ICU after they are identified. Some patients with infection are treated outside the ICU and are later discharged home, while others develop life-threatening complications and die in the hospital. Accurate risk stratification of infected patients would bring additional critical care resources to the bedside of the high-risk patients that need them most. A third problem with the current sepsis paradigm is that it is often treated as a one-size-fits-all syndrome. However, patients with sepsis have a wide range of clinical presentations and outcomes due to the complex interactions between patient risk factors, the infectious organism, and the host immune response. These data suggest that the impact of timely and more aggressive interventions on outcomes may differ based on a patient's clinical phenotype. Identifying important subphenotypes of infected patients is critical to delivering more personalized care at the bedside.  The purpose of this project is to use data from the electronic health record and statistical modeling techniques to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this syndrome. In Aim 1, we will develop a novel tool for identifying infected patients outside the ICU using modern machine learning techniques. In Aim 2, we will develop a tool for risk stratifying infected patients outside the ICU using machine learning methods. Finally, in Aim 3 we will use cluster analysis techniques to determine whether the benefit of early and more aggressive interventions varies based on clinical phenotype. Our project will provide clinicians with powerful new tools to identify high-risk infected patients and important new subphenotypes of this common and deadly syndrome. This work will help to deliver early, life-saving care to the bedside of septic patients and lead to future interventional trials aimed at decreasing preventable death.

"Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease Project Summary  Cardiovascular disease negatively affects millions of people worldwide. Globally, it accounts for approximately thirty percent of all deaths. Furthermore, a significant fraction of deaths caused by cardiovascular disease occur in a non-geriatric population; fifteen percent of all worldwide deaths are attributed to cardiovascular disease for people under the age of seventy. Treatment to prevent cardiovascular events should be based on highly individualized risk prediction. High risk patients should get more aggressive treatments because the risk of disease outweighs the burden of treatment, while low risk patients should be managed more conservatively. For example, anti-thrombotic therapy for coronary heart disease may increase bleeding risk and may not be appropriate for low-risk patients. Two primary kinds of cardiovascular disease are stroke and coronary heart disease, and there have been a number of developments in risk scores for both ailments. However, these risk scores only use a small fraction of the available measurements about a patient and treat risk as a collection of independent factors rather than considering how their interactions amplify or ameliorate risk. Moreover, a majority of the popular coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores are designed to be manually computed by a busy physician at the point of care, which further limits their scope and fidelity. Next generation risk scores for stroke and cardiovascular disease should take into account all of the available information in the electronic health record without the constraints of the parametric assumptions of traditional risk modeling. More accurate risk assessment of coronary heart disease and stroke will lead to better care and reduce the cardiovascular disease burden.  Our vision is to capitalize on large collections of electronic health records along with recent advances in deep learning to build risk scores that use more available health information while making minimal mathematical assumptions about the nature of clinical risk. Our proposal propels the field from human computable independent risks calculations necessitated by previous limitations of technology to calculations that make use of deep learning to learn highly nonlinear risks and risk factor interactions. We additionally demonstrate how deep learning can be used to deal with the ever-present issue of missing values in medicine. Our proposal also targets an area under- explored by previous work on risk scores: fairness. Treatment quality is affected by the quality of risk estimation. This means populations where estimated risk is less accurate may receive worse care. Risk scores developed with simple models may only capture risk accurately for the majority population as simple models are not flexible enough to cover multiple populations. We seek to identify potential risk calculation differences with respect to race and ethnicity. We will construct and evaluate deep learning methods for coronary heart disease and stroke risk assessment from electronic health records. We will develop techniques to incorporate clinical text, handle missing data, and evaluate fairness of deep learning for cardiovascular risk scores. Finally, we will make our work available as open source code written in deep learning frameworks, at clinical conferences, and publications. Project Narrative Coronary heart disease and stroke create a large burden of disease in the world and require accurate risk assessment to aid in providing appropriate treatments. We will construct and validate deep learning risk scores for both coronary heart disease and stroke using large quantities of information from the electronic health record and take care to evaluate potential racial and ethnic biases present in the algorithm. More accurate coronary heart disease and stroke risk scores provided by this approach have the potential to reduce the overall cardiovascular disease burden with a specific focus on minority communities.",Deep probabilistic predictive models for stroke and coronary heart disease,10213130,R01HL148248,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Coronary heart disease', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Direct Costs', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Event', 'Future', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Productivity', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Series', 'Source Code', 'Statistical Models', 'Stroke', 'Survival Analysis', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Text', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Vision', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinical conference', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'ethnic bias', 'ethnic diversity', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'heart disease risk', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'minority communities', 'mortality', 'natural language', 'negative affect', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized risk prediction', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial bias', 'racial diversity', 'relating to nervous system', 'stroke model', 'stroke risk', 'thromboembolic stroke']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,673978
"iGLAMOUR Study:  Innovations in Glaucoma Adherence and monitoring Of Under-Represented minorities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Glaucoma affects more than 70 million people worldwide and is the world's leading cause of irreversible blindness. The only current method to delay its development and progression is by lowering intraocular pressure (IOP), achieved with topical administration of eyedrops. Adherence rates for glaucoma eyedrop administration are poor, in many cases below 50%, resulting in disease progression, eventual blindness, and a more than 2-fold increase in healthcare costs. African Americans and Latinos carry a significantly higher glaucoma burden compared with Caucasians. Minorities have additionally been found to have disproportionately lower rates of medication adherence. Previously studied interventions aimed at improving glaucoma adherence had key limitations that particularly affect minorities, including unreliable self-reported measures of adherence, lack of consideration of individual circumstances influencing glaucoma medication management, and developing/testing interventions in predominantly Caucasian populations. Health information technology has experienced rapid advancement in the last decade with the electronic health record (EHR), the proliferation of accessory mobile health technologies, and the advancement of artificial intelligence. Although their integration holds great promise to enable screening tools for diagnosis and risk prediction, successful integration to aid minority populations in real-world settings depends on: understanding how the collected information relates to the patient's other (e.g. clinical) data and the patient's socio-cultural context; seamless information exchange and interoperability with the EHR, the central portal of healthcare delivery; and integration of algorithmic findings into workflows involving both providers and patients to deliver information and/or recommendations in a simple, actionable manner. Glaucoma is a complex chronic disease, spanning decades of patients' lives and requiring ongoing monitoring and evaluation, thus making it an ideal application for the use of health IT to reduce racial disparities. In this proposal, we aim to accomplish this by: demonstrating the effectiveness of a flexible electronic eyedrop sensor to generate granular digital signatures of an individual's adherence and contextualizing this data in a socio- cultural context with patient interviews (Aim 1), combining adherence data with EHR variables to construct machine learning models to predict IOP control and enhance clinical risk stratification (Aim 2), and prototyping a dynamic dashboard for intervention coordination (Aim 3). Altogether, success of this innovative, comprehensive, culturally-tailored, and scalable health IT framework will improve medication adherence and slow disease progression among minorities, therefore narrowing this important racial health disparity. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans and Latinos carry a disproportionate burden of glaucoma, a blinding eye disease that can lead to severely decreased quality of life.

"Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home Abstract Heart failure (HF) is the most common cause for both hospitalizations and readmissions in the Medicare program. HF’s high mortality rate and high hospitalization utilization rate via readmissions results in a large economic burden currently estimated at over $30B, and prevalence of HF is expected to continue rising by 46% by 2030. There is an opportunity to deploy remote patient monitoring (RPM) tools for measuring prognostic biomarkers of worsening HF and acute decompensation and hospital readmission. Bender Tech (BT) has developed a urine testing platform capable of easily attaching to a home-toilet for accurate and easy collection of longitudinal health and behavior data without the requirement of manual sample collection and/or testing. We propose to adapt our system for use in elderly HF patient populations by rendering data collection and transmission completely passive. We propose to integrate sensors and firmware capable of identifying when a user has used their home toilet (Specific Aim 1), develop the machine learning (ML) classification algorithms necessary for determining when to perform a testing sequence (Specific Aim 2), and use ML methods to demonstrate feasibility of user biometric identification via urinary testing data (Specific Aim 3). A successful outcome of this proposal will be a set of classification models built using ML techniques designed to enable passive collection of longitudinal urine profile data from a home-toilet for use in remotely managing elderly HF patients. This will ready the product for prospective clinical trials that would be the subject of a future phase II submission for use in remotely monitoring diuretic effectiveness and preventing hospital readmissions. Project Narrative Remotely stratifying risk of worsening heart failure and predicting imminent decompensation and hospitalizations using remote patient monitoring devices can help lower healthcare costs and improve lives for the elderly living with heart failure at home. Longitudinal urinary trend data of physiologically important markers, such as spot sodium tests, have been shown to help classify potentially stable heart failure patients, predict acute decompensation, and measure diuretic effectiveness via relative changes from baseline measurements. Bender Tech proposes to integrate the hardware and machine learning methods necessary to render its internet- connected home urine testing platform completely passive to enable use by the elderly HF population and obviate any need for device interaction for data collection and transmission.","Machine learning techniques for passive, remote monitoring of elderly heart failure patients from home",10187779,R43HL157937,"['Acute', 'Biometry', 'Cardiology', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Defecation', 'Devices', 'Diuretics', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'European', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health behavior', 'Heart failure', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicare', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Potassium', 'Prevalence', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Sleep', 'Societies', 'Sodium', 'Specificity', 'Spottings', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Treatment Failure', 'Urination', 'Urine', 'Use Effectiveness', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical decision support', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'design', 'experience', 'health data', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'interest', 'machine learning method', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'patient monitoring device', 'patient population', 'prevent', 'programs', 'prospective', 'remote monitoring', 'remote patient monitoring', 'risk stratification', 'sample collection', 'sensor', 'tool', 'trend', 'unsupervised learning', 'urinary']",NHLBI,"BENDER TECH, LLC",R43,2021,224996
"Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment Postoperative complications and readmissions rates are higher in minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) patients. Low SES is associated with frailty, one of the best predictors of 30-day postoperative complications and early hospital readmission. Despite their influence on health outcomes, frailty and social risk factors are not considered in risk adjustment for reimbursement and quality measures. CMS developed financial incentive- based programs to improve quality of care. Yet this strategy disproportionately penalizes minority-serving, major teaching and safety net hospitals (SNH), further constraining resources for the care of vulnerable populations. Our long-term goal is to use frailty and social risk factors to identify at-risk patients to design more effective clinical care pathways. Frailty can be derived retrospectively using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) dataset. Data networks are powerful research tools that can be used to answer important questions. However, extracting data from EHR is challenging. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) developed 13 Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRN) that have considerable overlapping membership with Clinical Translational Science Award (CTSA) institutions. While steady progress has been made, multiple barriers exist to efficiently access and use data. We will engage 3 CTSA hubs, each members of a different CDRN, to locally merge identified datasets developing data accessing and linking strategies at diverse institutions for dissemination across sites within CDRNs and to ultimately perform similar studies across CDRNs. We will use the SMART IRB reliance platform to harmonize the regulatory approval process as much as possible for each step of this project to identify barriers to use in data networks. We propose the following Aims: 1) Determine the predictive power of ethnicity, race, SES, and frailty for postoperative complications, mortality  and readmissions to improve risk adjustment at 3 CTSA/CDRNs 2) Estimate postoperative functional status using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning  algorithms on inpatient physical therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and nursing notes for ACS NSQIP  patients to predict long-term functional status 3) Develop methods to predict long-term loss of independence after major surgery 4) Determine hospital resource utilization stratified by SES, frailty and minority status The significance of our study is the incorporation of social risk factors, frailty and functional status in risk adjustment forming the basis for future interventions by targeting patients at the highest risk for postoperative complications and reducing health care disparities. Our innovative approach harnesses data sources at diverse institutions with the goal of disseminating these methods across 3 CDRNs and the CTSA network. Project Narrative: Patients with social risk factors, including poverty, being a minority, lack of an education and frailty are all associated with having worse health outcomes and with more difficulties recovering after surgical procedures. Safety net hospitals take care of many people with social risk factors and are being judged on the quality of care provided without accounting for the challenges faced by poor people. We will study the effect of social risk factors and frailty on health outcomes after surgery to identify patients that would benefit from care pathways that help poor and/or frail people.","Harnessing the power of CTSA-CDRN data networks: Using social determinants of health, frailty and functional status to identify at-risk patients and improve risk adjustment",10199784,U01TR002393,"['Accounting', 'Agreement', 'Ambulatory Care Facilities', 'American', 'American College of Surgeons', 'Authorization documentation', 'Caring', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical and Translational Science Awards', 'Community Surveys', 'Costs and Benefits', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Education', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fibrinogen', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hispanics', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Occupational Therapy', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physical therapy', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Postoperative Period', 'Poverty', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of Care', 'Race', 'Recovery of Function', 'Registries', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Adjustment', 'Risk Factors', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Testing', 'Text', 'United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'base', 'clinical care', 'cost effective', 'data access', 'design', 'electronic data', 'financial incentive', 'frailty', 'functional status', 'health care disparity', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'incentive program', 'innovation', 'low socioeconomic status', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'payment', 'postoperative recovery', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'readmission rates', 'safety net', 'simulation', 'social', 'social health determinants', 'tool', 'usability']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,U01,2021,100000

"Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques Despite their adverse impact on patient quality of life and healthcare utilization and costs, symptom clusters (SCs) in common adult chronic conditions such as cancer, heart failure (HF), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are understudied and poorly understood. The lack of access to real world, longitudinal patient symptom data sets and inability to adequately model the complexity of SCs has greatly limited research. Based on our previous work, we propose that these gaps can be addressed in an innovative way using electronic health records (EHRs) and data science techniques. Our overall objective is to develop, apply and refine, and implement an optimized data processing and analysis pipeline for the characterization of SCs in common adult chronic conditions for use with EHR data. We hypothesize that a core set of SCs is shared among all common adult chronic conditions and that distinct SCs characterize specific conditions and/or treatments. The long term training goal of this project is to assist Dr. Koleck in becoming an independent investigator conducting a program of research dedicated to mitigating symptom burden in patients with chronic conditions through use of informatics and omics (e.g., genomics and proteomics), the focus of her pre-doctoral work. Using exceptional resources available from Columbia University, the K99 phase of this project will focus on the development of a rigorous pipeline; essential competencies in SC analysis and interpretation; and the data science techniques of clinical data mining, natural language processing, machine learning, and data visualization. In the R00 phase, Dr. Koleck will independently implement the pipeline in another medical center to determine the reproducibility of identified SCs and begin to explore clinical predictors (e.g., socio-demographics, laboratory results, and medications) of SCs. The specific aims are to 1) develop a data-driven pipeline for the characterization of SCs from EHRs using a cohort of adult patients diagnosed with cancer, as SCs have been most systematically characterized in this condition; 2) apply the pipeline to three other common adult chronic conditions that share biological and behavioral risk factors with cancer, i.e., HF, T2DM, and COPD, and evaluate SCs in these conditions; and 3) determine if SCs differ for cancer, HF, T2DM, and COPD when implementing the pipeline within another medical center and explore clinically relevant, EHR- documented predictors of identified SCs. To accomplish research aims and training goals, an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in symptom science, biomedical informatics, data science, pertinent clinical domains, and career development mentorship has been assembled. This research is significant because a pipeline that accommodates the format in which symptom data is already being documented in EHRs has the potential to greatly accelerate the acquisition of SC knowledge and expedite clinical translation of symptom mitigation strategies. Given the array of new competencies to be developed, this K99/R00 award is necessary for achieving the candidate’s career goal of advancing chronic condition symptom science. The proposed research is relevant to public health because adult patients diagnosed with chronic conditions are frequently burdened by two or more co-occurring, related symptoms. Development of an optimized process to study multiple symptoms collected in patient electronic health records has the potential to lead to new knowledge and improved symptom management. The proposed research addresses the NINR theme of “symptom science” and a key area in the NINR Strategic Plan, “taking advantage of innovations in data science in order to develop interventions to promote health and wellness that are leading-edge, effective, and translatable to clinical practice.”",Advancing Chronic Condition Symptom Cluster Science Through Use of Electronic Health Records and Data Science Techniques,10171921,R00NR017651,"['18 year old', 'Academic Medical Centers', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Advance Directives', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Code', 'Competence', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Data Store', 'Depressed mood', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dyspnea', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Equipment and supply inventories', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fatigue', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Impaired cognition', 'Informatics', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge acquisition', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mastectomy', 'Medical Genetics', 'Medical center', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nausea', 'Nausea and Vomiting', 'Neurobehavioral Manifestations', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Oncology', 'Pain', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting', 'Procedures', 'Proteomics', 'Pruritus', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk Factors', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Woman', 'Work', 'Xerostomia', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical data warehouse', 'clinical practice', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data mining', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'health care service utilization', 'health data', 'innovation', 'knowledge translation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'patient oriented', 'pre-doctoral', 'process optimization', 'programs', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'symptom cluster', 'symptom management', 'symptom science', 'symptomatic improvement', 'unsupervised learning']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2021,241411
"DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES ABSTRACT Anti-TNF therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic inflammation of the digestive system which presents both an economic burden as well as prominent disability and morbidity. These therapies, however, are largely ineffective in IBD patients, with primary non- response rates varying from 10-30%, and with 23-46% of patients losing response over time. They also lead to adverse health outcomes including increased risk of infections (most notably reactivation of tuberculosis), liver problems, arthritis, and lymphoma. Due to biologic switching where multiple drugs are tried in sequence until an effect is observed, they often lead to overall increased healthcare costs. There is no clear predictive factor of response or loss of response to anti-TNF therapies, with current research focusing on efficacious dosage and inhibitor selection. While numerous predictors of response have been identified in studies, none are robust enough to impact clinical practice. Overcoming this gap in the administration of anti-TNF therapies will be an important next step in improving their utility and reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality. This project proposes a multicohort meta-analysis and machine learning approach to discover and validate a prognostic gene signature that can differentiate anti-TNF responders from non-responders in IBD patients, allowing for improved decision-making and positive health outcomes. Despite the broad biological, clinical, and technical heterogeneity inherent in such a task, the Inflammatix analytical framework was able to identify significant differentially expressed genes that discriminate anti-TNF responders from non-responders (mean discovery AUC of ~0.83 and mean validation AUC of ~0.81). Supported by these preliminary results, this project will (1) discover a robust, clinically translatable multi-gene prognostic signature using publicly available datasets, (2) generate independent gene expression data from retrospective cohorts of mucosal biopsy samples (n=150) to validate the signature (target AUC > ~0.8), and (3) use our proprietary Inflammatix machine learning (IML) platform to train and validate a plethora of machine learning algorithms to develop a robust, generalizable classifier (target AUC ~ 0.8 - 0.9) that is ready for clinical validation via prospective studies. Our novel prognostic signature will transform the clinical paradigm in the use and administration of anti-TNF therapies, maximizing treatment benefit while minimizing patient exposure to potentially harmful side effects and adverse health outcomes, consequently reducing financial burden for the healthcare system and patient. NARRATIVE Anti-TNF therapies are widely used to treat autoimmune diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), however, they are ineffective in greater than half of patients, and carry significant risks with associated healthcare costs. This project will discover and validate a prognostic, generalizable mRNA signature that can identify IBD patients who are likely to respond to anti-TNF treatment, transforming how physicians use and administer these expensive and oftentimes risk-laden therapies to maximize patient benefit and minimize adverse health outcomes. Improved treatment decision-making will undoubtedly help address ever-increasing cases of IBD in the US and globally while reducing overall healthcare costs, morbidity, and mortality.",DEVELOPMENT OF BASELINE GENE EXPRESSION-BASED RESPONSE PREDICTOR FOR ANTI-TNFA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES,10138841,R43DK127578,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Therapy', 'Arthritis', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Colonoscopy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Economic Burden', 'Exposure to', 'Financial Hardship', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Health', 'Health Care Costs', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Liver', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphoma', 'Machine Learning', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Privatization', 'Prospective Studies', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Robin bird', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Standardization', 'TNF gene', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tuberculosis', 'Validation', 'acute infection', 'adjudicate', 'adjudication', 'base', 'bioinformatics pipeline', 'clinical development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically translatable', 'cost', 'cytokine', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'dosage', 'gastrointestinal system', 'genetic signature', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'instrument', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mortality', 'multilayer perceptron', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'predictive marker', 'predictive signature', 'prognostic', 'prognostic signature', 'responders and non-responders', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'service providers', 'side effect', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment response']",NIDDK,"INFLAMMATIX, INC.",R43,2021,251371
"Rapid platelet dysfunction detection in whole blood samples using machine learning powered micro-clot imaging. Abstract This project will optimize a point-of-care (POC) platelet force monitoring technology for clinical application in trauma care. The leading causes of death and disability after trauma are related to hemorrhage and traumatic brain injury with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). Platelets are critical to hemostasis by inducing clot formation via adhesion, aggregation, and contraction at wounds. Platelets often become dysfunctional after trauma which worsens internal bleeding and ICH progression and increasing morbidity. POC platelet assays have not been incorporated in practice due to:1) lack of large cohort ED patient testing; 2) poor accuracy in transfusion prediction and 3) extended processing times. We have made an innovative POC technology to test platelet function by directly measuring platelet contractile forces on microfluidic force sensors. Advantages of our POC test vs. existing assays: 1) rapid, direct activation and measures of platelet functions and 2) innovative machine vision with deep potential for machine learning insight. However, this technology needs optimization and validation in a large major ED trauma cohort and remains untested after ICH. Our pilot data suggests platelet contractile forces are sensitive to a range of relevant activation pathways and mechanisms and force is significantly decreased in trauma patients requiring blood transfusion. Further, in prior clinical trials, platelet transfusion has been found to be harmful when used indiscriminately. Building on this unmet scientific need, we will determine if our POC technology is predictive of hemorrhagic complications in trauma patients, informing a personalized transfusion strategy. Our overarching hypothesis is our POC platelet force monitor technology is an efficient indicator of bleeding complications after trauma and ICH. Aim 1: Optimize the platelet force monitor optics to improve platelet force sensor performance. We hypothesize the addition of a second fluorescent imaging channel can improve our current platelet force sensor performance. Aim 2: Use machine learning (ML) image analysis to improve detection of platelet dysfunction and prediction of trauma outcomes. We hypothesize image-based ML models can improve test performance. We will compare the accuracy of direct platelet force measurements (Aim 1) vs. ML-enhancement measurements for detecting platelet dysfunction and predicting outcomes. Aim 3: Validate our platelet function algorithm for predicting blood transfusion needs, mortality, and the progression of traumatic ICH in a prospective cohort of severely-injured ED trauma patients. We hypothesize platelet force will be a powerful predictor of blood transfusion needs, mortality, and progression of ICH. In the ED we will apply our algorithm (both the original and optimized algorithm from Aim 1) to blood from trauma patients and compare the predicted transfusion requirements against actual transfusion (Aim-3a) and measure the association between measured platelet force and ICH progression (Aim-3b). Project Narrative Rapidly identifying patients who are at risk for traumatic internal and intracranial bleeding would improve care by enabling personalized transfusion strategies. The current clinical approach causes undue morbidity and mortality because of late identification of those in need of a transfusion, resulting in delayed blood transfusion in those patients who would benefit, and unnecessary transfusions in those who would not. The proposed project improves and validates an innovative blood testing technology which has shown the potential to make rapid bleeding assessment of every patient both easy and accurate.",Rapid platelet dysfunction detection in whole blood samples using machine learning powered micro-clot imaging.,10146213,R61HL156508,"['ADP Receptors', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Arachidonic Acids', 'Bedside Testings', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood Tests', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Blood coagulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Care Technology Points', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Color', 'Complex', 'Contracts', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Electrons', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Freezing', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemostatic function', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medicine', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Platelet Function Tests', 'Platelet Transfusion', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Prospective cohort', 'Receptor Inhibition', 'Reporting', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transfusion', 'Trauma', 'Trauma patient', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic injury', 'Traumatic intracranial hemorrhage', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'blood product', 'clinical application', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'design', 'diagnostic assay', 'diagnostic technologies', 'disability', 'flexibility', 'fluorescence imaging', 'force sensor', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine vision', 'microsensor', 'mortality', 'nanonewton', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'performance tests', 'platelet function', 'point of care', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'seal', 'sensor', 'severe injury', 'shear stress', 'trauma care', 'wound']",NHLBI,STASYS MEDICAL CORPORATION,R61,2021,294185
"Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics PROJECT SUMMARY Given the growing burden of antimicrobial resistance (AR) and lack of effective therapies for multi-drug resistant organisms, the development of new tools or models which risk-stratify patients for colonization and infection by AR bacteria is of paramount importance, particularly in high-risk populations. The significance of the gut microbiome in mediating colonization resistance against drug resistant pathogens as well as the role of microbiota-depleting antibiotics in the development of AR infections is being increasingly appreciated. However, there is currently a deficiency of methods integrating microbiome and antibiotic factors into AR- predictive algorithms. Thus, the overall objective of the proposed research is to improve understanding of the factors driving the epidemiology of AR-colonization and infection by incorporating metagenomic and antibiotic administration data of a well-defined clinical cohort. In this proposal, we focus on patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (from whom we have already collected extensive longitudinal stool samples and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing) because of the high rates of AR pathogen colonization and severe risk for infection. The overarching hypothesis that will be tested is that the baseline presence of a limited number of key bacterial species and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are critical for the risk of colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen when combined with the administration of specific antimicrobials. We will begin our research by comprehensively determining the epidemiology of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection in our cohort via culture based stool sample analyses and clinical chart review, respectively. Using shotgun metagenomics, we will establish whether the baseline intestinal microbiome species and resistome characteristics are associated with the acquisition of AR pathogens colonizing or causing infection. Similarly, we will ascertain the relationship between antimicrobial exposure, microbiome disruption, and subsequent AR emergence. The data from these studies will be integrated into Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) models to improve the prediction of AR pathogen colonization and AR infection outcomes. The proposed career development award, which utilizes the expertise of a superlative mentorship team and a uniquely designed research and training plan, will enable me the opportunity to build upon my current expertise in microbiology, genomics, and molecular epidemiology by adding advanced training in shotgun metagenomic analyses, bioinformatics, and biostatistical modeling. Moreover, the numerous resources and support provided by my institution and mentoring team will ensure my successful transition to an independent investigator as well as establish a strong foundation for my long-term goals of understanding and mitigating the impact of antimicrobial resistance in human health via integration of multiple –omics platforms and provision of personalized genomic-based medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Antibiotic resistant (AR) infections are one of the most serious public health threats and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, particularly in immunocompromised patients. The proposed research will use a combination of culture-based techniques and high-throughput approaches to determine the epidemiology of colonization and infectious events by AR-pathogens, characterize the gut microbiome, and mine clinical data of acute leukemia patients receiving chemotherapy in order to identify microbial species, antibiotic resistance genes, patient features, and antibiotic administration factors that affect the risk for colonization and/or infection with an AR pathogen. The ultimate goal of the proposed research is to exploit metagenomics as an epidemiological tool for understanding susceptibility to AR outcomes and to build predictive risk models which can be potentially incorporated into prevention and intervention strategies to mitigate AR infection events in high-risk patients.",Identifying Risk Factors for Antibiotic Resistance via Integration of Epidemiology and Metagenomics,10300376,K01AI143881,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Acute leukemia', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anti-Infective Agents', 'Antibiotic Resistance', 'Antibiotics', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Area', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biometry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Epidemiology', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hematologic Neoplasms', 'Human', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Infection', 'Infection Control', 'Institution', 'Intestines', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal cohort study', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metadata', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Microbiology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Public Health', 'ROC Curve', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resistance to infection', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shotguns', 'Source', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'antibiotic resistant infections', 'antimicrobial', 'bacterial resistance', 'base', 'career', 'chemotherapy', 'cohort', 'colonization resistance', 'commensal microbes', 'drug resistant pathogen', 'effective therapy', 'emerging antimicrobial resistance', 'genomic epidemiology', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'leukemia', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'mortality', 'multi-drug resistant pathogen', 'multiple omics', 'pathogen', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'rRNA Genes', 'random forest', 'resistance gene', 'risk stratification', 'skills', 'stool sample', 'tool']",NIAID,TEXAS A&M AGRILIFE RESEARCH,K01,2021,108000
"A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data SUMMARY: A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict AAA Prognosis  Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a localized dilatation of the aorta. If left untreated AAA may go on to rupture, an occurrence which has a 90% mortality rate and is the 13th leading cause of death in the United States, with more than 15,000 annual deaths reported annually. After AAA is diagnosed, a clinician must determine its severity; i.e., the relative risk of rupture compared to the risk of intervention. Current clinical guidelines for this determination is based on the one-size-fits-all “maximum diameter criterion”, which states that when a AAA reaches 5.5 cm in diameter, the risk of rupture necessitates repair of the aneurysm. However, smaller sized AAAs (< 5.5 cm) have been seen to rupture at rates of up to 23.4%, demonstrating that this diameter-based criterion is unsuitable for AAA management. A recently completed NIH-funded clinical trial, 1U01-AG037120: “Non-Invasive Treatment of AAA Clinical Trial” (N-TA3CT) was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of pharmacologic treatment of small AAA. During this trial, a highly unique and valuable dataset was collected longitudinally every 6 months for a 3-year period for patients presenting with small AAA.  This proposal is designed to test the hypothesis that, at the time of discovery of small AAA, clinical prognosis – i.e., predicting if and when clinical intervention will be required based on rupture risk metrics – can be facilitated using machine learning-based algorithms using real-time biomechanical, morphological, and clinical data. To address this hypothesis, we will pursue two specific aims.  Aim 1 will be to quantify the “evolution” of individual small AAA from the N-TA3CT trial. The biomechanical and morphological status of all patient AAAs at each timepoint will be determined from data collected during the trial using finite element analysis and morphometric analysis, respectively, and these will be tabulated along with clinical indices for each AAA at each timepoint.  Aim 2 will be to develop and validate machine learning and regression techniques to forecast the clinical prognosis of small AAA. The data from Aim 1 as well as follow-up reporting data from the N- TA3CT trial will be used to train machine learning classification models to determine whether aneurysm prognosis can be accurately predicted. Validation will be performed on a subset of data to assess the accuracy, sensitivity, precision and specificity of the proposed prediction model.  The unique dataset from the N-TA3CT trial, paired with the extensive experience of and methods developed by our lab, will allow us, for the first time, to carefully examine and quantify the natural evolution of small AAA and to subsequently develop a predictive model to improve patient prognosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Currently, when clinicians must decide if or when to fix an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA; characterized by the ballooning of a thin and weakened wall), they base their decision solely on the AAA diameter. However, a quarter of AAA below the accepted cutoff diameter still rupture, often leading to death. In this project, we will use a unique database collected during a clinical trial of small AAA, computer models, and machine learning to create a new decision method that will better serve patients with this disease.",A Machine Learning-Based Clinical Decision Support Tool to Predict Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Prognosis Using Existing Longitudinal Data,10115365,R21HL156246,"['Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Aneurysm', 'Annual Reports', 'Aorta', 'Biomechanics', 'Caliber', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Dilatation - action', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Rupture', 'Ruptured Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Methods', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'design', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'follow-up', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'predictive modeling', 'rate of change', 'repaired', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R21,2021,117375
"Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a common and highly lethal health problem, affecting 10-15% of all hospitalized patients and >50% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs). It has been shown that a small increase in serum creatinine (SCr) of ≥0.5 mg/dl was associated with a 6.5-fold increase in the odds of death, a 3.5-day increase in length of stay, and nearly $7,500 in excess hospital costs. Unfortunately, no specific treatment exists to cure AKI once it has developed. The ability to predict AKI in hospitalized patients would provide clinicians the opportunity to modify care pathways and implement interventions, which could in turn prevent AKI and yield better outcomes. Although electronic medical record (EMR) based monitoring systems for AKI have led to expedited interventions and may increase the percentage of patients returning to baseline kidney function, most of these systems are reactive rather than proactive, with little or no contribution to AKI prevention. Moreover, our current knowledge of AKI risk factors is far from complete, especially in the ICU and general inpatient populations, characterized by numerous deficiencies and systematic failings that may be avoidable To transform the reactive AKI care to proactive and personalized care, early identification of high risk patients and better understanding of individual modifiable risk factors for AKI is the key. In Aim 1, to discover novel risk factors predictive of AKI, we propose to develop an ensemble multi-view feature selection framework to simultaneously consider the differences and interrelations between feature spaces and obtain robust knowledge by synthesizing findings from diverse patient populations across multiple institutions in nine US states. In Aim 2, to discover general modifiable causes of AKI to help physicians design more effective AKI prevention policies, we propose to develop a novel multi-cause inference method to identify causal relationships between modifiable factors and AKI for susceptible patient subgroups. In Aim 3, to explain what caused AKI in individual patients to support physicians in designing personalized AKI intervention, we propose to develop a new causal explanation method by integrating causal inference and case based reasoning to quantify patient-level causal significance of modifiable factors. The proposed study will have a significant clinical impact by not only expanding the capacity of clinicians to identify high risk patients for AKI early and advancing the general knowledge on causal and modifiable risk factors for AKI but also supporting personalized AKI intervention with suggestions on potential patient-specific actionable items. The work will not only advance AKI but also the machine learning and clinical research informatics community and the methodology developed is generalizable to other clinical domains. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is to identify clinical risk factors of acute kidney injury (AKI) in hospitalized patients from electronic medical records (EMRs) with machine learning. AKI risk factors discovered from EMR of diverse populations from multiple institutions across nine US states will be reliable and robust and can assist clinicians in providing proactive and personalized care to high-risk patients.",Identifying Personalized Risk of Acute Kidney Injury with Machine Learning,10200790,R01DK116986,"['Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Creatinine', 'Data', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early identification', 'Elderly', 'Event', 'Exposure to', 'Geographic Locations', 'Geographic state', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Inpatients', 'Institution', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Length of Stay', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial', 'Outcome', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Predictive Factor', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sepsis', 'Series', 'Serum', 'Suggestion', 'System', 'Time', 'Work', 'adjudication', 'base', 'case-based', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'design', 'feature selection', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'injury prevention', 'machine learning algorithm', 'modifiable risk', 'mortality risk', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'prevent', 'risk prediction']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,506211
"Improving the efficiency of randomized trials of behavioral interventions for acute and chronic respiratory failure The goal of this Midcareer Investigator Award in Patient-Oriented Research is to enhance the ability of Dr. Scott Halpern to mentor students, residents, post-doctoral fellows, and junior faculty in developing and testing behavioral economic interventions to prevent and improve outcomes following, acute and chronic respiratory failure. Patients with many forms of acute and chronic respiratory failure, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), respectively, are at high risk of death and suffer considerable short- and long-term impairments in quality of life and functioning. Behavioral interventions, including those informed by behavioral economic principles, hold great promise for preventing these conditions and improving outcomes. Yet the knowledge produced by randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of such interventions is limited due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcomes ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analyses to determine which interventions work best for which patients. By leveraging the conceptual models, research infrastructures, and data collected in 5 of Dr. Halpern's ongoing or recently completed RCTs including 40,000 patients, Dr. Halpern and his mentees will develop and test ways to surmount each of these three barriers to producing greater knowledge on how to prevent and treat acute and chronic respiratory failure. First, they will conduct randomized trials of “nudges” to improve enrollment and retention in real RCTs. Second, they will learn and apply state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to enhance the ability to extract patient-centered outcomes from electronic health records, thereby identifying more efficient methods for outcome ascertainment in large, pragmatic RCTs. Third, they will learn and apply modern methods in causal inference and the detection of heterogeneous treatment effects to better understand how effective behavioral interventions are overall, how efficacious they would be if more patients adhered to them, and which interventions work best for which patients. These scientific aims will be completed within the context of a structured training program designed to improve Dr. Halpern's skills in mentoring junior patient-oriented researchers. Dr. Halpern has already successfully mentored more than two dozen patient-oriented researchers. However, by enabling him to reduce his clinical and administrative commitments, this award will increase the time he commits to mentoring, and will improve his mentoring skills by supporting didactic training in influence and leadership and “mentor-the-mentor” meetings with more senior mentors. The award will also enable him to develop a “Junior Faculty Visiting Professor Program in Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,” thereby enhancing opportunities for his and other established investigators' mentees to network with other leaders in the field, receive external feedback and mentorship, and gain the confidence that comes with speaking to less familiar audiences. NARRATIVE Randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions are essential to the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic respiratory failure. However, the efficiency of such trials, defined as the knowledge gained divided by the costs of completing the trials, is often quite low due to impediments to patient accrual, patient-centered outcome ascertainment, and the abilities of traditional analytic approaches to determine which interventions work best for which patients.

"Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis Project Summary/Abstract Lyme Disease is a tickborne illness with markedly increasing prevalence in the United States and an urgent need for improved diagnostics in its early stages, when treatment is most efficient. While classic clinical presentation of the early illness is the presence of erythema migrans (EM), or “bullseye rash”, surrounding the tick bite site, 20-30% of patients do not present with EM. Further complicating diagnosis is a proportion of patients who present with EM, but are seronegative on the current standard two-tiered test algorithm (STTTA). The proposed research addresses the need for improved serological tests to diagnose early Lyme Disease in these patients, while the disease is the most responsive to treatment. A proof-of-concept antigen panel capable of distinguishing STTTA-positive acute Lyme samples from endemic controls was identified using a novel antigen discovery approach. This approach relies on representing an entire binding space of a donor’s circulating antibody repertoire using machine learning models based on the antibody binding profile to a diverse, random library of 126,050 peptides with an average length of 9 amino acids, which is a sparse representation of all possible amino acid combinations. Resulting models are then used to identify pathogen epitopes with high predictive power that are combined into a panel with diagnostic efficacy. Here, the unmet need of diagnosing early Lyme disease in STTTA-seronegative patients is addressed by the addition of antigens predicted as specific to this patient population. Diagnostic efficacy of the supplemented proof-of- concept antigen panel, that was identified in a previous proof-of-principle study, will be tested using an expanded cohort of STTTA seronegative donors and endemic controls. Specificity of the panel for Lyme disease will be confirmed using a panel of look-a-like illnesses including autoimmune diseases and tickborne diseases. This work is expected to yield data demonstrating the feasibility of a novel immunoassay for the diagnosis of early stage Lyme Disease patients currently missed by present tests. Additionally, it will serve as a demonstration of the antigen discovery approach as a means to identify diagnostic antigens for difficult pathogens. Project Narrative Improved diagnostics for early Lyme Disease, the most treatable stage of the disease, are urgently needed to identify infected patients, including those not presenting with the classic bullseye rash or who are seronegative on the standard two-tiered test algorithm. Here, we apply a novel antigen discovery approach that allows us to computationally model patients’ serum antibody binding profiles and predict diagnostic antigens for patients with early Lyme Disease. By developing a diagnostic assay which includes antigens specific for patients missed by current diagnostics, patient outcomes can be improved through enabling early intervention with effective treatments.",Machine learning-based development of serologic test for acute Lyme disease diagnosis,10259497,R43AI162473,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Antibody Repertoire', 'Antigens', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Binding', 'Borrelia burgdorferi', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Computer Models', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Differential Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Ensure', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Exanthema', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immunoassay', 'Immunology', 'Incidence', 'Laboratories', 'Length', 'Libraries', 'Lyme Disease', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peptides', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prevalence', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Serology', 'Serology test', 'Serum', 'Services', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Surface Antigens', 'Symptoms', 'Synthetic Antigens', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tick-Borne Diseases', 'United States', 'Work', 'antigen diagnostic', 'base', 'biomarker panel', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical diagnostics', 'cohort', 'computerized tools', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'density', 'design', 'diagnosis standard', 'diagnostic assay', 'disease diagnosis', 'effective therapy', 'erythema migrans', 'falls', 'improved', 'in silico', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'molecular diagnostics', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'pathogen', 'patient population', 'response', 'seasonal influenza', 'synthetic peptide', 'technological innovation', 'tick bite', 'tick-borne']",NIAID,BIOMORPH TECHNOLOGIES LLC,R43,2021,300000
"Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring Abstract Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). Both hypotension and hypertension can impair the function of vital organs (e.g. brain, heart and kidneys), and intraoperative hypotension is associated with postoperative mortality, which makes it important to detect BP changes as quickly as possible to prompt timely intervention or therapy. However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, an invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection. In the United States, about 80,000 blood stream infections caused by an arterial catheter are reported annually. Due to the inherent risks associated with a-line, it is used only for clinically indicated high risk surgeries or ICU patients. As a result of the a-line risks and discomforts, even though more than 300 million surgeries are performed worldwide each year, only a small portion receive continuous BP monitoring. In addition, although vital sign (ECG, pulse oximetry, BP etc) monitoring is routine in surgical rooms and ICUs, currently most monitoring devices are fixed in individual rooms, which result in gaps in patient monitoring, accidents during patient transport process, and extra work to disconnect and reconnect sensors when leaving and entering a new facility. Seamless “continuum of care” monitoring—for instance from surgical room to ICUs, including transport in between and without reconnecting sensors—is on top of the wish list by clinician. In recent years, efforts have been made to develop portable ECG monitors and “mobile ICUs”; however so far, no continuous and seamless BP monitoring has been achieved. This proposal fully leverages the outcomes from the related R21 (EB022271) project. We will develop novel machine learning and deep learning based data fusion algorithms to use existing vital signs for continuous BP monitoring, then integrate them with our unique wearable patient monitoring system to form a novel perioperative patient monitoring system. We will test the system’s performance against gold standard a- line and Finapres BP technologies. to develop a fully functional technology for noninvasive, continuous, and seamless BP monitoring. We will also develop a public database for future BP technology development. The proposed multimodality algorithms, seamless BP monitoring system and PhysioNet database will provide major steps forward to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring. Project Narrative Continuous blood pressure (BP) is one of the most critical monitoring parameters during anesthesia, surgery and in intensive care units (ICU). However, the current gold standard technology for BP monitoring, the invasive arterial line (a-line), causes patient suffering (physical pain) and increases the risk of infection, and current noninvasive BP technologies have poor stability. In this project we will develop novel algorithms and hardware with improved stability to meet the clinical need for noninvasive continuous BP monitoring,",Wearable Multi-modality Cuffless Blood Pressure Monitoring,10121622,R01EB027122,"['Academia', 'Accidents', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Annual Reports', 'Arterial Lines', 'Benchmarking', 'Blood', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood Pressure Monitors', 'Brain', 'Cardiac Surgery procedures', 'Catheters', 'Clinical', 'Continuity of Patient Care', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Hypotension', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Infection', 'Intensive Care Units', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient Monitoring System', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perioperative', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Postoperative Period', 'Process', 'Pulse Oximetry', 'Risk', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stream', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temporal Arteries', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Transport Process', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'data format', 'data fusion', 'data privacy', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'feature extraction', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'infection risk', 'light weight', 'monitoring device', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'patient privacy', 'portability', 'privacy protection', 'recurrent neural network', 'sensor', 'surgical risk', 'technology development', 'tonometry']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,595683
"Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography PROJECT SUMMARY Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide, and more than half of the individuals suffering myocardial infarction (heart attacks) have no premonitory symptoms. Studies of patients with coronary artery disease have traditionally focused only on the severity of narrowing (stenosis) of the coronary arteries by atherosclerotic plaques, rather than the adverse features of coronary plaques which are predisposed to rupture and precipitate myocardial infarction. Coronary CT Angiography (CTA) is a noninvasive test that allows assessment of both coronary stenosis and plaque characteristics. Currently, however, CTA is interpreted visually for stenosis. Quantitative measurements of CTA stenosis severity and plaque features are not part of current clinical routine.  We propose to develop novel image processing algorithms for fully automated, robust quantification of coronary plaque features from CTA. We also propose to automatically quantify the characteristics of adipose tissue around the coronary arteries (pericoronary adipose tissue, PCAT), which have been shown to differentiate rupture-prone, high-risk coronary plaques from stable ones. We propose to apply machine learning methods to efficiently combine stenosis, plaque and PCAT features, along with patient clinical data, into a new integrated risk score for the prediction of future adverse cardiovascular events. We will evaluate this risk score in the real-world, prospective, landmark SCOT-HEART trial (including all 2073 patients in the CTA arm of the trial), with added external validation in large multicenter patient registries, with available CTA scans, clinical data, and followup for cardiovascular events (fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death in a grand total of 7844 patients). We propose three specific aims: 1) To refine, expand and automate measurements of coronary plaque and lumen for the entire coronary artery tree, and to standardize measurement of plaque changes in serial CTA; 2) To evaluate the prognostic value of automatically-quantified plaque features and PCAT characteristics for the prediction of future MACE in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries; 3) To develop and evaluate with full external validation a new automated patient risk score—combining patient clinical data, CTA-measured quantitative plaque features and PCAT characteristics, using machine learning—for the prediction of future MACE events in the prospective SCOT-HEART trial and multicenter CTA registries.  The proposed work will enable automated, multi-faceted and reproducible analysis of plaque, stenosis and PCAT from CTA, combined with objective risk scores reflecting likelihood of adverse cardiovascular events. This work will provide a novel, personalized, real-world paradigm that objectively and accurately identifies individual patients at risk of future cardiovascular events, from routine CTA imaging. PROJECT NARRATIVE (lay language) In patients who are at risk of developing a heart attack, imaging of the heart with coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) allows doctors to noninvasively assess the narrowing of the coronary arteries caused by coronary plaque deposits, as well as the coronary plaques themselves. The researchers propose to develop and validate novel computerized scores derived from real-world CTA and clinical patient data using artificial intelligence, that will automatically identify the patients who are at highest risk of suffering a heart attack or cardiovascular death. This new research will allow physicians to more precisely identify patients for whom appropriate treatment could be prescribed, to reduce their risk of future adverse cardiovascular events.",Integrated prediction of cardiovascular events by automated coronary plaque and pericoronary adipose tissue quantification from CT Angiography,10165813,R01HL148787,"['Adipose tissue', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Angiography', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Arteries', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Cardiac Death', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical assessments', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Event', 'Future', 'Hospitals', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Language', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Patient risk', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Rupture', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stenosis', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trees', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'acute coronary syndrome', 'arm', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically significant', 'computerized', 'coronary calcium scoring', 'coronary computed tomography angiography', 'coronary event', 'coronary plaque', 'density', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'heart imaging', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'patient registry', 'prognostic significance', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'risk prediction']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,684863
"Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Abstract Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) accounts for 5% of all strokes, has a high mortality and the cost to society is similar to ischemic stroke since subjects are much younger. Though SAH fatality has decreased ~50% in the last 25 years due to immediate repair of aneurysms, improved medical management and nimodipine, nearly 1/3 of SAH patients develop delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) often with cerebral infarction which is associated with poor outcomes. Though this was thought to be due delayed cerebral vasospasm, recent studies have shown that decreasing or preventing vasospasm does not improve outcomes. This has led to alternative hypotheses that combined effects of microvessel thrombosis and vasospasm combined with cortical spreading ischemia and peripheral and central inflammation may cause DCI. Thus, there is a great unmet need to assess potential treatment targets that contribute to DCI following SAH in humans and that could be used to predict DCI to begin early treatment and to predict outcome to better allocate resources. The premise of the proposal is based upon the findings that we have shown that gene expression in blood can predict SAH patients who develop vasospasm. This led us to Hypothesize that clotting and inflammatory molecules in blood interact with the brain microvasculature and other factors to cause Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) and delayed cerebral infarction following SAH which lead to poor outcomes. We propose that gene profiles in blood will predict DCI and predict outcomes using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).  R61 Phase. Specific Aim #1a: Perform RNA sequencing (RNAseq) on whole blood of a training cohort of patients 1, 2 and 3 days after a SAH but prior to DCI compared to matched vascular risk factor controls. Specific Aim #1b. Identify the most significantly regulated genes and pathways in blood at 1, 2 or 3d that distinguish SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days from SAH patients who do not develop DCI. Specific Aim #1c: Use WGCNA to identify key hub genes and upstream genes expressed at 1, 2 or 3d after SAH and which are associated with developing DCI at 4-14d and might be causative. Specific Aim #1d. Use Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning to identify the least number of genes at 1, 2 or 3d from Aim #1b that best predict (1) SAH patients who develop DCI at 4-14 days (2) and predict mRS of 0, 1-3, 4-5, and 6 at 3 months. Specific Aim #1e. Confirm RNAseq with qRT-PCR and assess qRT-PCR accuracy and precision. R33 Phase. Specific Aim #2. In a separate validation cohort of SAH patients perform qRT-PCR on their peripheral blood to measure expression of genes derived in Aim #1 to predict using Support Vector Machine (SVM) on day 1, 2 and/or day 3 which patients will develop DCI at 4-14 days and which patients will have mRS=0 (no deficit), 1-2, 3-5 and mRS=6 (dead) at 3 months.  Contexts of Use. The molecules/pathways that predict DCI and mRS could serve as future treatment or prevention targets of DCI. Predicting who will develop DCI would make it possible to treat DCI earlier. In addition, future clinical trials to prevent DCI following SAH would enroll just those patients predicted to develop DCI after SAH. Predicting mRS outcomes could be used to stratify patients in future DCI trials. Narrative  This proposal will perform RNAseq on blood of a derivation cohort of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients to determine those genes that best predict Delayed Cerebral Ischemia (DCI) between 4 and 14 days and that predict median Rankin Scores (mRS) outcomes at 90 days using cross-correlation. These genes are then measured in an independent validation cohort of SAH patients to predict who develops DCI by 14d, and to predict their mRS at 90 days after SAH. The studies will direct early treatment for DCI, identify treatment targets for DCI, and help stratify patients for future DCI treatment trials.",Biomarker Signatures for Delayed Cerebral Ischemia and Outcome Following Subarachnoid Hemorrhage,10105072,R61NS119345,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aneurysm', 'Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhages', 'Angiography', 'Arteries', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Catheters', 'Cerebral Infarction', 'Cerebral Ischemia', 'Cerebral hemisphere hemorrhage', 'Cerebrovascular Spasm', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Coagulation Process', 'Cognitive', 'Complication', 'Derivation procedure', 'Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Endothelin Receptor Antagonist', 'Enrollment', 'FDA approved', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Hemorrhage', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Ischemia', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial dysfunction', 'Neurologic', 'Nimodipine', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Placebos', 'Prevention', 'Pulmonary Edema', 'Quantitative Reverse Transcriptase PCR', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Resources', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Societies', 'Stroke', 'Subarachnoid Hemorrhage', 'Survivors', 'Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome', 'Thrombosis', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Vasospasm', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'care costs', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'mortality', 'outcome prediction', 'patient stratification', 'peripheral blood', 'prevent', 'repaired', 'spreading depression', 'stroke patient', 'support vector machine', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'treatment trial', 'vascular risk factor', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT DAVIS,R61,2021,681385
"Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse Project Summary/ Abstract Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), defined by >50% collapse of large airways during expiration, resulting from either cartilaginous weakening or redundancy of the posterior membranous wall of the trachea, is an increasingly recognized disorder associated with cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Airflow obstruction in smokers primarily arises from increased resistance to airflow in the small distal conducting airways <2 mm in diameter. It is plausible that in a subset of smokers with and without COPD, central airway collapse results in additional resistance to airflow, resulting in substantial respiratory morbidity. Ninety-two million adults in the Unites States are active or past smokers, and ECAC is present in approximately 5% of current and former smokers. The presence of ECAC is associated with greater dyspnea, worse respiratory-quality of life and greater frequency of exacerbations after adjustment for underlying lung disease. Whether these patients will benefit from interventional therapies such as stenting or tracheopexy depends on whether the airflow resistance caused by ECAC contributes to symptoms, and this in turn depends on the relative contribution of central and small airways to overall airflow resistance. If the overall airflow resistance is primarily due to distal small airways obstruction in a given patient with ECAC, treating central airway collapse is unlikely to benefit such a patient. Our central hypothesis is that ECAC results in additional airflow obstruction beyond that incurred in the small airways, and that in a subset of patients the central airways are the major site of airflow obstruction and hence are amenable to therapy. The complex interplay of proximal and distal airway resistances and transpulmonary pressures does not lend itself to direct measurements in human subjects across a range of physiological pressure and flow changes. We propose a combination of CT-derived imaging and patient-personalized benchtop model and deep learning to answer these questions with the following specific aims. Aim 1 of this application will be to derive personalized patient- specific information on airway geometry and resistance using airway segmentation from computed tomography (CT) scans. We will calculate airway resistances in central and small airways using standard formulae. The goal of Aim 2 is to create bench-top simulations to understand the complex interplay between the resistance of small and large airways. In Aim 3, we will use deep learning to derive probability scores for clinically substantial ECAC from segmented airway images on computed tomography. The results of our study will enable patient-specific personalized therapies for ECAC. The mechanistic insights gained from this study will help identify patients with clinically significant ECAC and hence most likely to benefit from therapeutic interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Expiratory central airway collapse (ECAC), greater than 50% collapse of the large airways during expiration, is present in 5% of chronic smokers, and is associated with substantial respiratory morbidity disproportionate to underlying lung disease. Resistance to airflow in smokers is thought to primarily occur in the small conducting airways. By using benchtop models and deep learning to determine the effect of central airway collapse on overall airway resistance and its contribution to airflow obstruction relative to small airway resistance, the proposed project will identify patients with ECAC who will benefit from intervention, and cause a paradigm shift in the therapy of these patients.",Deep Learning and Fluid Dynamics Based Phenotyping of Expiratory Central Airway Collapse,10149998,R21EB027891,"['3-Dimensional', '3D Print', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Air Movements', 'Airway Resistance', 'Area', 'Body mass index', 'Breathing', 'Caliber', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dyspnea', 'Exhalation', 'Forced expiratory volume function', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Liquid substance', 'Lung diseases', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Probability', 'Pulmonary Emphysema', 'Pulmonary Function Test/Forced Expiratory Volume 1', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Resistance', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Smoking History', 'Spirometry', 'Stents', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Trachea', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Tube', 'United States', 'Visualization', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'airway obstruction', 'base', 'cartilaginous', 'cigarette smoking', 'clinical application', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'expiration', 'former smoker', 'human subject', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'pressure', 'respiratory', 'respiratory morbidity', 'response', 'sex', 'simulation', 'three-dimensional modeling']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R21,2021,185497
"Combining Systems Pharmacology Modeling With Machine Learning To Identify Sub-Populations At Risk Of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes Project Summary  Torsades de Pointes, a lethal ventricular arrhythmia, is a side effect of several commonly used antiarrhythmics, antibiotics, antipsychotics, antihistamines and other ‘non-cardiovascular’ therapies. Though this adverse event is rare, it can lead to ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. The ignorance about the underlying differences between those at high risk versus low risk of forming this drug-induced arrhythmia halts any considerable progress in preventing it. Rather than simply removing these drugs from the market, a closer examination of the physiological and clinical traits of patients who benefited from the treatment and those who formed the arrhythmia needs to be performed. This highlights the idea of precision medicine and the importance of identifying relevant sub-groups of patients likely to benefit from a treatment versus those who are highly susceptible to a drug-induced adverse event. The current standards for predicting risk, a lengthened action potential (AP) duration of cells and a prolonged QT interval on an echocardiogram (ECG) have proven ineffective. Thus, there is a need to extract pertinent information from the cellular and tissue levels before administration of the therapeutic to detect patterns only apparent in the high-risk population. To analyze this concept, I plan to (1) explain at a mechanistic level the differences between the healthy and at-risk patients, (2) identify important AP and ECG signatures that can predict risk early on, and (3) connect the physiological and clinical findings to improve the profile and description of the high-risk population. I will combine two complementary computational techniques: (1) simulations with mechanistic quantitative systems pharmacology models of heart cells and tissues; and (2) advanced machine learning approaches that can identify hidden patterns. Thus, this project aims to develop an algorithm which will improve risk prediction and upgrade the current imperfect and unreliable standards for prescribing proarrhythmic therapies. Project Narrative Current standards for identifying patients at risk of forming the rare but lethal ventricular tachycardia, Drug- induced Torsades de Pointes include measuring the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG). Although this decently predicts susceptibility, there remains a percentage of patients who still succumb to an arrhythmia with a normal QT. To improve patient risk stratification, this research project aims to develop an algorithm that can unmask subtle precursors at both the physiological and clinical levels, classify high risk patients, and upgrade the current imperfect standards for prescribing these therapies.",Combining Systems Pharmacology Modeling With Machine Learning To Identify Sub-Populations At Risk Of Drug-Induced Torsades de Pointes,10082298,F31HL149358,"['Action Potentials', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Antibiotics', 'Antihistamines', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Arrhythmia', 'Biological Factors', 'Cardiac', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Disease', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Exposure to', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Ion Channel', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Muscle Cells', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Predisposition', 'Reporting', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Torsades de Pointes', 'Translating', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Ventricular Fibrillation', 'Ventricular Tachycardia', 'base', 'complex data', 'delayed rectifier potassium channel', 'drug market', 'efficacious treatment', 'experimental study', 'heart cell', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'insight', 'patient subsets', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'responders and non-responders', 'risk prediction', 'risk stratification', 'side effect', 'simulation', 'sudden cardiac death', 'supervised learning', 'trait']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,F31,2021,44436
"Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning PROJECT ABSTRACT Heart transplantation is a life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure, a devastating disease which kills over 250,000 Americans each year. Unfortunately, the supply of deceased donor hearts cannot meet demand, and over a third of candidates will die or be delisted without transplant. In the context of such scarcity, allocation must make the best use of scarce deceased donor hearts by ranking candidates from most to least medically urgent. In contrast to other organ transplant systems, there is currently no objective score used to rank heart transplant candidates on the waitlist. Instead, each candidate’s priority for transplantation is based on “Status,” a designation determined by the supportive therapy prescribed by their transplant center. I have previously shown that some heart transplant centers appear to overtreat candidates with intensive therapies at far higher rates than other centers. My preliminary data demonstrates that these practices have consequences for heart allocation effectiveness. High survival benefit centers reserve intense supportive therapy for candidates who have poor prognoses without transplant, saving lives by prioritizing the sickest patients. In contrast, low survival benefit centers list stable candidates and escalate the use of supportive therapies. Based on these data, there is a clear need for a new system to fairly allocate donor hearts. The overall objective of this K08 application is to develop and simulate a novel Heart Allocation Score (HAS) designed to objectively identify the candidates who gain the greatest survival benefit from heart transplantation. Previous attempts to develop such a score using conventional statistical methods have been inaccurate, but cutting-edge machine learning (ML) techniques outperform conventional regression models in many clinical contexts. In addition, a new open-source Heart Simulated Allocation Model (HSAM) is needed to compare policy alternatives because the available program is closed-source, inflexible, outdated, and structurally unable to simulate allocation scores developed with ML. My overall hypothesis is that a HAS developed with ML will lead to policy that optimizes heart allocation. I will test this hypothesis in three Aims. In Aim 1, I will use the complete national transplant registry dataset (N = 109,315 adult candidates) to predict waitlist survival, comparing ML prediction models to the current therapy-based system. In Aim 2, I will use the same registry to predict post-transplant survival for heart recipients, comparing conventional statistical methods to ML. In Aim 3, I will develop a) a new, open-source HSAM which I will use to b) compare current policy to a novel HAS policy constructed from the best prediction models from Aim 1 & 2. My overall career goal is to save lives by designing delivery systems that fairly and efficiently distribute scarce medical resources. To accomplish this, I plan to earn a PhD in Health Services Research focused on ML, simulation modeling, and health policy. Achieving the goals of this proposal will lead to the foundation of a novel heart allocation system that has the potential to save lives and equip me with the skills needed for future R01- level applications in the field of scarce healthcare resource allocation. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Heart transplantation is a potentially life-saving treatment for end-stage heart failure but unfortunately donors are scarce and only a fortunate minority of patients receive hearts. Current heart allocation policy relies on the intensity of treatment to decide who receives a heart, but this system cannot consistently identify the sickest candidates who stand to benefit the most from heart transplantation. This proposal aims to improve heart allocation by 1) developing a data-driven, objective heart allocation score with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, and 2) building novel, more flexible simulation software.",Mending a Broken Heart Allocation System with Machine Learning,10088470,K08HL150291,"['Adult', 'American', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Effectiveness', 'Ensure', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Health Resources', 'Health Services Research', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Minority', 'Modeling', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Policy Analysis', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Research', 'Resource Allocation', 'Resources', 'Savings', 'Scientist', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Supportive care', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'United States Dept. of Health and Human Services', 'Update', 'Waiting Lists', 'base', 'career', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'health care delivery', 'high risk', 'improved', 'models and simulation', 'mortality risk', 'novel', 'open source', 'organ allocation', 'organ procurement transplantation network', 'post-transplant', 'predictive modeling', 'programs', 'risk stratification', 'simulation', 'simulation software', 'skills', 'tool', 'transplant centers', 'transplant registry']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K08,2021,157896
"Elucidating hereditary transthyretin-mediated heart failure risk using machine learning, polygenic risk and recall by genotype approaches in African ancestry individuals PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Mutations in the Transthyretin (TTR) gene can lead to deposition of abnormal amyloid fibrils in the myocardium, resulting in hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) and leading to heart failure. Targeted therapies for hATTR-CM have recently been developed and have shown to improve mortality and hospitalization.  Recently, we led a study (Journal of American Medical Association, Dec 2019) that showed that the TTR V122I mutation, commonly observed in racial/ethnic minorities (4% in African Americans (AAs) and 1% in Hispanic Americans (HAs)), confers two-fold increased risk of heart failure. Despite this strong effect, only 11% of V122I carriers with heart failure were appropriately diagnosed with hATTR-CM, suggesting marked underdiagnosis and mis-diagnosis of the disease. We further showed subclinical evidence of echocardiographic derangements in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers, suggesting early signs can occur well before onset of disease.  We propose to extend our prior work by addressing knowledge gaps which are necessary for targeted therapies to attain their full potential. These include: understanding the incomplete penetrance of V122I; identifying V122I carriers in large health care systems where genotyping is not common; and understanding subclinical disease burden. In Aim 1, we will examine the interplay between a polygenic risk score, which are comprised of millions of single nucleotide variants with small effects, and V122I, a monogenic mutation with a single strong effect, analyzed in conjunction with clinical risk factors on heart failure in in 6,609 AAs and 9,006 HAs in the BioMe biobank and 5,833 AAs in the Penn Medicine Biobank (PMBB). In Aim 2, we will apply machine learning tools to multi-modal electronic health record (EHR) data to identify V122I carriers in ~8 million patients from an electronic health record (EHR) data repository at Mount Sinai. In Aim 3, we will evaluate subclinical effects of amyloid deposition on cardiac structural/functional traits in young, asymptomatic V122I carriers by recalling V122I carriers for imaging evaluation including research-grade echocardiograms, cardiac magnetic resonance and technetium nuclear scanning.  The proposal is innovative because we are utilizing two large diverse ancestry EHR-linked biobanks from academic health systems (BioMe at Mount Sinai, and PMBB at University of Pennsylvania), along with adopting cutting-edge methods including multi-ethnic polygenic risk scores, and machine learning approaches on multi-modal EHR data. We further propose patient recall based on genotypes and perform deep phenotyping using comprehensive heart imaging scans.  This proposal has the potential to realize the potential of precision medicine for heart failure in racial/ethnic minorities by informing clinical care, population management, risk stratification and clinical trials. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Transthyretin V122I, is a highly penetrant mutation for hereditary transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (hATTR-CM) that is common in African Americans and Hispanic Americans. Recent therapies have been approved to treat hATTR-CM, which have led to decreased mortality; thus, understanding who will develop hATTR-CM, accurate identification of V122I carriers and understanding hidden disease burden is important. In this proposal, we examine the population health impact of V122I using polygenic risk scores, machine learning approaches on electronic health records, and patient recall by genotype, which can lead to new population health strategies for heart failure in racial and ethnic minorities.","Elucidating hereditary transthyretin-mediated heart failure risk using machine learning, polygenic risk and recall by genotype approaches in African ancestry individuals",10101075,R01HL155915,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'African', 'African American', 'Age', 'American Medical Association', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Fibrils', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiomyopathies', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caribbean Hispanic', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diphosphates', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Echocardiography', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Journals', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minority Groups', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardium', 'Nuclear', 'Onset of illness', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Prealbumin', 'Quality of life', 'Recontacts', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supportive care', 'Technetium', 'Technetium 99m', 'Testing', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'clinical risk', 'data repository', 'disease diagnosis', 'ethnic minority population', 'heart imaging', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'polygenic risk score', 'population health', 'precision medicine', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'risk stratification', 'scale up', 'screening', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'trait', 'underserved minority']",NHLBI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,770230
"Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP) Abstract Placental abruption is an obstetrical complication defined as premature placental separation. Despite its elusive etiology, it is believed to be the consequence of acute stimuli – ischemia, inflammation, and oxidative stress at the maternal‐fetal interface – associated with rupture of the decidual artery, resulting in (premature) placental separation. The study of abruption and maternal and newborn long‐term cardiovascular and hemorrhagic/thrombotic cerebrovascular events is the central focus of the proposed project. We will examine the long‐term impact of abruption on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality in women and in their children. We will also investigate the relationship of clinical classification (mild and severe forms) of abruption, risks based on abruption across successive pregnancies, and abruption in twin pregnancies, on rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We will undertake a causal mediation analysis to evaluate the extent to which these associations may be mediated through (i) preterm delivery and (ii) small for gestational age births. We will perform this analysis by clinical classification of abruption and estimate the extent of mediation following corrections for both measured (socio‐demographic characteristics, including maternal smoking, comorbid medical conditions, and obstetrical events), and unmeasured confounding. A unique aspect of this project will be to identify, through applications of Support Vector Machines and Deep Learning algorithms, subsets of women at high risk for abruption and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity. Finally, we will examine whether maternal race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status are effect measure modifiers of the association between abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. We propose to address these aims through a large population‐based epidemiologic study, utilizing data from the Myocardial Infarction Data Acquisition System (MIDAS), a New Jersey statewide database of all patients admitted to all non‐federal acute care hospitals in NJ with a CVD diagnosis, with longitudinal follow‐up of up to 30 years. The MIDAS data will be linked to the NJ fetal death and linked live birth‐ infant death data with associated maternal and newborn hospitalization data between 1980‐2017 to create one of the largest and most comprehensive databases in the US to evaluate the extent to which sentinel events in pregnancy impart lasting risk for women's and children's health later in life. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, policy implications and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH SIGNIFICANCE) The overarching goal of this project is to examine the associations between placental abruption and risks of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality later in life. The project will focus on overall associations, as well as identifying subsets of women at high risk based on abruption severity, recurrent abruptions, gestational age at delivery, and fetal growth restriction. This project will provide unprecedented opportunities to address public health, and policy implications regarding women's health, and clinical screening recommendations of women during the period following delivery regarding risk susceptibility to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.",Cardiovascular Health After Placental Abruption (CHAP),10238171,R01HL150065,"['Abruptio Placentae', 'Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Arteries', 'Attention', 'Birth', 'Cardiovascular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Congestive Heart Failure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Fetal Death', 'Fetal Growth Retardation', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gestational Age', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Goals', 'Health Policy', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Risk Woman', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Inflammation', 'Ischemia', 'Life', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'New Jersey', 'Newborn Infant', 'Outcome', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Patients', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Placenta', 'Pre-Eclampsia', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary Embolism', 'Race', 'Recommendation', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Rupture', 'Sentinel', 'Severities', 'Small for Gestational Age Infant', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'System', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Uterus', 'Vision', 'Woman', 'Women&apos', 's Health', 'acute care', 'base', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular health', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'cerebrovascular', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning algorithm', 'epidemiology study', 'follow-up', 'health of the mother', 'high risk', 'hypertensive heart disease', 'improved', 'infant death', 'insight', 'interest', 'maternal cigarette smoking', 'maternal risk', 'mortality', 'obstetrical complication', 'policy implication', 'population based', 'premature', 'screening guidelines', 'sociodemographics', 'stillbirth', 'support vector machine', 'thrombotic']",NHLBI,RBHS-ROBERT WOOD JOHNSON MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,686450
"Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hospital readmission is an undesirable, costly outcome that may be preventable. Hospitalized patients with diabetes are at higher risk of readmission within 30 days (30-d readmission) than patients without diabetes, and >1 million readmissions occur among diabetes patients in the US annually. Certain interventions can reduce readmission risk, but applying these interventions widely is cost prohibitive. One approach for improving the efficiency of interventions that reduce readmission risk is to target high-risk patients. We previously published a model, the Diabetes Early Readmission Risk Indicator (DERRITM), that predicts the risk of all-cause 30-d readmission of patients with diabetes. The DERRI, however, has modest predictive accuracy (C-statistic 0.63- 0.69), and requires manual data input. Recently, we demonstrated that adding variables to the DERRI substantially improves predictive accuracy (DERRIplus, C-statistic 0.82). However, using this larger model to predict readmission risk based on manual input of data would be too labor intensive for clinical settings. Indeed, most readmission risk prediction models are limited by the trade-off between accuracy and ease of use; lack of translation to a tool that integrates with clinical workflow; modest accuracy; lack of validation; and dependence on data only available after hospital discharge.  The objectives of the current proposal are: 1) To develop more accurate all-cause unplanned 30-d readmission risk prediction models using electronic health record (EHR) data of patients with diabetes (eDERRI); 2) To translate the models to an automated, EHR-based tool that predicts % readmission risk of hospitalized patients; and 3) To prospectively validate the eDERRI models and tool. The new eDERRI models will expand upon the variables in the DERRIplus based on availability in EHR data (e.g., sociodemographics, encounter history, medication use, laboratory results, comorbidities, and length of stay). To develop the models, we will leverage data from the PaTH Clinical Data Research Network (CDRN), a multi-center, 40-plus hospital member of the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet). We will apply state-of-the-art deep-learning methods to develop optimal predictive models. This project will analyze a large, multi-center cohort of nearly 340,000 discharges with cutting-edge techniques to develop better models and translate them to an automated tool that predicts readmission risk for individual patients with diabetes. The proposed tool would identify higher risk patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to develop more accurate models that predict the risk of repeat hospitalizations among patients with diabetes. The models will be programmed into a tool that will be integrated with an electronic health record system and automatically predict the re-hospitalization risk of patients. Such a tool could be used to identify higher risk diabetes patients more likely to benefit from intervention, thus improving care and reducing costs.",Developing and validating EHR-integrated readmission risk prediction models for hospitalized patients with diabetes,10245208,R01DK122073,"['Admission activity', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Paths', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Goals', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Institution', 'Insulin', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Participant', 'Patient Readmission', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'comorbidity Index', 'cost', 'cost outcomes', 'deep learning', 'demographics', 'design', 'diabetes risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'learning strategy', 'member', 'model development', 'patient oriented', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive tools', 'prospective', 'readmission risk', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sociodemographics', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDDK,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R01,2021,562886
"Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway PROJECT SUMMARY Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), characterized by heart failure symptoms with normal ejection fraction, is highly prevalent. However, most HFpEF patients do not respond to standard therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), and there are no clear and uniform diagnostic criteria to stratify and differentiate HFpEF from HFrEF. Therefore, there is a pressing unmet need for us to better understand HFpEF at the molecular and system levels. Unbiased approaches such as machine learning (ML) offer a powerful means to tease out the molecular signatures of HFpEF in relevant disease models. The emerging evidence implicates that metabolism and redox homeostasis are two significant disruptions in cellular processes evidenced by clinical symptoms of HFpEF. Previous studies have identified branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolic defect as another major metabolic hallmark in heart failure as well as in metabolic disorders. Moreover, BCAA catabolic defects have been demonstrated to directly impact mitochondrial function and elevate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, resulting in oxidative stress-sensitive post-translational modifications (O-PTMs) that govern protein function and pathways. These exciting discoveries lead to our new hypothesis that O-PTM-mediated proteome remodeling is a dynamic and pervasive molecular change in diseased hearts, affecting proteins with central function in cardiac homeostasis and pathophysiology. To investigate the unique molecular features and pathogenic mechanisms of HFpEF, we highlight a novel HFpEF mouse model that incorporates both genetic predisposition for obesity/diabetes and pressure-overload, the two major risk factors for HFpEF, by performing trans-aortic constriction (TAC) in the ob/ob mice. We have also perfected the experimental tools and data analysis platform to provide O-PTM profiling at the whole-proteome level in hearts. Accordingly, we have strategically formulated the following aims according to three phenotypic levels: At the systemic level, Aim 1 will establish and characterize in vivo mouse models of HFpEF vs. HFrEF by cardiac and mitochondrial function as well as redox status. At the organellar level, Aim 2 will conduct targeted proteomics profiling of the cardiac mitochondria and extract O-PTM signatures using ML-based methods to achieve deep phenotyping of HFpEF and HFrEF. This information will then be integrated and enriched in an O- PTM molecular atlas and knowledge graph. At the molecular level, Aim 3 will target the BCAA catabolic pathway to exhaustively scrutinize its role in HFpEF and HFrEF. A multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets. PROJECT NARRATIVE HFpEF is highly prevalent, yet there are few effective treatments or clear criteria to differentiate it from HFrEF. We propose to extract molecular signatures unique to HFpEF and HFrEF using a novel HFpEF mouse model and machine learning-based approaches. We anticipate that a multilevel understanding of the HFpEF phenotype, from its global profiling to molecular targets, will provide valuable new insights into the disease process that can lead to potential novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets.",Extraction of molecular signature of HFpEF via a machine learning-empowered proteomic characterization: A study of the BCAA pathway,10183311,R01HL146739,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Biology', 'Branched-Chain Amino Acids', 'Cardiac', 'Catabolism', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Defect', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease model', 'EFRAC', 'Enzymes', 'Exposure to', 'Failure', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Glucose', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Homeostasis', 'Hypertension', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanical Stress', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic stress', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mitochondria', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Molecular Target', 'Mus', 'Myocardium', 'Nature', 'Obese Mice', 'Obesity', 'Organ', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Post-Translational Protein Processing', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Reactive Oxygen Species', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Technology', 'Thinness', 'Treatment Failure', 'Uncertainty', 'Woman', 'antioxidant enzyme', 'base', 'computational platform', 'constriction', 'effective therapy', 'empowered', 'exhaustion', 'fatty acid metabolism', 'heart function', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'knowledge graph', 'men', 'molecular phenotype', 'mouse model', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'preservation', 'pressure', 'protein function', 'therapeutic target', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,649707
"Harnessing Big Data to Identify Effective Peripheral Artery Disease Treatments in Chronic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Peripheral artery disease (PAD), characterized by diseased arteries to the limbs, affects 200 million people worldwide and 9 million people in the U.S. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 20 million people in the U.S. and confers a markedly higher risk for PAD. Yet patients with CKD are less likely to have revascularization procedures and are more likely to undergo lower extremity amputation than patients without CKD. In addition to a high prevalence of traditional risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes mellitus, patients with CKD have other unique risk factors such as chronic inflammation or uremia, which in turn can lead to more aggressive PAD at a younger age. Therefore, patients with CKD need dedicated study. Our overarching goal is to help close these evidence gaps and address these limitations by harnessing the power of Optum Clinformatics Data Mart, which includes over 7 billion claims records on over 83 million unique lives from all 50 states spanning 2005-2019. Our secondary goal is to facilitate future PAD studies using real-world data by leveraging the power of natural language processing to improve our ability to accurately and automatically ascertain PAD from large electronic health record databases. Our innovative algorithm will be of particular importance among subgroups where clinical trial evidence is limited, such as in advanced CKD. Our proposal has the Specific Aims. Aim 1: To evaluate lower extremity revascularization in patients with non-dialysis- requiring CKD. We hypothesize that patients with CKD undergoing surgical versus endovascular revascularization will have longer initial hospitalization, but fewer subsequent major adverse limb events. AIM 2: To evaluate antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications after lower extremity revascularization in patients with non-dialysis-requiring CKD. We hypothesize that real-world patients with CKD treated with antiplatelet medications or direct oral anticoagulants after lower extremity revascularization will have higher rates of bleeding but lower rates of major adverse limb events. AIM 3: To develop an algorithm that accurately and automatically ascertains PAD from electronic health record databases. We hypothesize that a natural language processing-approach applied to diagnostic vascular testing reports will have better test performance (i.e. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values) for identifying PAD than a traditional approach that uses administrative billing codes. Manual chart review will serve as the gold standard. PROJECT NARRATIVE Peripheral artery disease (PAD) affects millions of people around the world, causing decreased mobility, non- healing wounds, gangrene and amputations. Patients with chronic kidney disease have a higher risk for PAD and its complications, but relatively little is known about what treatments are effective in this population. Our project aims to narrow some of these knowledge gaps to improve PAD treatment practices for patients with chronic kidney disease.",Harnessing Big Data to Identify Effective Peripheral Artery Disease Treatments in Chronic Kidney Disease,10180665,R01HL151351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Amputation', 'Anticoagulants', 'Arteries', 'Aspirin', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Big Data', 'Biometry', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Code', 'Data', 'Data Mart', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Future', 'Gangrene', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hemorrhage', 'High Prevalence', 'Home environment', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Inflammation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Limb structure', 'Lower Extremity', 'Manuals', 'Medial', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Modernization', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nephrology', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Oral', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Peripheral arterial disease', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk Factors', 'Safety', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stroke', 'Subgroup', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uremia', 'calcification', 'career', 'cohort', 'cost', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'health related quality of life', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'non-healing wounds', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'programs', 'virtual']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,354432
"Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD Abstract Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is exceptionally common, with an estimated one hundred million afflicted people in the United States. Detection and risk stratification of this very common disease remains a major challenge. Despite recent advances, including development of numerous therapeutic agents presently in phase 2 and 3 trials, NAFLD remains a silent disease in which the vast majority of patients accumulate progressive liver damage without signs or symptoms and, undiagnosed, receive no medical care. The NAFLD patients at highest risk of cirrhosis are those with moderate or greater liver fibrosis at the time of diagnosis, a group of patients who are described as having high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH). The current reference standard for identifying people with hrNASH is liver biopsy, which is expensive, invasive, and limited by interobserver variability. The focus of this project is to develop and validate low cost non-invasive diagnostic technology to diagnose hrNASH. We propose to accomplish this in three Specific Aims. First, we will expand and annotate an existing database of patients with chronic liver disease from 328 subjects to 1,000 subjects, ~40% of whom will have NAFLD. The database will contain ~20,000 images (~10,000 ultrasound elastography images and ~ 10,000 conventional ultrasound images) and multiple demographic and clinical data points for each subject (a total of ~30,000 clinical, laboratory, and demographic data points). We have previously developed advanced image processing techniques to make ultrasound elastography more accurate and less variable. We will use this large database to develop, customize and refine our image processing techniques for NAFLD evaluation (Aim 1), with the goal of improving ultrasound elastography diagnosis of hrNASH. Second, we will combine conventional ultrasound elastography imaging, conventional ultrasound imaging, our advanced image analysis techniques, and the demographic, clinical, and laboratory data in a machine learning model to predict hrNASH and will compare the performance of our predictive model with the FIB4, a widely-used blood test-based prediction rule (Aim 2). Third, we will validate our predictive model in an independent prospective cohort of NAFLD subjects undergoing biopsy for NAFLD risk stratification (Aim 3). We hypothesize that the combination of image processing-enhanced elastography and conventional ultrasound imagery combined with demographic, clinical, and laboratory data will have greater predictive power for hrNASH than clinical or sonographic data alone. The proposed predictive models have the potential to (1) reduce the number of liver biopsies performed for hrNASH detection, (2) facilitate recruitment for clinical trials of NAFLD therapeutics, and (3) improve care quality for the most common liver disease in the United States. Project Narrative In this project, we aim to create low-cost non-invasive technology to diagnose people with high risk non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (hrNASH), a common liver disease that has a high risk of cirrhosis. We will accomplish this goal by improving liver ultrasound imaging and by creating a prediction tool that integrates liver ultrasound, laboratory testing and clinical information. This prediction tool has the potential to reduce the need for liver biopsies.","Development of a Machine Learning Model to Integrate Clinical, Laboratory, Sonographic, and Elastographic Data for Noninvasive Liver Tissue Characterization in NAFLD",10075930,R01DK119860,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Tests', 'Caring', 'Cirrhosis', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Laboratories', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase II/III Trial', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Prospective cohort', 'Quality of Care', 'ROC Curve', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Schedule', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Agents', 'Therapeutic Clinical Trial', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'chronic liver disease', 'clinical care', 'cost', 'diagnostic technologies', 'disorder subtype', 'elastography', 'hepatocellular injury', 'high risk', 'image processing', 'improved', 'liver biopsy', 'liver imaging', 'liver injury', 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease', 'nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'standard of care', 'tool']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,448421
"Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern PI: Valentina Kutyifa, MD, PhD University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY Morbidity, mortality, and health care costs of the treatment of systolic heart failure (HF) are rapidly increasing. Cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) is cost-effectively reducing HF events and death in HF patients with a wide QRS and low ejection fraction. However, response to CRT-D is not unequivocally present in all patients, with less benefit in those without the presence of an ECG abnormality, left bundle branch block (non-LBBB), posing a significant treatment challenge. Because of the conflicting and limited data on response to CRT-D in this cohort, it is possible that we currently treat a large proportion of HF patients with non-LBBB who have limited or no benefit from the device. Therefore, better selection of patients for this expensive therapy is warranted. One of our recent studies suggested a clinical benefit in patients with non-LBBB and marked echocardiography response, and identified predictors. However, there is a need to prospectively validate these predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D in non-LBBB in this hard-to-treat patient population, and identify potential novel ECG and echocardiography predictors, utilizing novel statistical methods of machine learning. We propose a prospective, observational, single-arm study in a currently guideline-indicated cohort to validate and identify predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D, including novel ECG and echocardiography markers, and to assess subsequent clinical outcomes in 270 HF patients with an implanted CRT-D and non-LBBB ECG pattern. The primary aim of the study is to prospectively validating our previously identified clinical predictors of echocardiography response to CRT-D in HF patients with non-LBBB that could enable better patient selection. Our secondary aim is to identify the incremental value of novel ECG and echocardiography variables to predict echocardiography response to CRT-D in non-LBBB patients, including ECG variables of sum absolute QRST integral and ventricular electrical activation delay, and echocardiography-derived variables of left ventricular dyssynchrony and contractility. Then we will apply the developed predictive model to prospectively identify non- LBBB patients with CRT-D at a risk of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or death. Tertiary aim is to identify novel ECG and echocardiography predictors of response in non-LBBB using machine learning analysis. Study population will include 270 HF patients with non-LBBB (135 with mild HF and 135 with advanced HF) and an implanted CRT-D with 6 months echocardiography follow-up analyzed by an echocardiography core lab, and assessing clinical outcomes of heart failure, ventricular arrhythmias, or death. Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern Cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D) in heart failure (HF) patients without left bundle branch block (non-LBBB) has been less beneficial to improve outcomes despite being a guideline indicated therapy, posing a significant treatment challenge. However, non-LBBB patients with echocardiography response to CRT-D have better outcomes, and pre-implant variables could predict response, identifying patients who benefit the most. In this study, we plan to enroll 270 HF patients with non-LBBB and guideline- indicated CRT-D implantation to validate our prior echocardiography predictor score, and to identify novel ECG and echocardiography predictors using conventional statistics and machine learning analysis. We will also assess the applicability of such a score for clinical outcomes of HF, ventricular arrhythmias, or death.",Factors Associated with Response to Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy in Heart Failure Patients with Non-LBBB ECG Pattern,10207993,R01HL153390,"['Attenuated', 'Biological', 'Bundle-Branch Block', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Congresses', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defibrillators', 'Devices', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'EFRAC', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Guidelines', 'Health Care Costs', 'Heart', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Implant', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mosses', 'New York', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Predictive Factor', 'Predictive Value', 'Prospective cohort', 'Risk', 'Statistical Methods', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Systolic heart failure', 'Testing', 'Treatment Cost', 'Universities', 'Ventricular', 'Ventricular Arrhythmia', 'Ventricular End-Systolic Volumes', 'arm', 'base', 'cardiac implant', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'cost', 'follow-up', 'implantation', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'kidney dysfunction', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'prospective', 'response', 'statistics', 'study population']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF ROCHESTER,R01,2021,734112
"Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect. Heart Rhythm and Functional Status in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation: miAfib Project Project Summary/Abstract Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent, major arrhythmia in the United States. It leads to an increased risk of stroke, congestive heart failure, and overall mortality. AF is also characterized by symptoms in a majority of patients that can result in significant decreases in health related quality of life and functional status, which are strong predictors of all-cause and cardiovascular hospitalizations in patients with AF. Therefore, improvement in symptoms is an important therapeutic goal in the management of patients with AF along with reducing the risk of stroke and mortality. However, previous studies evaluating symptoms in AF have been limited by their retrospective assessment of symptoms that limits our ability to assess the relationship between heart rhythm, symptoms, affect and functional status in real time. To address all of these gaps, we propose an innovative study that will intensively examine 100 patients with paroxysmal AF using a continuous heart rhythm recorder and a novel mobile application to collect data on symptom and affect ratings during multiple occasions across a day for three weeks. We will then be able to examine the relationship between symptoms, affect, heart rhythm as well as additional features within the ECG recording and assess their effect on functional status in patients with AF. We hypothesize that 1) some symptoms will be much more specifically indicative of being in AF (e.g. palpitations) than others (e.g. fatigue) 2) ECG features derived from signal processing and machine learning algorithms (especially those that serve as surrogates for autonomic function) will be more sensitive and specific for determining the presence and severity of symptoms compared to average heart rate 3) there will be a strong relationship between affect, and both symptoms and functional status . The overarching goal of this proposal is for candidate (Hamid Ghanbari, MD, MPH) to develop an independent research program examining symptoms and associated decline in functional status in patients with paroxysmal AF. The candidate will build upon his previous training by partnering with a team of mentors who are experts in ecological momentary assessment methodology, signal processing and machine learning, affect, and functional status to acquire expertise in evaluation of repeated, real-time assessments of symptoms and to explore novel ECG features that predict symptoms beyond the presence or absence of AF. In concert with the proposed study, the candidate will also pursue didactic training and one-on-one mentoring related to his research aims. This proposal will more clearly characterize symptoms and their physiological and psychological correlates and their subsequent influence on functional status in patients with AF. The insights obtained through this proposal could eventually lead to individualized behavioral and medical interventions that best address these symptoms and associated dysfunction. Project Narrative - Public Health Relevance Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent arrhythmia in the United States and is associated with an increase in the risk of stroke, congestive heart failure and overall mortality. Despite the importance of AF, our understanding of symptoms associated with AF is limited by studies that rely on evaluation of symptoms based on a single clinical visit. The overarching goal of this proposal is to explore the complex relationship between symptoms, heart rhythm, and affect and assess their influence on day-to-day functioning using wearable sensors and a smartphone based mobile application.","Novel Techniques for Evaluating and Assessing Symptoms, Affect.

"Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD), is a leading cause of permanent blindness worldwide. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for diagnosing PACD despite its limited ability to quantify disease severity, especially in patients with early angle closure. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) is a quantitative and objective imaging-based method for assessing the angle. However, there are limited methods for clinicians to apply AS-OCT to the care of angle closure patients. The primary objectives of this K23 career development proposal are: 1) to demonstrate the benefit of a quantitative anterior segment OCT-based approach to evaluating patients with PACD and develop classification models for PACD based on AS-OCT measurements; and 2) to provide an academic glaucoma specialist with the training and mentored research experience necessary to conduct independent clinical research. Achieving these objectives will provide critical skills and experiences necessary to establish an independent research program focused on applying AS-OCT imaging to improve the clinical care of patients with PACD. The proposed K23 application will provide additional training in four vital areas: 1) epidemiology and mechanisms of chronic disease; 2) classification of disease and prediction of disease risk; 3) biostatistical methods for clinical research; 4) machine learning and automated data analysis. The proposed research will use population-based data collected as part of the NIH-funded Chinese American Eye Study (CHES) to compare AS-OCT and gonioscopic assessments of angle width and determine the strength of association between these assessments and known PACD risk factors. The relationship between the degree of angle closure, measured by AS-OCT, and intraocular pressure (IOP), a sequela of angle closure and strong risk factor for glaucoma, will be characterized with CHES data and validated with data obtained by using a novel pupil control system on PACD patients recruited from the USC Roski Eye Institute (USCREI). Classification models for PACD stage and severity based on AS-OCT data from CHES will be developed using machine learning algorithms and validated with prospective data from USCREI patients with PACD. The results of the proposed research will provide the foundation for a future longitudinal study examining the benefit of using anterior segment OCT-based assessments and classification models to evaluate PACD patients and deliver targeted treatment to patients with higher risk for PACG. The ultimate goal of my research is to develop quantitative imaging-based diagnostic and treatment protocols that guide the standardized care of PACD patients and decrease the incidence of PACG and its associated ocular morbidity. PROJECT NARRATIVE The management of angle closure patients at risk for primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG), the most severe form of primary angle closure disease (PACD) and a leading cause of permanent vision loss worldwide, poses a significant challenge for eye care providers. Gonioscopy, a qualitative and subjective angle assessment method, is the current clinical standard for evaluating angle closure patients despite its limited ability to quantify PACD severity and predict progression to PACG. This project seeks to demonstrate the benefit of anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT), a quantitative and objective angle assessment method, and develop anterior segment OCT-based methods for the clinical evaluation of patients with PACD.",Development and Validation of Quantitative Anterior Segment OCT-based Methods to Evaluate Patients with Primary Angle Closure Disease,10085241,K23EY029763,"['Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Aqueous Humor', 'Area', 'Biostatistical Methods', 'Blindness', 'Caring', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Chinese American', 'Chronic Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Epidemiology', 'Eye', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Glaucoma', 'Goals', 'Gonioscopy', 'Healthcare Systems', 'High Prevalence', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Lasers', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Peripheral', 'Physiologic Intraocular Pressure', 'Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma', 'Primary Health Care', 'Pupil', 'Recording of previous events', 'Refractive Errors', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Specialist', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Trabecular meshwork structure', 'Training', 'Treatment Protocols', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Width', 'base', 'care providers', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'disease classification', 'disorder risk', 'experience', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'novel', 'population based', 'programs', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'research clinical testing', 'skills', 'standardized care', 'targeted treatment']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,K23,2021,228758
"The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Project Summary  Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major arrhythmia worldwide, causing palpitations, stroke and mortality, and affecting 2-5 million Americans. Unfortunately, therapy to eliminate AF has had limited success. In our last funding cycle, we focused on localized drivers as potential AF mechanisms. Mapping of drivers has now been validated by concurrent optical mapping of human AF, and their features and have been validated by several other methods in patients. Nevertheless, ablation results for these and other proposed mechanisms for AF outside the pulmonary veins are mixed. It is unclear if this reflects difficulties of AF mapping, or different mechanisms between patients.  The project will develop a novel mechanistic framework for AF that simplifies existing indices by building on scientific consensus that organized AF is easier to treat, and disorganized AF has worse prognosis. This concept spans many existing indices and may help to reconcile them. We have 3 specific aims: (1) To define if the impact of ablation depends on the extent of organizing surrounding the ablation site; (2) To establish candidate mechanisms for organized and disorganized AF zones in individual patients with specific profiles, using machine learning applied to known cases with and without ablation success in our large registry. This comprises detailed AF maps during ablation and after Maze surgery, clinical data and outcomes. (3) To use novel clinical tools to predict whether patients will respond to PVI, other ablation or Maze surgery based on whether targeted regions control larger atrial areas and their locations.  This study will deliver immediate translational and clinical impact, and directly enable personalized medicine for AF ablation. We use detailed clinical mapping in patients, signal processing and computer modeling to develop a novel mechanistic framework and widely applicable clinical tools. We will use tools including machine learning and statistics to classify mechanisms based upon outcomes from ablation in individual patients. We will make our data and code available online. Our team is experienced in electrophysiology, computer science, machine learning, biological physics and statistics. The proposal is thus highly feasible. The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation Narrative Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an enormous public health problem in the United States, affecting 2-5 million Americans and causing rapid heart beats, stroke, heart failure or death. In this project, the applicant will develop a novel framework to better understand human AF that builds on agreement between several concepts for the disease. The applicant will develop strategies to identify AF patients who will best respond to each of several therapies, to guide personalized therapy.",The Dynamics of Human Atrial Fibrillation,10220109,R01HL083359,"['Ablation', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Body Surface', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Computer Models', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Disease', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Atrium', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Observational Study', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Palpitations', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physics', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Procedures', 'Public Health', 'Pulmonary veins', 'Registries', 'Right atrial structure', 'Rotation', 'Schools', 'Site', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Stroke', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'demographics', 'digital', 'experience', 'genomic data', 'hands-on learning', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'insight', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutic intervention', 'outcome forecast', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'success', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,731282
"Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture Over 300,000 hip fractures occur each year in the U.S. and up to 25% of hip-fracture patients die within a year of their injury. Despite the importance of this clinical problem, the diagnostic screening rate for osteoporosis is only 5% of the eligible population, and the sensitivity of measuring bone mineral density (BMD) by DXA, the clinical standard test for diagnosis, is only 50%. Therefore, most patients are not being screened diagnostically for osteoporosis, and for those who are, about half who will experience a hip fracture are missed. Given that the current empirical approach is inadequate, we propose to pursue a more mechanistic approach, combining state-of-the-art biomechanics and machine learning approaches. Biomechanically, the three etiological elements of hip fracture are fall risk, femoral strength, and femoral impact force. In this project, our overall goal is to provide a deeper understanding of how all three biomechanical etiological elements interact in the event of a hip fracture and from that, directly improve clinical fracture risk assessment through the use of a single predictive “Integral Biomechanical Risk (IBR)” parameter. In addition, we will also address the problem of low DXA screening rates by further developing our Biomechanical Computed Tomography (BCT) technology. This test estimates the breaking strength of the femur using finite element analysis of routine clinical CT scans previously acquired for any medical reason, and represents an improvement compared to the use of BMD alone. Since millions of patients are scanned with CT each year, this approach could double screening rates if offered as an alternative to DXA. The proposed study will investigate this biomechanical approach in a large incident hip fracture, case-cohort study (3,000 patients with hip fracture, 6,000 without). This retrospective study will include patients seen at Kaiser Permanente who had an abdominal CT scan as part of medical care prior to any hip fracture; and have standard geriatric measurements in their electronic medical records, which we will use to estimate fall risk. Specifically, our aims are to: 1) utilize electronic medical record data and CT scans to obtain patient-specific measurements related to fall risk, femoral strength, and fall severity, and 2) combine the different elements of hip fracture etiology into the IBR parameter to test the hypothesis that this metric predicts hip fracture independent of age, sex, BMI, race/ethnicity, and history of prior fracture and improves hip fracture prediction compared to the clinical standard (BMD with FRAX). Scientifically, a major novelty of this work is its use of contemporary machine learning algorithms to inform construction of a mechanistic model of the three etiological elements of hip fracture, which should better capture any interactions between these elements compared to a purely statistical-regression approach. In addition, the study cohort will be the largest and most diverse CT-based hip fracture cohort ever assembled. Importantly, positive results from this project would provide a compelling “second front” to DXA that could be quickly translated to widespread clinical practice, profoundly impacting osteoporosis care. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE More than half of individuals who experience hip fracture do not have osteoporosis as assessed by DXA. This project draws together the latest technological advances in CT-based finite element modeling and combines it into a probabilistic model of fracture risk that uses as inputs, data typically available in medical records. By going beyond BMD, the fracture risk prediction tool developed by this work aims to significantly improve clinical fracture risk assessment and substantially impact the preventative care and treatment of osteoporosis.",Clinical Biomechanics of Hip Fracture,10144396,R01AR074958,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Biomechanics', 'Blinded', 'Body mass index', 'Bone Density', 'Calibration', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical assessments', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Discrimination', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Economics', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Femur', 'Finite Element Analysis', 'Fracture', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hip Fractures', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intramuscular', 'Investigation', 'Logistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Modeling', 'Muscle', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Preventive care', 'Preventive treatment', 'Probability', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regression Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Statistical Models', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'abdominal CT', 'base', 'biomechanical model', 'bone', 'bone strength', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'diagnostic screening', 'ductile', 'electronic data', 'experience', 'fall risk', 'falls', 'fracture risk', 'high risk', 'hip bone', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'kinematics', 'machine learning algorithm', 'neuromuscular', 'older patient', 'patient health information', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'sex', 'soft tissue', 'standing height', 'theories', 'tool']",NIAMS,"O.

"A Model for Predicting 2-Year Risk of Incident Late Age-related Macular Degeneration PROJECT SUMMARY Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in the dry or wet form, is the leading cause of vision loss in the developed countries. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) showed that specific antioxidant vitamin supplementation reduces the risk of progression from intermediate stages to late AMD and maintains visual acuity in approximately 25% of patients. While treatment of wet AMD with Intraocular injections can be effective in maintaining vision, such treatments are costly and may be associated with significant cardiovascular risks, or even progression of dry AMD. Hence, it is critical to identify patients at the earlier stages. Unfortunately, there is no effective, automated screening tool to accomplish this, and the patients themselves may be asymptomatic. The goal of this SBIR Direct-to-Phase II proposal is to provide such tool. We have demonstrated the feasibility of AMD screening software ‘iPredictTM’ by successfully identifying 98.1% of individuals with early or intermediate stage AMD. iPredictTM also successfully predicted which individuals would develop late AMD within one year with 87.8% accuracy and two years with 88.4% accuracy. iPredictTM has prototype components for image analysis and machine learning. We also developed a HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform which will enable iPredictTM to perform large-scale screening from remote and rural areas. In order to bring the product to market, these components need to be integrated and tested which is the aim of our proposed Direct-to-Phase II proposal. We aim to develop the finished product which will be ready for the market. We also aim to evaluate the efficacy of iPredictTM in a clinical setup. The AMD preventative market is estimated around $5.4 billion in the U.S. alone. iPredictTM will capture the major market share with its best accuracy and be the first prediction tool for AMD. We aim to commercialize iPredictTM for the screening and prevention of AMD, saving millions of citizens from blindness and reduced quality of life. With iPredictTM’s improvements in speed of delivery, cost of care, and ease of access, the product will be a significant addition to the healthcare system. The iPredictTM’s telemedicine platform will allow large-scale screening from remote/rural areas, primary care clinics, optometry offices and ophthalmology clinics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in its late forms, “dry” or “wet”, is the leading cause of blindness in developed countries. Early intervention and therapy can significantly reduce the progression of early to late AMD. Hence, the identification of patients with early AMD and referral to an ophthalmologist is critically needed to help prevent vision loss.

"Early Mobilization: Operationalizing Big Data & Implementation Science to Lead Expansion to ICUs (E-MOBILE-ICU) PROJECT SUMMARY Almost 800,000 critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation every year and three quarters of the survivors suffer from persistent disability, which poses a major public health problem as critical care becomes more widely utilized and available. Although early mobilization, which engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation, is a promising evidence-based intervention that may prevent disability, less than ten percent of pa- tients ever get out of bed. This proposal aims to apply precision medicine to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from early mobilization and elucidate how it can be implemented successfully to extend the benefits of early mobilization to critical care survivors at greatest risk for long-term disability. I hypothesize that this re- source-intensive intervention can be applied with greater precision to a subset of patients most likely to bene- fit, and that implementation science strategies can be devised to successfully drive adoption of this interven- tion beyond a clinical trial setting. I will test my hypothesis in three aims: Aim 1) I will identify the optimal critical illness phenotype for implementation of early mobilization by using cutting-edge machine learning methods; Aim 2) I will determine the effect of early mobilization on long-term functional disability to incentivize adoption of this practice; Aim 3) I will determine the barriers and facilitators of implementation of early mobilization across five institutions to identify the contextual features associated with successful implementation to inform strategies that can bridge the gap between evidence base and clinical practice. My long-term goal is to mitigate the com- plications of critical illness with clinical trials using precision-based methods to identify at-risk and yet apt-to- benefit populations paired with implementation science methodologies to illuminate how to bring these interven- tions to the bedside. To accomplish this, I have assembled an exceptional interdisciplinary team of mentors (Drs. Vineet Arora, Matthew Churpek, and John Kress) and advisors (Drs. Shyam Prabhakaran, Donald Hedeker, Laura Damschroder, and Matthias Eikermann) who have a track record of NIH-funding and successful mentor- ship of post-doctoral candidates. I intend to build on my foundation as an accomplished clinical trialist and have formulated an in-depth career development plan to gain expertise in machine learning methods to identify differ- ential treatment effects (Churpek and Prabhakaran), longitudinal data analysis, (Arora and Hedeker), and imple- mentation science methods (Arora, Prabhakaran, and Damschroder) to craft strategies that bring complex mul- tidisciplinary interventions from clinical trials (Kress and Eikermann) to everyday ICU care. Completion of this proposal will train me to fill an unmet need defined by a recent National Academy of Medicine publication which indicated that identification of differential treatment effects must be paired with rigorous implementation to help transition evidence base to routine clinical care. Equipped with advanced statistical skills and implementation science approaches, I will be able to design hybrid effectiveness-implementation trials to target and implement complex multidisciplinary interventions to vulnerable populations in future R01 level applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Three-quarters of survivors of mechanical ventilation will develop persistent disability. Early mobilization engages patients in physical activity during mechanical ventilation to prevent disability, but has poor adoption into clinical practice.

"Generalizable prediction of medication adherence in heart failure Project Summary/Abstract Heart failure (HF) is associated with high rates of hospitalization and mortality. While a number of evidence- based therapies have been shown to improve outcomes for patients with HF, nearly half of these patients are not regularly taking their medications. Although medication adherence can be improved through timely interventions, it is challenging for clinicians to accurately identify and predict medication non-adherence at the point of care. The challenge persists partly because medication adherence is a complex process influenced by an interplay of a multitude of patient-, provider-, system-, community-, and therapy-related factors. This gap in identifying patients at risk of non-adherence can be addressed through increasing availability of relevant data from electronic health records (EHRs), which affords the potential to make accurate, real time predictions of adherence in HF. In particular, recent linkages of EHR and pharmacy data has created opportunity for incorporation of prior medication fills into EHR-based adherence prediction models that are updated continuously. Using machine learning (ML) techniques with such data allows for incorporation of a large number of intercorrelated risk factors and their interactions into models and for accommodating continuous updates as new information becomes available. Our objective is to build a ML-based algorithm to predict adherence among patients with HF. The specific aims are: 1) to develop supervised ML algorithms to predict medication adherence among HF patients, using EHR clinical data, linked pharmacy fill data, and location- based social determinants data from a large, urban health system that cares for a diverse patient population; 2) to assess fairness of the developed algorithms by evaluating cross-validated prediction and calibration on patient subgroups based on social and economic factors, to ensure that the desirable prediction performance is maintained for the diverse groups; and 3) to assess generalizability of the algorithms through validation in a second large, urban health system caring for a diverse population. Our approach is innovative and novel in several ways. First, we will take advantage of linkages between pharmacy fill information and the EHR to incorporate pharmacy data in our models. Second, we utilize geocoding of patient addresses combined with publicly available data to incorporate neighborhood-level social determinants of health, which are among the most important predictors of adherence, into our models. Third, we will assess fairness of the model by evaluating the predictive performance and calibration on patients from diverse backgrounds. Fourth, we will ensure generalizability of the prediction algorithm by developing it in one diverse health system and validating the algorithm in a second diverse health system. These models will be developed such that they can be used for point-of-care adherence prediction. Our long term goal is to be able to implement them into the EHR, at which point they can be incorporated into interventions to address medication adherence and, ultimately, improve both adherence and clinical outcomes for patients with HF. Project Narrative Poor medication adherence in heart failure can lead to poor health, but many clinicians are unable to determine who would benefit from interventions to address adherence. We will build machine learning models to identify patients at risk of not taking their medicines using an approach that minimizes potential biases. Electronic health record data will be used in these models, allowing them to be incorporated into interventions to improve medication adherence and reduce the disease burden of heart failure.",Generalizable prediction of medication adherence in heart failure,10095553,R01HL155149,"['Address', 'Adherence', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Calibration', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Development', 'Economic Factors', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ensure', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health system', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heart failure', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Neighborhoods', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Provider', 'Race', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Update', 'Urban Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinical care', 'contextual factors', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'flexibility', 'health data', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'medication compliance', 'medication nonadherence', 'mortality', 'novel', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'point of care', 'population based', 'prediction algorithm', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'social determinants', 'social factors', 'social health determinants', 'socioeconomics', 'supervised learning', 'tool']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,690075
"Integrate Dynamic System Model and Machine Learning for Calibration-Free Noninvasive ICP Project Summary  No clinical device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (nICP) assessment. Past attempts have focused on identifying ICP-related signals that are noninvasively measureable, but have done little to address the calibration problem. Without calibration, only ICP trending can be inferred at the best. However, noninvasive calibration is not trivial. A universal calibration will fail because individual patients require different calibration to obtain accurate results. On the other hand, the use of plain regression for individualized calibration is infeasible because ICP cannot be obtained noninvasively for a de novo patient to begin with.  Invasive ICP monitoring remains a standard of care and this can be leveraged to continuously grow a database of ICP, noninvasive signals, and different calibration equations, e.g., each built from a pair of invasive ICP and noninvasive signal in the database. Then nICP becomes feasible by selecting from a rich set of calibration equations the optimal choice for a de novo patient. In this project, we will pursue three aims that will lead to the development of an accurate noninvasive ICP system based on Transcranial Doppler. These aims are: 1) To implement and validate core algorithms needed for achieving accurate nICP; 2) To test if estimated nICP is sensitive to variations in ultrasound probe placement; 3) To test the generalizability of the proposed nICP approach.  Large epidemiologic surveys reveal that ICP is monitored in only about 58% of US patients when ICP monitoring is indicated. It is a smaller percentage (37%) in European patients and even fewer in developing countries. The proposed nICP approach does not have the high risks associated with invasive ICP, requires no onsite neurosurgical expertise, and can be economically deployed and readily practiced. Therefore, its potential impact is enormous. Project Narrative  No clinically accepted device exists for noninvasive intracranial pressure (ICP) assessment.

"Maternal Antecedents and Electronic Fetal Monitoring in Term Asphyxia (MAESTRA) Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a neurologic syndrome that results from reduced flow of oxygenated blood to the fetal or newborn brain. HIE occurs in 1-3 per 1,000 term births and may cause death or neurologic disabilities such as cerebral palsy. Electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) was developed in the 1970's to assess the adequacy of fetal oxygenation as a strategy to prevent HIE, and is now standard of care. Yet clinical trials report that EFM usage has not reduced the rate of CP, perinatal death or HIE, but is associated with a dramatic increase in cesarean deliveries. The currently used 3 Category fetal heart rate (FHR) classification system, based on simple rules designed to be easy to apply at the bedside, has some utility in predicting HIE. However, Category II FHR patterns that make up the vast majority of tracings are poorly predictive of HIE and confer “indeterminate” risk. Category III patterns are also of limited use in predicting HIE due to low sensitivity. There is an urgent need to develop better objective methods to assess EFM that would identify more fetuses at risk of HIE in time for corrective actions. Uterine tachysystole, or excessive frequency of uterine contractions, has been implicated as a preventable cause of HIE; yet studies report conflicting results. EFM research has been limited by an inability to access and manually analyze the large datasets needed to study HIE. We now have the ability to analyze digital EFM signals using automated methods to measure standard FHR patterns as well as to discover novel aspects of the tracing that may not be readily detectable by a clinician at the bedside. We hypothesize that modern signal processing and machine learning techniques can create highly predictive models of HIE by analyzing established and novel features of EFM tracings, in combination with demographic and pertinent clinical information from the mother and fetus. We propose a population-based retrospective cohort study of 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation at Kaiser Permanente Northern California in 2010-19. Our specific aims are: 1) To create the MAESTRA Cohort dataset that links EFM recordings to HIE and neonatal acidosis among 350,000 infants born at ≥ 36 weeks gestation in 2010-19 at Kaiser Permanente Northern CA; 2) Using modern signal processing and machine learning techniques, to extract established and novel FHR and uterine contractility features from the EFM recordings, and to determine which of these features are most predictive of HIE and acidosis when combined with maternal and fetal clinical data; and 3) To perform external validation by applying the final predictive models to a historical dataset. We anticipate that machine learning techniques incorporating novel FHR and uterine contractility patterns over time, as well as pre- and perinatal clinical characteristics, will improve the predictive value of the EFM data that are already being collected as part of routine care. Our results will inform future clinical trials. Such an unprecedented large-scale multidisciplinary study will lead to improvements in our ability to use EFM data to prevent neonatal brain injury while minimizing unnecessary cesarean sections. MAESTRA Project Narrative Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs when a baby gets reduced oxygen and blood flow to the brain, and can lead to death or long-term disabilities such as cerebral palsy. During labor and delivery, doctors are able to continuously record the heart rate of the fetus. This study will determine how best to use the heart rate information so that we can reduce the number of infants who develop this severe brain condition.",Maternal Antecedents and Electronic Fetal Monitoring in Term Asphyxia (MAESTRA),10145055,R01HD099216,"['Acidosis', 'Address', 'Apgar Score', 'Asphyxia', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'California', 'Categories', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cesarean section', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Educational workshop', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Monitoring', 'Fetus', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Heart Rate', 'Infant', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Metabolic Brain Diseases', 'Metabolic acidosis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Brain Injury', 'Neurologic', 'Newborn Infant', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Pattern', 'Perinatal', 'Perinatal anoxic ischemic brain injury', 'Perinatal mortality demographics', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predictive Value', 'Pregnancy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Retrospective cohort study', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Uterine Contraction', 'Uterus', 'Validation', 'base', 'cohort', 'computerized', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'falls', 'fetal', 'fetus at risk', 'high risk', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'multidisciplinary', 'neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury', 'novel', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'routine care', 'signal processing', 'standard measure', 'standard of care', 'uterine contractility']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,566881
"A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease We propose to develop, optimize, and conduct first in-human measurements of our Magnetic Flexible Endoscope (MFE) robotic platform that may provide a safer and more intelligent alternative to standard colonoscopy (CLS) for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Patients with IBD are at increased risk for colorectal cancer and therefore surveillance has been recommended to occur at intervals less than that recommended for the general population. Thus, over the course of their lifetime, they are subjected to more frequent CLS than their non-lBD counterparts, resulting in a more than 6-fold increase in adverse events. The main risks of CLS are related to procedural sedation, patient discomfort, or perforation of the colon from looping. Looping and mesenteric stretching occur due to the design of the colonoscope. Special maneuvers can be performed to minimize looping, making CLS a procedure that requires a great degree of technical skill and experience to perform safely. By using the proposed robotic platform, the endoscopist will be able to control the motion of the MFE to perform navigation, diagnosis, and therapy (i.e. biopsy, polyp removal/retrieval, injection) inside the human colon. MFE motion is achieved by magnetic coupling between an external permanent magnet (attached to a robotic arm outside the patient's body) and an internal permanent magnet (located inside the proximal head of the MFE). A small-diameter flexible tether between the head of the endoscope and the distal control module (outside the patient's body) allows for passage of commercially available therapeutic tools, insufflation, irrigation, suction/aspiration, and electrical wiring. Employing magnetic attraction at the head of the endoscope, for advancement and manipulation, permits the tether to follow passively-reducing the risk of mesenteric stretching or looping when compared to the traditional colonoscope. We will leverage our experience and extensive preliminary results to test the hypotheses that (1) intelligent robotic control and assistive autonomy in endoscopic tasks improves endoscopic performance, (2) quantifying the portion of colon lumen visualized provides valuable feedback to improve MFE operation and diagnostic yield, and (3) that the MFE is safe and successfully functions in the human colon in a manner similar to conventional CLS. The investigative team, combining engineering and clinical faculty, is uniquely positioned to achieve success of this study-collectively possessing expertise in endoscopic device design, clinical CLS, assessment and validation of innovative gastrointestinal technologies, robotics, magnetism, image processing, artificial intelligence, and translation of research-engineering developments into clinical applications. Additionally, the investigators have a long-standing history of close and fruitful collaboration including R01 EB018992. If successful, this approach will demonstrate first in-human use of the MFE that reduces potential adverse events in an at-risk population (IBD patients), is intuitive to control, and integrates intelligent guidance into colon exploration and inspection. The robotic platform we propose has the potential to provide a safer, more accessible, and potentially painless alternative to standard colonoscopy for patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Ulcerative Colitis or Crohn's disease)-a disease that impacts the lives of over three million Americans, who are at a 6-fold increased risk for post-colonoscopy adverse events when compared to their non-lBD counterparts. The platform uses magnetic actuation, intelligent closed-loop control, and integrated assistive autonomy of our diagnostic and therapeutic magnetic flexible endoscope (MFE) to facilitate intuitive endoscopist-directed motion under precise control with a novel colon-visualization-index (CVI) that provides feedback to the endoscopist with estimates of the portion of colon lumen successfully imaged to maximize the yield of exam. We propose the first in-human study of a magnetically actuated robotic platform for colonoscopy and the first in-human demonstration of intelligent control with assistive autonomy using magnetic fields.",A magnetic capsule endoscope for colonoscopy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease,10121126,R01EB018992,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Articulation', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automation', 'Benchmarking', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Caliber', 'Cecum', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colon', 'Colonoscopes', 'Colonoscopy', 'Complication', 'Coupling', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Device Designs', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Distal', 'Dysplasia', 'Electric Wiring', 'Endoscopes', 'Endoscopy', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Family suidae', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Human', 'Image', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Injections', 'Insufflation', 'Intelligence', 'Intervention', 'Intubation', 'Intuition', 'Irrigation', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Mesentery', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Mucositis', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Nature', 'Nursing Faculty', 'Painless', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Perforation', 'Performance', 'Polyps', 'Populations at Risk', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Provider', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrieval', 'Risk', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Sedation procedure', 'Software Validation', 'Stream', 'Stretching', 'Suction', 'Surface', 'Technical Degree', 'Technical Expertise', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Validation', 'Vision', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'capsule', 'clinical application', 'colorectal cancer risk', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'detection method', 'experience', 'first-in-human', 'flexibility', 'gastrointestinal', 'human study', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'lifetime risk', 'magnetic field', 'novel', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'pain patient', 'phantom model', 'prevent', 'procedure safety', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'robot assistance', 'robot control', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'trial comparing']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,316138
"Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT There is a critical need to identify novel mechanisms of diabetic kidney disease (DKD) that will provide targets for new interventions. Chronic inflammation is one plausible mechanism. Using untargeted high-throughput aptamer proteomics, our recently published study has shed new light on specific, key inflammatory drivers of DKD. This was a large prospective three-cohort study that identified a novel and extremely robust circulating signature (KRIS) associated with risk of ESRD in diabetes. Our pilot study points to the data-driven connection between circulating KRIS and urinary profiles of the Complement pathway. Our hypothesis is that the Complement involvement in the kidney is a downstream effect of the systemic inflammatory processes mediating an increased DKD risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is to provide a high-resolution view of the involvement of the Complement proteome in progressive diabetic kidney disease. Aim 1 will comprehensively evaluate the etiological role of the urinary Complement proteome in progressive DKD leading to ESRD. This evaluation will leverage a prospective two-cohort population of Joslin Kidney Study (JKS) participants with an overt DKD at baseline followed for 10 years (primary outcome – incident ESRD). Measurements will utilize an aptamer proteomic technology (SOMAscan). Aim 2 will extend generalizability of the urinary Complement proteome to earlier DKD stages. The proposed study will be conducted in participants of the Preventing Early Renal Loss (PERL) clinical trial with predominantly normal renal function at baseline followed for 3 years (primary outcome - renal slope). Aim 3 proposes to gain direct insight into the intra-renal Complement proteome by targeted and untargeted protein studies in diabetic kidney tissue (Susztaklab Biobank). This project focuses on a significant public health problem, leverages the progressiveness of the disease, employs an innovative proteomic technology and stems from strong preliminary data. Advances in this project will pinpoint missing key components of DKD etiology, thereby accelerating drug development strategies for patients with diabetes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Diabetes accounts for approximately 45% of prevalent ESRD cases in the United States, therefore new interventions to prevent or decelerate development of kidney failure are critical in order to improve the health of patients with diabetes who comprise a large sector of the US population. This study will advance our knowledge regarding the etiology of diabetic kidney complications evaluating specific components of systemic (KRIS) and local, kidney inflammation (Complement). These advances offer long-term potential for the development of new therapies that will ultimately improve clinical outcomes of patients with diabetes.",Understanding the role of the Complement Proteome in progressive Diabetic Kidney Disease,10153779,R01DK123459,"['Address', 'Biological Markers', 'CCL2 gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diabetic Nephropathy', 'Disease Progression', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Histology', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Intervention', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Failure', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medicine', 'Nature', 'Nested Case-Control Study', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Progressive Disease', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Renal function', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Severity of illness', 'Signaling Protein', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Tissue Banks', 'Tissues', 'Tubular formation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor', 'United States', 'aptamer', 'biobank', 'cohort', 'complement pathway', 'complement system', 'diabetic', 'disorder risk', 'drug development', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'member', 'nephrogenesis', 'non-diabetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'prevent', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'stem', 'study population', 'systemic inflammatory response', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'urinary']",NIDDK,JOSLIN DIABETES CENTER,R01,2021,478789
"APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY Abstract  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) accounts for half of all pediatric leukemia deaths and is the leading cause of leukemia-related death in adulthood. One reason for worse outcomes is the inability to properly assess for minimal residual disease (MRD) following therapy. Unlike ALL, AML presents with multiple subclonal populations without a singular clonal surface marker, and surface markers can change during therapy. The current gold standard for AML MRD is multi-parameter flow cytometry (MPFC), which is predictive of outcomes to frequencies of 0.001, yet 30% of MPFC-MRD-negative patients still relapse. Alternatively, every AML case harbors leukemia-specific mutations that could be markers of disease, except that next-generation sequencing has high error rate of ~1%. In this proposal, we will implement a novel, validated error-corrected sequencing (ECS) strategy, developed by the Druley lab in collaboration with Illumina, to improve MRD assessment of AML subclonal heterogeneity in 990 pediatric de novo AML cases from the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 study. We hypothesize that using a highly sensitive sequencing method will improve identification of residual AML, provide important insights on subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, improve understanding of the role of germline variability and gene function on relapses or refractory disease and facilitate personalized medicine. To interrogate this hypothesis, we propose the following aims: 1. Define subclonal heterogeneity at diagnosis and end of Induction 1 (EOI1) in 990 pediatric de novo  AML patients (n=1890). By using the largest prospective study of pediatric AML that has ever been  performed, we will perform ECS on 94 genes that are the most frequently mutated genes in pediatric and  adult AML at diagnosis and EOI1 to identify patterns of mutation associated with relapsed disease, FAB  subtypes or other cytogenetic features. 2. Correlate ECS-MRD with existing EOI1 MPFC-MRD for all participants in the COG AAML1031 study.  A major question is whether the “different from normal” cell population identified as residual disease by  MPFC is actually the same population(s) identified by ECS. We will define residual disease by ECS and  compare results to MPFC status (positive/negative), actual MPFC percentages (<0.001) and the clinical  outcomes (relapse risk, disease-free survival and overall survival) of study participants. 3. Integrate germline variation and all subclonal mutations into mechanistic groups that are frequently  mutated in pediatric AML and correlate with outcomes using unbiased machine learning  algorithms. Preliminary data tells us that every patient will have multiple subclones at diagnosis and EOI1  as well as germline variants in AML-associated genes, which may be important for outcome. In this aim, we  will take these mutations into account as well as MPFC, clinical features and cytogenetics for probabilistic  risk assessment using unsupervised machine learning algorithms for improved outcome prognostication. Narrative We have developed Error-Corrected Sequencing (ECS) that enables the highly accurate detection of leukemia- specific mutations in heterogeneous DNA samples to a limit of 0.0001. We will perform ECS with a panel of 94 frequently mutated genes in adult and pediatric AML in matched diagnostic and end of Induction 1 bone marrow samples from 990 pediatric de novo AML patients enrolled on the Children's Oncology Group AAML1031 protocol, which is the largest pediatric AML trial ever performed in North America. With these data, we can truly understand subclonal heterogeneity in pediatric AML, significantly improve minimal residual disease testing in pediatric AML, and integrate these data into an unbiased multivariate probability platform taking into account individual sequencing, flow cytometry, cytogenetic and clinical features to provide truly personalized cancer care.",APPLYING ERROR-CORRECTED SEQUENCING TO DETECT MINIMAL RESIDUAL IN THE AAML 1031 STUDY,10063814,R01CA211711,"['Acute Myelocytic Leukemia', 'Adult', 'Adult Acute Myeloblastic Leukemia', 'Alleles', 'BAY 54-9085', 'Biological Markers', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bortezomib', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Childhood', 'Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia', 'Childhood Leukemia', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Cytogenetics', 'DNA', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Marker', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Enrollment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'FLT3 gene', 'Family', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Normal Cell', 'North America', 'Oncogenes', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pediatric Oncology Group', 'Phase', 'Point Mutation', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein Tyrosine Kinase', 'Protein phosphatase', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reagent', 'Recurrent disease', 'Refractory Disease', 'Relapse', 'Residual Neoplasm', 'Residual Tumors', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Site', 'Spliceosomes', 'Surface', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemotherapy', 'cohesion', 'design', 'detection limit', 'digital', 'falls', 'functional group', 'gene function', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'leukemia', 'leukemia treatment', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel', 'nucleocytoplasmic transport', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'personalized cancer care', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'relapse risk', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'specific biomarkers', 'subclonal heterogeneity', 'transcription factor', 'unsupervised learning']",NCI,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,352587
"PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) Project Summary The objective of PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP) is to discover novel biomarker signatures of post cardiac arrest brain and extracerebral organ failure that predict treatment responsiveness and long-term recovery. We will achieve this by partnering with the ICECAP trial, a response-adaptive dose finding clinical research trial that seeks to determine the optimal duration of post-arrest hypothermia. Cardiac arrest is a major public health problem with high morbidity and mortality. Four in five patients hospitalized after cardiac arrest have significant brain injury, and death from neurologic damage is common. Improving survival and functional recovery is a critical public health objective and will require innovative approaches. The current clinical situation is unprecedented. Currently post-CA brain injury is an acute, sudden critical illness with major knowledge gaps about how best to characterize severity of injury and to identify which individual patients are likely to benefit from specific neuroprotective strategies. Thus, development of high- performing biomarker signatures is a critical need and would translate in to immediate changes in care. We hypothesize that not all patients are identical (i.e. there will be a heterogeneity of treatment effect) and that through our innovative, multi-parametric data driven approach, we will be able to identify novel signatures that define subgroups of patients. Advanced data science and analytical approaches will allow the identification of these subgroups that was previously not possible. These subgroups will be clinically important insofar as they will indicate differential responses to treatment and different trajectories of functional recovery. This project will acquire high resolution multi-modal data early in the disease course that will allow us to address these current knowledge gaps and improve our understanding of the disease in the early acute setting when interventions can improve outcome. The knowledge learned here will be applied to develop personalized treatments for cardiac arrest survivors, addressing the NIH's and our goals of lengthening life and reducing disability. Project Narrative Post-cardiac arrest injury affects the brain and other critical organs and is a major public health problem causing significant death and disability. This project will use novel data-driven approaches to collect high resolution monitoring data from patients in the critical care unit and will use that multi-parametric data to develop newly defined patient sub-groups with differing clinical trajectories and responses to therapies. This project will have a major impact on public health by allowing treatment of the right patient at the right time with the right therapy, thereby reducing disability and saving lives.",PREcision Care In Cardiac ArrEst - ICECAP (PRECICECAP),10099869,R01NS119825,"['Acute', 'Acute Disease', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Death', 'Brain Injuries', 'Cardiopulmonary', 'Cardiopulmonary Physiology', 'Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Heart Arrest', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Examination', 'Neurosciences', 'Organ', 'Organ failure', 'Outcome', 'Patient Rights', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Public Health', 'Pupil light reflex', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Rewarming', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Standardization', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Titrations', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Work', 'advanced analytics', 'arm', 'base', 'biomarker signature', 'candidate marker', 'clinical care', 'clinical predictors', 'design', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'natural hypothermia', 'novel', 'novel marker', 'outcome prediction', 'patient subsets', 'personalized care', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'predictive marker', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'prognostic value', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'response', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'treatment arm', 'treatment effect', 'treatment response', 'unsupervised learning']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1648754
"Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions Project Summary/Abstract Atrial Fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of stroke 5-fold and accounts for roughly 15% of all strokes in the United States. Many individuals may have undiagnosed AF whose arrhythmia does not prompt evaluation either because of minimal symptoms or brief episodes. Oral anticoagulation (OAC) is highly effective at reducing stroke risk in patients with AF, but is only prescribed to individuals with recognized disease. Identifying subjects with undiagnosed AF is important so they may be treated with OAC and prevent strokes from occurring. This project will help advance our knowledge of screening patients for undiagnosed AF in the primary care setting by identifying patients at high risk of developing AF for targeted clinic and home-based screening strategies. Fundamental questions of who to target and how to implement a screening program in the United States remain unanswered. To address these gaps in knowledge, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a career development program that blends rigorous methodologic and content area training with an innovative research agenda. This plan has three scientific objectives: 1) To identify predictors of AF incidence from electronic health record structured and free-text data, 2) To develop and implement an electronic algorithm that improves upon existing models to identify patients at increased risk for AF in a primary care population, and 3) To implement and evaluate feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of a clinic and home-based screening program to identify undiagnosed AF. This project aligns with several objectives of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Strategic Vision by implementing novel diagnostic tools to diagnose AF and prevent strokes, by optimizing clinical and implementation research to improve health and reduce disease, and leveraging emerging opportunities in data science, through the use of natural language processing of text data in the electronic health record, to improve identification of patients at high risk for AF. The long-term goal of this career development award is to establish the PI as an independent researcher with expertise in cardiovascular disease and targeting populations for prevention of cardiovascular disease events. Career development activities include training in biomedical informatics, data mining and risk prediction, survey research design, implementation research, and cardiovascular disease pathophysiology and clinical management through formal coursework, clinical shadowing, as well as mentorship by an exceptionally qualified team of senior scientists. Successful completion of this career development proposal will improve prediction of which patients are at the highest risk of developing AF, and evaluate how to use this risk information to implement an effective screening strategy in primary care. Pilot data from this award will lay the groundwork for a highly competitive application for NIH R01 funding. Project Narrative Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of ischemic stroke and the prevalence is estimated to increase from 5.2 million adults in the United States to more than 12 million by 2030, however, many additional individuals have undiagnosed disease. The proposed research program will significantly advance our understanding of screening for undiagnosed atrial fibrillation, by 1) improving identification of patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation, and 2) targeting patients at high risk of developing atrial fibrillation in the primary care setting with an efficient strategy for clinic and home-based screening. This program will significantly increase knowledge of how to overcome the real-world issue of how to effectively and efficiently screen for atrial fibrillation in clinical practice.",Identifying primary care patients at increased risk of atrial fibrillation for screening interventions,10188627,K01HL148506,"['Address', 'Adhesives', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anticoagulation', 'Area', 'Arrhythmia', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Award', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'General Hospitals', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Technology', 'Home environment', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Ischemic Stroke', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Massachusetts', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oral', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Health Care', 'Principal Investigator', 'Program Development', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Senior Scientist', 'Stroke', 'Stroke prevention', 'Structure', 'Survey Methodology', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Target Populations', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cardiovascular disorder prevention', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data registry', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'implementation research', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'innovation', 'mHealth', 'medical specialties', 'mobile computing', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient screening', 'population based', 'practice setting', 'primary care setting', 'programs', 'prospective', 'randomized trial', 'risk minimization', 'risk prediction', 'screening', 'screening program', 'stroke risk', 'structured data', 'tool', 'usability']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2021,177788
"A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors PROJECT ABSTRACT Advances in acute care have decreased short-term mortality of sepsis, resulting in an increasing number of survivors who experience significant morbidity and mortality. Recurrent infections account for 60% of hospital readmissions after sepsis and are an important cause of long-term mortality. Identifying sepsis survivors at risk for infections and understanding predisposing factors are therefore important first steps to develop personalized interventions to improve long-term outcomes. The overall research goal is to develop innovative targeted interventions to improve long-term outcomes after sepsis. This proposal focuses on identifying subgroups of sepsis survivors (phenotypes) at high risk for infection-related hospital readmissions and deaths. It is hypothesized that the combination of host factors, disease characteristics, and interventions prior to and during sepsis will identify distinct phenotypes that are captured by clinical data. These clinical phenotypes likely have distinct pathophysiologic mechanisms (e.g., immunosuppression), predispose to different outcomes (e.g., recurrent infections), and patients with the same phenotype may respond similarly to targeted interventions such as immunomodulation. In Aim 1, three nationally representative datasets of sepsis survivors will be assembled and analyzed by machine learning techniques to identify valid clinical sepsis phenotypes. In Aim 2, phenotypes at high-risk for infection-related readmissions and deaths at 6 months will be identified, and underlying biomarker profiles for these phenotypes analyzed. In Aim 3, these high-risk phenotypes will be used to conceptualize and simulate an adaptive platform trial designed to test the efficacy of three different immunomodulatory drugs. An adaptive trial design was chosen, because it can test multiple interventions simultaneously and reduces the chances of exposing patients to ineffective or harmful interventions. The research plan is augmented by expert mentoring and rigorous didactic training. Together, this will provide the candidate with essential career development skills in the science of precision medicine, including machine learning methodologies, Bayesian statistics, and innovate clinical trial design. This proposal has potentially groundbreaking implications for the future treatment of sepsis survivors, because it deviates from the current “one-size fits all” approach and attempts to create the framework for personalized interventions. This framework sets the stage for future independent investigator (RO1) applications evaluating personalized treatments in adaptive clinical trials, and will uniquely position the candidate as a future leader in the field of long-term outcomes after critical illness. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project is important for public health because sepsis is a life-threatening infection that affects 30 million people worldwide each year. Long-term outcomes for patients who survive a hospital admission for sepsis are poor, and many patients develop new disabilities or worsening of preexisting health conditions. This proposal supports the NIH’s mission to enhance health and reduce illness and disability by trying to identify interventions for sepsis survivors at highest risk for poor outcomes.",A precision medicine framework to improve long-term outcomes in Sepsis Survivors,10120705,K23GM132688,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Asthma', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological Markers', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Complex', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'HLA Antigens', 'Health', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunomodulators', 'Immunosuppression', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Integration Host Factors', 'Interleukin-7', 'Intervention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multicenter Studies', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Phenotype', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposing Factor', 'Probability', 'Public Health', 'Recombinants', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Sepsis', 'Subgroup', 'Survivors', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Veterans', 'Whole Blood', 'Work', 'acute care', 'anti-PD-1', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy testing', 'experience', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'immunomodulatory therapies', 'immunoregulation', 'improved', 'infection risk', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized approach', 'personalized intervention', 'personalized medicine', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'recurrent infection', 'response', 'simulation', 'skill acquisition', 'trial design']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K23,2021,185808
