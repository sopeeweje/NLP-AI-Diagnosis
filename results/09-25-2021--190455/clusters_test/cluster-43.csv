"Biomedical Data Translator Development of Autonomous Relay Agent: ARAX This project would continue collaborative work within the Translator consortium by a multi-site team (“Team X-ray”) at Oregon State University (PI Stephen Ramsey) and at two partner institutions, Pennsylvania State University (PI Koslicki) and the Institute for Systems Biology (PI Eric Deutsch; Co-I Jared Roach). Team X-ray was highly productive in Translator's feasibility assessment phase and the team brings critical expertise to Translator (see Resources). Component type: We propose to create, validate, and integrate an autonomous relay agent (ARA) called ARAX . ARAX will be a middleware component in the new Translator architecture that will extend significantly beyond the capabilities of the prototype reasoning tool (RTX) that we created in the feasibility assessment phase. Depending on the input request, ARAX's main output will be ranked subgraphs with clearly explained ranking basis. ARAX will leverage code and algorithms from RTX and will have an explicit application focus area, as described below. Main problems that ARAX is trying to address: Connections within a biomedical knowledge graph have highly variable degrees of (i) confidence (due to ambiguous predicates and/or due to highly variable degrees of reliability of knowledge types) and (ii) potential relevance to the user's query. Such edge-significance variability leads to both incorrect and difficult-to-interpret results which together pose a significant problem for creating broadly useful tools for computer-based biomedical reasoning. We propose to address this problem by explicitly accounting for these two types of edge variability in the reasoning algorithms–spanning a broad range of biomedical query types–that ARAX will provide to Translator. In addition to these broad capabilities, as described in the Project Plan, we will incorporate advanced algorithms in ARAX for responding to queries relating to disease therapy, including (1) drug repositioning for known disease, leveraging knowledge about the disease’s pathogenesis [1] ; and (2) therapeutic recommendations for rare diseases based on symptoms and the putative causal genetic variant. Plan for implementation of the project: In our Project Plan we describe a five-year timeline for creating, validating, and integrating ARAX within Translator, beginning with a three-month sprint leading to a prototype of ARAX by mid-March 2020. Key components of the plan include: (1) leveraging the BioThings Explorer software framework to enable ARAX to dynamically map between compounds, proteins, pathways, variants, phenotypes, and diseases based on knowledge source application programming interfaces in the Translator registry; (2) leveraging COHD and related Translator resources to obtain biomedical semantic distance information; (3) leveraging an application programming interface endpoint for the RTX biomedical knowledge graph, KG2; and (4) implementing probabilistic reasoning algorithms leveraging provenance information and dynamically determined edge relevance scores to improve reasoning. We will systematically use machine-learning to align ranking scores with measures of output quality. Collaboration strengths of our team include (i) developing technical standards for communications between Translator software agents (leveraging PI Deutsch’s extensive past experience); (ii) developing knowledge graph standards (leveraging PI Ramsey’s and PI Koslicki’s expertise); and (iii) deriving use-case vignettes that speak to the transformative potential of Translator (leveraging Co-I Roach’s and PI Ramsey’s expertise). In the development phase, our team would continue to collaborate with other teams and with NIH stakeholders in an adaptive, high-bandwidth, and team-boundary-agnostic fashion, as detailed in the Project Plan. Key challenges to building the proposed system are (1) the need to be able to ""chain"" together analytical steps between tools and (2) the need for cooperative development of standards that enable Translator components to interact; we address them in detail in the Project Plan. n/a",Biomedical Data Translator Development of Autonomous Relay Agent: ARAX,10333468,OT2TR003428,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Oregon', 'Output', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pennsylvania', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Resources', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Semantics', 'Site', 'Software Framework', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Therapeutic', 'TimeLine', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'application programming interface', 'base', 'experience', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'knowledge graph', 'middleware', 'prototype', 'tool']",NCATS,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,OT2,2021,897051
"DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets Component type: This Knowledge Provider project will continue and significantly extend work done by the Translator Consortium Blue Team, focusing on deriving knowledge from real-world data through complex analytic workflows, integrated to the Translator Knowledge Graph, and served via tools like Big GIM and the Translator Standard API. The problem: We aim to solve the “first mile” problem of translational research: how to integrate the multitude of dynamic small-to-large data sets that have been produced by the research and clinical communities, but that are in different locations, processed in different ways, and in a variety of formats that may not be mutually interoperable. Integrating these data sets requires significant manual work downloading, reformatting, parsing, indexing and analyzing each data set in turn. The technical and ethical challenges of accessing diverse collections of big data, efficiently selecting information relevant to different users’ interests, and extracting the underlying knowledge are problems that remain unsolved. Here, we propose to leverage lessons distilled from our previous and ongoing big data analysis projects to develop a highly automated tool for removing these bottlenecks, enabling researchers to analyze and integrate many valuable data sets with ease and efficiency, and making the data FAIR [1]. Plan: (AIM 1) We will analyze and extract knowledge from rich real-world biomedical data sets (listed in the Resources page) in the domains of wellness, cancer, and large-scale clinical records. (AIM 2) We will formalize methods from Aim 1 to develop DOCKET, a novel tool for onboarding and integrating data from multiple domains. (AIM 3) We will work with other teams to adapt DOCKET to additional knowledge domains. ■ The DOCKET tool will offer 3 modules: (1) DOCKET Overview: Analysis of, and knowledge extraction from, an individual data set. (2) DOCKET Compare: Comparing versions of the same data set to compute confidence values, and comparing different data sets to find commonalities. (3) DOCKET Integrate: Deriving knowledge through integrating different data sets. ■ Researchers will be able to parameterize these functions, resolve inconsistencies, and derive knowledge through the command line, Jupyter notebooks, or other interfaces as specified by Translator Standards. ■ The outcome will be a collection of nodes and edges, richly annotated with context, provenance and confidence levels, ready for incorporation into the Translator Knowledge Graph (TKG). ■ All analyses and derived knowledge will be stored in standardized formats, enabling querying through the Reasoner Std API and ingestion into downstream AI assisted machine learning. ■ Example questions this will allow us to address include: (Wellness) Which clinical analytes, metabolites, proteins, microbiome taxa, etc. are significantly correlated, and which changing analytes predict transition to which disease? [2,3] (Cancer) Which gene mutations in any of X pathways are associated with sensitivity or resistance to any of Y drugs, in cell lines from Z tumor types? (All data sets) Which data set entities are similar to this one? Are there significant clusters? What distinguishes between the clusters? What significant correlations of attributes can be observed? How can this set of entities be expanded by adding similar ones? How do these N versions of this data set differ, and how stable is each knowledge edge as the data set changes over time? Collaboration strengths: Our team has extensive experience with biomedical and domain-agnostic data analytics, integrating multiple relevant data types: omics, clinical measurements and electronic health records (EHRs). We have participated in large collaborative consortia and have subject matter experts willing to advise on proper data interpretation. Our application synergizes with those of other Translator teams (see Letters of Collaboration). Challenges: Data can come in a bewildering diversity of formats. Our solution will be modular, will address the most common formats first, and will leverage established technologies like DataFrames and importers (like pandas.io) where possible. Mapping nodes and edge types onto standard ontologies is crucial for knowledge integration; we will collaborate with the Standards component to maximize success. n/a",DOCKET: accelerating knowledge extraction from biomedical data sets,10330627,OT2TR003443,"['Address', 'Big Data', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Ethics', 'FAIR principles', 'Gene Mutation', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Ontology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'Records', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Resources', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Standardization', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'experience', 'indexing', 'interest', 'interoperability', 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge integration', 'large datasets', 'microbiome', 'novel', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCATS,INSTITUTE FOR SYSTEMS BIOLOGY,OT2,2021,332969
"High Performance Text Mining for Translator We propose to build a knowledge provider that will seek out, integrate and provide AI-ready, BioLink-compatible models via high-performance text-mining of the biomedical literature. Problems with Translator’s current mining of the biomedical literature that we intend to solve include: (1) weaknesses in framework extensibility and benchmarking that make integrating and validating new text-mining approaches difficult; (2) problematic licensing of software, terminologies and other resources that do not adequately support FAIR (and TLC) best practices; (3) processing only PubMed titles and abstracts, not full text publications; (4) Translator’s use of older NLP technology with relatively poor performance; (5) lack of a mechanism for community feedback regarding errors and other problems; (6) lack of continuous updates to add knowledge from new publications; (7) output knowledge representation that is simplistic and vague, failing to reflect the richness of what is expressed in scientific documents. Plan for implementation: Our team has a long history of productive NLP research, successful open source software projects, effective benchmarking and broad community engagement. We will build on the results of NLM-funded work in information extraction, our gold-standard Colorado Richly Annotated Full Text (CRAFT) corpus, a recent BioNLP Open Shared Task (BioNLP-OST) that we organized, and recent advances in state-of-the-art NLP. For Segment 1, we will: (1) Demonstrate BioStacks, an extensible, cloud-based text-mining framework that produces knowledge graphs grounded in the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBOs). This BioStacks demo will include a state-of-the-art OBO concept recognizer for multiple ontologies, a state-of-the-art semantic relationship prediction tool, and a state-of-the-art structural analysis tool. All generated assertions will have provenance metadata linking the assertion to a particular text span in a document specified by PMCID. (2) Demonstrate CRAFTST, a cloud-based text-mining evaluation system that evaluates the performance of text-mining systems against the CRAFT gold standard. (3) Demonstrate an adaptive machine learning process illustrating how to efficiently create tools to extract BioLink association types. For Segment 2, we propose to extend the text-mining and evaluation frameworks to align with BioLink and the Translator community, improve text-mining quality and expand the collection of source documents mined. Specifically, we propose to target 10 long term milestones: (1) Align CRAFT to BioLink. (2) Develop new tools for extracting associations from text. (3) Develop and manage a community engagement process on text-mining for Translator. (4) Extend benchmarking. (5) Improve recall. (6) Improve precision. (7) Improve computational efficiency. (8) Expand BioStacks to include all available full text biomedical journal articles. (9) Expand document collections to include Patents & Regulatory filings. (10) Develop a scientist-based movement to improve document access for text-mining from non-open publishers. The types of questions the resulting knowledge graph can be used to address are extremely broad, as it is generated by mining a large part of the biomedical literature. Questions that can be answered include those about specific assertions (e.g. is this drug an agonist-activator of this protein?), general relations (are these two proteins often mentioned together?), and documents (which publications mention this gene, mutation and drug?). Integration: We are long-time contributors to the open-science community and have longstanding collaborations with existing awardees; we were participants in the NIH Data Commons Pilot. We propose to align the output of text-mining tools to the BioLink model via OBO terms. We propose to implement our frameworks in NIH Cloud Computing environments. We propose to adopt the CD2H Contributor Attribution Model to foreground community contributions. We plan to coordinate with the NLM’s nascent benchmarking activities and the SmartAPI effort to build Translator standard interfaces. Challenges and gaps: High-performance mining of rich, contextualized knowledge from the literature remains a difficult task, and is unlikely to be solved in the next five years. Many important publications remain inaccessible to text-mining due to restrictive licensing. n/a",High Performance Text Mining for Translator,10334356,OT2TR003422,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Agonist', 'Benchmarking', 'Cloud Computing', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data Commons', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gene Mutation', 'Gold', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Legal patent', 'Licensing', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Movement', 'Ontology', 'Output', 'Participant', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Terminology', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical ontology', 'cloud based', 'improved', 'information organization', 'journal article', 'knowledge graph', 'knowledge of results', 'open data', 'open source', 'text searching', 'tool']",NCATS,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,OT2,2021,471239
"The Metadata Powerwash - Integrated tools to make biomedical data FAIR Project Summary  The metadata that describe scientific data are fundamental resources to enable (1) the discovery and reuse of the data and (2) the reproducibility of the experiments that generated the data in the first place. Metadata are essential for scientists to understand the associated data and to reuse them, as well as for information technology to index the data, to make the data available, and to provide filters for scientists to search for the corresponding datasets. Currently, the scientific metadata hosted in public repositories suffer from multiple quality issues that limit scientists’ ability to find and reuse the experimental datasets to which they refer. It can take many weeks of a scientist’s time to identify a collection of datasets that fulfill specific criteria when the data are so poorly described—and the majority of the process is necessarily manual.  We propose to develop an end-to-end solution to standardize biomedical metadata with the help of ontologies—data structures that define the terms in an application domain and the relationships among them. There are hundreds of ontologies that provide standard terms for use in biomedicine, and they are essential resources to make biomedical metadata interoperable and reusable. Our approach also will build on the technology created by the Center for Expanded Data Annotation and Retrieval (CEDAR), which offers a library of building blocks and common data elements for defining computer-based metadata templates based on community standards.  Our plan involves three specific aims. First, we will develop a method and tool to standardize the multiple, ad hoc metadata field names that may appear in metadata to represent the same type of information by replacing those field names with the field names used in standard metadata templates or, if no appropriate template match is available, with terms from a relevant ontology. Second, we will develop methods and tools to standardize different types of metadata field values, for example, categorical values such as drugs or diseases, and numerical values such as age, or sample collection date. Third, we will evaluate the speed, precision, and recall of our metadata transformation pipeline—built out of the methods and tools to standardize field names and values—on a large corpus of metadata that we will manually curate based on existing public metadata. We will also carry out experiments to test the effect of the standardized metadata when biomedical scientists perform dataset search in the context of their work. Project Narrative Data that offer precise descriptions of data—metadata—are critical scientific resources that facilitate the discovery, reuse, and reproducibility of the data to which they refer. Our goal is to create methods and tools that improve the quality of scientific metadata hosted in public repositories, and thus enhance the discoverability and re-use of public biomedical datasets. Making data more accessible through scientifically rigorous metadata will accelerate the ability to make transformative data-driven biomedical discoveries using public data archives.",The Metadata Powerwash - Integrated tools to make biomedical data FAIR,10093841,R01LM013498,"['Age', 'Biological Specimen Banks', 'Categories', 'Collection', 'Common Data Element', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'FAIR principles', 'Funding Agency', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Information Technology', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Manuals', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Numerical value', 'Ontology', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Retrieval', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'biomedical scientist', 'data archive', 'data repository', 'data reuse', 'experimental study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'information organization', 'interoperability', 'metadata standards', 'public repository', 'repository', 'sample collection', 'search engine', 'secondary analysis', 'tool']",NLM,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,334847
"Temporal relation discovery for clinical text Project Summary / Abstract The current proposal continues the investigation on the topic of temporal relation extraction from the Electronic Medical Records (EMR) clinical narrative funded by the NLM since 2010 (Temporal Histories of Your Medical Events, or THYME; thyme.healthnlp.org). Through our efforts so far, we have defined the topic as an active area of research attracting attention across the world. Since its inception, the project has pushed the boundaries of this highly challenging task by investigating new computational methods within the context of the latest developments in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI) and biomedical informatics (BMI) resulting in 60+ publications/presentations. We have made our best performing methods available to the community open source as part of the Apache Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES; ctakes.apache.org). In 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018, we organized an international shared task (Clinical TempEval) on the topic under the umbrella of the highly prestigious SemEval, thus inviting the international community to work with our THYME data and improve on our results. Clinical TempEval has been highly successful with many participants each year, resulting in new discoveries and many publications. We have made all our data along with our gold standard annotations available to the community through the hNLP Center (center.healthnlp.org).  The underlying theme of this renewal is novel methods for combining explicit domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical), readily available unlabeled data (health-related social media, EMRs), and modern machine learning techniques (e.g. neural networks) for temporal relation extraction from the EMR clinical narrative. Therefore, our renewal proposes a novel and much needed exploration of this line of research:  Specific Aim 1: Develop computational models for novel rich semantic representations such as the Abstract Meaning Representations to encapsulate a single, coherent, full-document graphical representation of meaning for temporal relation extraction  Specific Aim 2: Develop computational methods to infuse domain knowledge (linguistic, semantic, biomedical ontological, clinical) into modern machine learning techniques such as NNs for temporal relation extraction – through input representations, pre-trained vectors, or architectures  Specific Aim 3: Develop novel methods for combining labeled and unlabeled data from various sources (EMR, health-related social media, newswire) for temporal relation extraction from the clinical narrative  Specific Aim 4: Apply the best performing methods for temporal relation extraction developed in SA1-3 to temporally sensitive phenotypes for direct translational sciences studies. Dissemination efforts through publications and open source releases into Apache cTAKES. Project Narrative Temporal relations are of prime importance in biomedicine as they are intrinsically linked to diseases, signs and symptoms, and treatments. Understanding the timeline of clinically relevant events is key to the next generation of translational research where the importance of generalizing over large amounts of data holds the promise of deciphering biomedical puzzles. The goal of our current proposal is to automatically discover temporal relations from clinical free text and structured EMR data and create an aggregated patient-level timeline.",Temporal relation discovery for clinical text,10176589,R01LM010090,"['Address', 'Apache', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attention', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Encapsulated', 'Engineering', 'Event', 'Fostering', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Image', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Knowledge Extraction', 'Label', 'Linguistics', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Nature', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Publications', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Semantics', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Solid', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Thyme', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Vision', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'biomedical ontology', 'clinically relevant', 'cohesion', 'electronic data', 'electronic structure', 'epidemiology study', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'learning community', 'neural network', 'next generation', 'novel', 'open source', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'social media', 'support vector machine', 'symptom treatment', 'vector']",NLM,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,531398
"Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews Summary ​Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Evidence-based Medicine (EBM) aims to inform patient care using all available evidence. Realizing this aim in practice would require access to concise, comprehensive, and up-to-date structured summaries of the evidence relevant to a particular clinical question. Systematic reviews of biomedical literature aim to provide such summaries, and are a critical component of the EBM arsenal and modern medicine more generally. However, such reviews are extremely laborious to conduct. Furthermore, owing to the rapid expansion of the biomedical literature base, they tend to go out of date quickly as new evidence emerges. These factors hinder the practice of evidence-based care. In this renewal proposal, we seek to continue our ground-breaking efforts on developing, evaluating, and deploying novel machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) methods to automate or semi-automate the evidence synthesis process. This will extend our innovative and successful efforts developing RobotReviewer and related technologies under the current grant. Concretely, for this renewal we propose to move from extraction of clinically salient data elements from individual trials to synthesis of these elements across trials. Our first aim is to extend our ML and NLP models to produce (as one deliverable) a publicly available, continuously and automatically updated semi-structured evidence database, comprising extracted data for all evidence, both published and unpublished. Unpublished trials will be identified via trial registries. Taking this up-to-date evidence repository as a starting point, we then propose cutting-edge ML and NLP models that will generate first drafts of evidence syntheses, automatically. More specifically we propose novel neural cross-document summarization models that will capitalize on the semi-structured information automatically extracted by our existing models, in addition to article texts. These models will be deployed in a new version of RobotReviewer, called RobotReviewerLive, intended to be a prototype for “living” systematic reviews. To rigorously evaluate the practical utility of the proposed methodological innovations, we will pilot their use to support real, ongoing, exemplar living reviews. Semi-Automating Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews (​Renewal) Narrative We propose novel machine learning and natural language processing methods that will aid biomedical literature summarization and synthesis, and thereby support the conduct of evidence-based medicine (EBM). The proposed models and technologies will motivate core methodological innovations and support real-time, up-to-date, semi-automated biomedical evidence syntheses (“systematic reviews”).

"Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks ABSTRACT Relations linking various biomedical entities constitute a crucial resource that enables biomedical data science applications and knowledge discovery. Relational information spans the translational science spectrum going from biology (e.g., protein–protein interactions) to translational bioinformatics (e.g., gene–disease associations), and eventually to clinical care (e.g., drug–drug interactions). Scientists report newly discovered relations in nat- ural language through peer-reviewed literature and physicians may communicate them in clinical notes. More recently, patients are also reporting side-effects and adverse events on social media. With exponential growth in textual data, advances in biomedical natural language processing (BioNLP) methods are gaining prominence for biomedical relation extraction (BRE) from text. Most current efforts in BRE follow a pipeline approach containing named entity recognition (NER), entity normalization (EN), and relation classiﬁcation (RC) as subtasks. They typically suffer from error snowballing — errors in a component of the pipeline leading to more downstream errors — resulting in lower performance of the overall BRE system. This situation has lead to evaluation of different BRE substaks conducted in isolation. In this proposal we make a strong case for strictly end-to-end evaluations where relations are to be produced from raw text. We propose novel deep neural network architectures that model BRE in an end-to-end fashion and directly identify relations and corresponding entity spans in a single pass. We also extend our architectures to n-ary and cross-sentence settings where more than two entities may need to be linked even as the relation is expressed across multiple sentences. We also propose to create two new gold standard BRE datasets, one for drug–disease treatment relations and another ﬁrst of a kind dataset for combination drug therapies. Our main hypothesis is that our end-to-end extraction models will yield supe- rior performance when compared with traditional pipelines. We test this through (1). intrinsic evaluations based on standard performance measures with several gold standard datasets and (2). extrinsic application oriented assessments of relations extracted with use-cases in information retrieval, question answering, and knowledge base completion. All software and data developed as part of this project will be made available for public use and we hope this will foster rigorous end-to-end benchmarking of BRE systems. NARRATIVE Relations connecting biomedical entities are at the heart of biomedical research given they encapsulate mech- anisms of disease etiology, progression, and treatment. As most such relations are ﬁrst disclosed in textual narratives (scientiﬁc literature or clinical notes), methods to extract and represent them in a structured format are essential to facilitate applications such as hypotheses generation, question answering, and information retrieval. The high level objective of this project is to develop and evaluate novel end-to-end supervised machine learning methods for biomedical relation extraction using latest advances in deep neural networks.",Advanced End-to-End Relation Extraction with Deep Neural Networks,10200889,R01LM013240,"['Adverse event', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Combination Drug Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Drug Interactions', 'Encapsulated', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Fostering', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hand', 'Heart', 'Information Retrieval', 'Information Sciences', 'Intramural Research', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Label', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Names', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Patients', 'Peer Review', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physicians', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Review Literature', 'Scientist', 'Semantics', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Terminology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Trees', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'clinical care', 'deep neural network', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'knowledge base', 'machine learning method', 'natural language', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'off-label use', 'protein protein interaction', 'relating to nervous system', 'side effect', 'social media', 'supervised learning', 'syntax']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R01,2021,332681
"xARA: ARA through Explainable AI In response to the NIH FOA OTA-19009 “Biomedical Translator: Development” we propose to build an Autonomous Relay Agent (ARA) that can characterize and rate the quality of information returned from multiple multiscale heterogeneous knowledge providers (KPs). Biomedical researchers develop a trust relationship with a knowledge provider (KP) through frequent and continued use. Over time a familiarity develops that drives their understanding and insight on 1) how to structure and invoke more effective queries, 2) the quality of the results they may expect in response to different query parameters and feature values, and 3) how to assess the relevancy of a specific query’s results. Although this information retrieval paradigm has served the research community moderately well in the past it is not scalable and the number, scope and complexity of KPs is increasing at a dramatic pace (1,613 molecular biology databases reported as of Jan. 2019). Within this ever changing information landscape, a biomedical researcher now has two choices -- either continue using the few KPs they have learned to trust but remain limited in the actionable information they will receive, or invest the time and accept the risk of using a range of new information resources with little or no familiarity and thus uncertain effectiveness. If researchers are to benefit from the vast array of NIH and industry sponsored information assets now available and expanding new information retrieval and quality assessment technologies will be required. We propose to build an Explanatory Autonomous Relay Agent (xARA) that can characterize query results by rating the quality of information returned from multi-scale heterogeneous KPs. The xARA will utilize multiple information retrieval and explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI) strategies to perform queries across multiple heterogeneous KPs and rank their results by quality and relevancy while also identifying and explaining any inconsistencies among databases for the same query response. To deliver on this promise, we will utilize case-based reasoning and language models trained with biomedical data (i.e., BioBERT and custom annotation embeddings through Reactome and UniProt) permitting a new level of query profiling and assessment. Our strategies will permit 1) information gaps to be filled by testing alternative query patterns that produce different surface syntax yet possess semantically related and actionable concepts, 2) inconsistencies to be identified for a given query feature value, and 3) the identification and elimination or merging of semantically redundant query results via similarity metrics enriched by case-based reasoning strategies employed in the explainable AI (xAI) community to identify machine learning model behavior and performance. The xARA capabilities proposed herein will be based on strategies developed in Dr. Weber’s lab for information retrieval where the desire for greater transparency when reasoning over experimental data is our primary aim. Our multi-institutional team is comprised of senior researchers and software engineers formally trained and experienced in the computer and data sciences, cheminformatics, bioinformatics, molecular biology, and biochemistry. Inherent risks in querying heterogeneous KPs include the presence of inconsistent labeling of the same biomedical concept within unique KP data structures. Manual engineering may be necessary to overcome such hurdles, but will not be a significant challenge for the initial prototype, since only two well documented KPs are being evaluated. Another noteworthy risk is that the quality of word embeddings generated from UniProt and Reactome may not be sufficient, requiring further textual analysis of biomedical text like PubMed, which is feasible within the timeframe of our project plan. n/a",xARA: ARA through Explainable AI,10330631,OT2TR003448,"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Communities', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Engineering', 'Familiarity', 'Industry', 'Information Resources', 'Information Retrieval', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Language', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Biology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Provider', 'PubMed', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Semantics', 'Software Engineering', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Technology Assessment', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Training', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'base', 'case-based', 'cheminformatics', 'computer science', 'experience', 'insight', 'prototype', 'response', 'syntax']",NCATS,TUFTS MEDICAL CENTER,OT2,2021,736476
"Knowledge-Based Biomedical Data Science Knowledge-based biomedical data science  In the previous funding period, we designed and constructed breakthrough methods for creating a semantically coherent and logically consistent knowledge-base by automatically transforming and integrating many biomedical databases, and by directly extracting information from the literature. Building on decades of work in biomedical ontology development, and exploiting the architectures supporting the Semantic Web, we have demonstrated methods that allow effective querying spanning any combination of data sources in purely biological terms, without the queries having to reflect anything about the structure or distribution of information among any of the sources. These methods are also capable of representing apparently conflicting information in a logically consistent manner, and tracking the provenance of all assertions in the knowledge-base. Perhaps the most important feature of these methods is that they scale to potentially include nearly all knowledge of molecular biology.  We now hypothesize that using these technologies we can build knowledge-bases with broad enough coverage to overcome the “brittleness” problems that stymied previous approaches to symbolic artificial intelligence, and then create novel computational methods which leverage that knowledge to provide critical new tools for the interpretation and analysis of biomedical data. To test this hypothesis, we propose to address the following specific aims:  1. Identify representative and significant analytical needs in knowledge-based data science, and  refine and extend our knowledge-base to address those needs in three distinct domains: clinical  pharmacology, cardiovascular disease and rare genetic disease.  2. Develop novel and implement existing symbolic, statistical, network-based, machine learning  and hybrid approaches to goal-driven inference from very large knowledge-bases. Create a goal-  directed framework for selecting and combining these inference methods to address particular  analytical problems.  3. Overcome barriers to broad external adoption of developed methods by analyzing their  computational complexity, optimizing performance of knowledge-based querying and inference,  developing simplified, biology-focused query languages, lightweight packaging of knowledge  resources and systems, and addressing issues of licensing and data redistribution.

"Image-guided Biocuration of Disease Pathways From Scientific Literature Realization of precision medicine ideas requires an unprecedented rapid pace of translation of biomedical discoveries into clinical practice. However, while many non-canonical disease pathways and uncommon drug actions, which are of vital importance for understanding individual patient-specific disease pathways, are accumulated in the literature, most are not organized in databases. Currently, such knowledge is curated manually or semi-automatically in a very limited scope. Meanwhile, the volume of biomedical information in PubMed (currently 28 million publications) keeps growing by more than a million articles per year, which demands more efficient and effective biocuration approaches.  To address this challenge, a novel biocuration method for automatic extraction of disease pathways from figures and text of biomedical articles will be developed.  Specific Aim 1: To develop focused benchmark sets of articles to assess the performance of the biocuration pipeline.  Specific Aim 2: To develop a method for extraction of components of disease pathways from articles’ figures based on deep-learning techniques.  Specific Aim 3: To develop a method for reconstruction of disease-specific pathways through enrichment and through graph neural network (GNN) approaches.  Specific Aim 4: To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the pipeline.  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a computer-based automatic biocuration ecosystem for rapid transformation of free-text biomedical literature into a machine-processable format for medical applications.  The overall impact of the proposed project will be to significantly improve health outcomes in individualized patient cases by efficiently bringing the latest biomedical discoveries into a precision medicine setting. It will especially benefit cancer patients for which up-to-date knowledge of newly discovered molecular mechanisms and drug actions is critical.

"Audio Generation and Optimization from Existing Resources for Patient Education Project Summary/Abstract Health literacy is vital to achieving and maintaining good health. Several national programs have emphasized this goal and its importance. Text is generally much more efficient and cost-effective for presenting healthcare information on a large scale than interactive tools and videos. Over the past decade, therefore, most medical information has been provided as text, e.g., via printed pamphlets or on websites. We are entering a new era where a new similarly effective mode of information dissemination is becoming increasingly available: audio accessed with mobile devices. Millions of households have and use smart speakers and virtual assistants and they are increasingly used by patients and consumers to gather information. Hospitals also plan to gradually integrate them among their tools. However, there exist few if any guidelines on optimal generation and use of audio. The overall goal of this project is to discover how to support the creation of optimal audio from existing text sources for consumer and patient education. To accomplish this, four aims are proposed. The first aim is to identify audio features that affect information comprehension and retention. Here, features in audio content and style (e.g., word frequency or grammatical complexity) of the underlying information will be tested for impact. In addition, two groups of features specific to the audio medium will be tested: the delivery features (e.g., speed and pauses) as well as meta-features (e.g., speaker characteristics such as gender or accent and bias in listeners). This first aim will rely on large-scale datasets, semi-automatically generated and augmented with user scores for comprehension gathered using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Statistical and machine learning approaches will be used to tease out the best features and combinations. The second aim focuses on discovering how to augment text for audio and finding the optimal combination of text and audio for information comprehension and retention. Different combinations will be tested online with MTurk participants using controlled user studies. The third aim is to update, test and provide the existing online free text editor to generate optimized audio. We will also start dissemination of the tool to potential users including API access to components. The project will conclude with a summative evaluation with representative consumers recruited at a local community health center and further dissemination of preferences, practical obstacles, and best practices for the medical community to help increase health literacy through this new, popular audio medium. If successful, this project will generate best practices for the medical community in using audio as an additional method for bringing healthcare information to the general public; it will provide an online, free tool to generate audio leveraging these best practices and will include API access so that other researchers can easily integrate tool components into their research and tools; and it will provide immediate practical lessons from working with consumers relevant for clinical practice. Project Narrative Improving health literacy is an important national goal and necessary for achieving and maintaining health. The increased adoption of smart speakers and virtual assistants by consumers and in medical settings has created novel opportunities to educate the population by delivering health information through audio or audio combined with text. Because few (if any) tools exist to improve content and generate optimal audio, we aim to discover supportive and adverse features of audio/text information provision and create a free, online software tool for optimizing health-related text with demonstrated impact on information comprehension and retention.",Audio Generation and Optimization from Existing Resources for Patient Education,10295641,R01LM011975,"['Accent', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Affordable Care Act', 'Age', 'Arizona', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Comprehension', 'Computer software', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Effectiveness', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'General Population', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Government', 'Growth', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitals', 'Household', 'Information Dissemination', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pamphlets', 'Participant', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Update', 'Voice', 'Work', 'Work Simplification', 'Writing', 'application programming interface', 'clinical encounter', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cost effective', 'design', 'digital', 'experience', 'handheld mobile device', 'health literacy', 'improved', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'intelligent personal assistant', 'interactive tool', 'large scale data', 'novel', 'open source', 'preference', 'programs', 'real world application', 'recruit', 'skills', 'statistical and machine learning', 'symposium', 'tool', 'web site']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,257905
"Breakthrough Molecular Dynamics Research via an Anton2 Supercomputer Project Summary In 2010, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) and D.E. Shaw Research (DESRES) partnered to make the Anton special-purpose molecular dynamics (MD) supercomputer available to the national biomedical research community for the first time. Anton enabled researchers to simulate biomolecular systems two orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer, allowing researchers access to critical multi- microsecond and longer timescales on which most biologically-significant molecular processes take place. In 2016, with operational support from NIH, DESRES made available a next generation Anton 2 system at PSC at no cost. This multimillion-dollar gift from DESRES, with NIH support, provided a unique opportunity for researchers to tackle even more groundbreaking biological questions by simulating systems as large as 700,000 atoms at a rate of multiple microseconds per day. The goal of this renewal project is to provide the national biomedical research community with continued access to this unique and powerful Anton 2 resource and to maximize the benefit of this resource to the community. Since 2010, PSC has supported 589 research projects conducted by 202 unique PIs on the Anton systems hosted at PSC. So far, these projects have resulted in 292 publications, many of which have had significant impact on their fields of research. These fields cover the entire spectrum of biomolecular processes that form the fundamental underpinnings of biology, including protein folding, ion channel selectivity and gating, membrane dynamics and organization, protein- ligand binding, and many others. Demand for Anton 2 is quite high, with 2-3x higher demand than can be met each year. Given this, our goals are focused not only on providing continued access but also on maximizing the value of this limited resource to the community—recognizing that the creativity of the broad, diverse Anton 2 research community is one of our most powerful resources for innovation. Anton 2 will be integrated as an XSEDE service provider, and the accessibility and impact of Anton 2 will significantly increase by engaging in their extensive broadening participation, outreach, and training programs. Through these outreach efforts, researchers at many more institutions will have the opportunity to use Anton 2, especially researchers from traditionally underrepresented groups in biomedical research. The hundreds of long-timescale MD trajectories researchers generate on Anton 2 constitute a unique and valuable dataset that can be used to gain additional biomedical knowledge and advance the application of machine learning protocols to augment molecular dynamics simulations. This important dataset will be available to researchers and educators worldwide through a web portal and co-located on the PSC's Bridges-2 system for classroom instruction and research, including reanalysis, machine learning, and data mining. Project Narrative The Anton 2 supercomputer made available at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center through this award will enable researchers to simulate biomolecular systems orders of magnitude faster than any conventional supercomputer. This powerful resource will enable biomedical researchers to better understand the fundamental biomolecular processes of biology, leading to better ways to treat disease and improve quality of life.",Breakthrough Molecular Dynamics Research via an Anton2 Supercomputer,10211715,R01GM116961,"['Academy', 'Area', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community Health Education', 'Creativeness', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'Evaluation Reports', 'FAIR principles', 'Funding', 'Gifts', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Institution', 'Instruction', 'Ion Channel', 'Knowledge', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Molecular', 'National Research Council', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Quality of life', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Research Support', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Science', 'Secure', 'Supercomputing', 'System', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'Underrepresented Populations', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'anxious', 'archive data', 'archived data', 'base', 'broadening participation research', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data management', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'improved', 'innovation', 'molecular dynamics', 'next generation', 'outreach', 'outreach program', 'price lists', 'protein folding', 'service providers', 'supercomputer', 'uptake', 'web portal']",NIGMS,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,408856
