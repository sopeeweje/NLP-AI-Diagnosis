"Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident Summary Following a large scale radiological or nuclear event, hundreds of thousands of people may be exposed to ionizing radiation/s and require subsequent dose-dependent medical management. It will be crucial to collect and analyze human biofluids (such as blood, urine, saliva) as soon as possible within the first week for accurate dose prediction and early triage decision. There is a need for FDA-approved in vitro diagnostic high-throughput biodosimetry devices with the ability to determine past radiation exposure with precision and accuracy. At the Center for High Throughput Radiation Biodosimetry, the Columbia University Center for Medical Countermeasures against Radiation (CMCR), we have developed FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system, to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human peripheral blood samples for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. The protein panel also includes biomarkers for blood leukocyte subtypes to reflect hematological sensitivity and injury. The FAST- DOSE assay system is intended as an in vitro diagnostic device (IVD) as defined by 21 CFR 809.3. The platform uses a commercial imaging flow cytometry system (ImageStream®X) and associated Image Data Exploration and Analysis Software (IDEAS®) to rapidly quantify changes in biomarker expression levels within specific cellular structures using fluorescent imagery and algorithms for estimation of absorbed dose. The studies planned here are designed to develop and optimize our FAST-DOSE assay system to accurately estimate absorbed dose and assess hematopoietic injury in human lymphocytes after ionizing irradiation. The first objective is to build on our current biomarker validation data for early engagement with the FDA via the pre-submission process. We have used the human ex vivo model and humanized mouse (Hu-NSG) and non- human primate (NHP) models to validate biomarker expression and radiosensitivity in blood leukocytes after acute ionizing radiation exposure. The Specific Aims proposed here are designed to: optimize the assay protocol and identify biomarker dose/time kinetics for accurate dose predictions in vitro and test 1) inter-donor variation, 2) intra-donor variation and 3) inter-laboratory variability (Aim 1); test the effect of specific confounders: age and sex, inheritance with germline BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, and inflammation and trauma on the biomarker response, before and after irradiation (Aim 2); measure biomarker levels and time kinetics in vivo and correlate with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts, and stem and progenitor cell levels in the bone marrow of Hu-NSG mice (Aim 3) and, develop mathematical models (using machine learning and regression techniques) to select the best FAST-DOSE biomarkers and their combinations for generating dose predictions based on the ex vivo and in vivo dose response of these biomarkers (Aim 4). Our vision for future development is to develop a more simplified, faster rapid FAST-DOSE assay system whereby the biomarkers could be developed and transitioned for use in a point-of-care (POC) device. NARRATIVE We have developed a high-throughput biodosimetry device, the FAST-DOSE (Fluorescent Automated Screening Tool for Dosimetry) assay system to measure radiation-responsive proteins in human blood leukocytes for retrospective estimation of radiation dose. Studies are designed to validate and test the performance of the blood protein biomarker panel to accurately predict absorbed dose after ionizing radiation exposure. We will correlate biomarker expression levels and time kinetics with hematopoietic injury, based on peripheral blood leukocyte counts and bone marrow toxicity in humanized mice.","Development of FAST-DOSE assay system for the rapid assessment of acute radiation exposure, individual radiosensitivity and injury in victims for a large-scale radiological incident",10089406,U01AI148309,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Acute', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'BRCA1 gene', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Proteins', 'Blood specimen', 'Bone Marrow', 'Burn injury', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cellular Structures', 'Computer software', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Dose', 'Exposure to', 'FDA approved', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoietic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Immune', 'Immunoassay', 'Individual', 'Industrial Accidents', 'Inflammation', 'Inherited', 'Injury', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Ions', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Leukocytes', 'Linear Regressions', 'Lymphocyte', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Screening', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Modeling', 'Mus', 'Noise', 'Nuclear Accidents', 'Pathogenicity', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Accidents', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Saliva', 'Screening procedure', 'Seeds', 'Surface Antigens', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Trauma', 'Triage', 'Uncertainty', 'Urine', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'White Blood Cell Count procedure', 'base', 'biodosimetry', 'biomarker panel', 'biomarker performance', 'biomarker validation', 'blood damage', 'data exploration', 'design', 'dirty bomb', 'dosimetry', 'humanized mouse', 'in vitro testing', 'in vivo', 'in-vitro diagnostics', 'irradiation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'medical countermeasure', 'micronucleus', 'nonhuman primate', 'nonlinear regression', 'performance tests', 'peripheral blood', 'point of care', 'predicting response', 'predictive modeling', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'sex', 'stem', 'stem cells']",NIAID,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,U01,2021,483863

"Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans Project Summary/Abstract Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (PET/CT) using the radiolabeled tracer 2- deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has become a standard imaging tool for cancer patient management. The semi-quantitative parameter standardized uptake value (SUV) is routinely used in clinical for tumor uptake quantification, which is computed on the static PET image acquired at a certain time (typically 60 min) post tracer injection for a short interval (typically 5-15 min). However, the quantification accuracy of SUV from a single PET scan suffers from the variabilities of tracer plasma clearance and acquisition start time. The dual- time-point FDG PET imaging has been intensively investigated and used in both clinical and research studies, typically one scan at 60 min and the other at 120 min, showing the potential to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of FDG PET by differentiating malignancy from inflammation and normal tissue. However, the current clinical dual-time-point FDG PET studies use the relative SUV change between two scans as the quantification index, which cannot eliminate the variations in tracer plasma clearance. Meanwhile, the dual-time-point protocol has not been optimized and standardized currently, leading to conflicting results. The fully-quantitative parameter, tracer net uptake rate constant Ki, is the most accurate parameter to quantify FDG PET, which is calculated using dynamic imaging with compartmental modeling. Ki is independent on the plasma clearance or acquisition start time. However, the long and complex acquisition protocol (typically at least 60 min), which requires dynamic scanning and sequential arterial blood sampling (or image-derived blood activity) used as input function from the time of injection, limits its application in clinical practice. Meanwhile, generation of the parametric Ki image, which can provide additional heterogeneity information for FDG PET, is challenging clinically using voxel-by-voxel compartmental modeling due to the computational cost and being sensitive to noise using non-linear least squares. The graphical Patlak plot, can be used for simplified Ki calculation and Ki image generation by voxel-by-voxel fitting. However, it still needs dynamic scanning starting from 15-30 min after injection and input function from the time of injection. The aims of this proposal are 1) to optimize the dual-time-point protocol for accurate Ki quantification using Patlak plot without the need for individual patient's input function, and 2) to generate high-quality low-noise dual-time-point Ki images using novel techniques based on deep learning. Upon the success of this project, our proposed approach can obtain reliable tumor Ki quantification and parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual- time-point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology. We expect the translation of this approach to clinical investigation to be fast, as this is a post-processing approach and is based on data already acquired using clinically used protocol without imposing additional burden to technologists. Project Narrative For FDG PET imaging, we propose to develop a novel and simple approach of quantifying tumor Ki and generating parametric Ki image ""for free"" without adding any additional complexity on the existing dual-time- point protocol currently used in clinical practice, with great potential of improving diagnosis and therapy assessment in oncology.",Generation of parametric images for FDG PET using dual-time-point scans,10117077,R03EB027864,"['Blood', 'Blood specimen', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Generations', 'Glucose', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Inflammation', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Noise', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Plasma', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiolabeled', 'Scanning', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Variant', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'clinical practice', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'novel', 'parametric imaging', 'population based', 'research study', 'simulation', 'success', 'tumor', 'uptake']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R03,2021,83750
"Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT With the introduction of many novel techniques to minimize radiation dose in CT, there is still a large variation in terms of radiation dose levels prescribed in CT exams and therefore a large variation of diagnostic performance. Some patients may receive higher dose than necessary. Some may be under-dosed and mis- diagnosed as a result of insufficient image quality. In order to determine the appropriate amount of radiation dose reduction in each exam, accurate quantification of diagnostic performance is needed so that the dose reduction can be achieved without sacrificing important diagnostic information. However, currently there is a lack of efficient and quantitative tools for objective assessment of diagnostic performance, particularly for many of the novel dose reduction methods involving non-linear processing of the data such as iterative reconstruction and deep-learning-based noise reduction methods. The specific goal of this application is to disseminate a highly automated solution, CT Protocol optimization (CTPro) software, to a wide CT community. This quantitative tool provides an efficient implementation of diagnostic performance assessment and CT radiation dose optimization. This tool is based on channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which itself was developed decades ago to mimic human observer visual responses in signal detection tasks. However, the use of CHO in clinical CT is quite limited because of a lack of rigorous validation and efficient and robust implementation in practice. We were the first to demonstrate its correlation with human observer performance in low-contrast detection, classification and localization tasks in clinical CT. The main objective of the current proposal is to optimize this tool for simplicity and robustness, and disseminate it to CT researchers and clinical users, which will be accomplished through 3 specific aims: Aim 1: Optimize CTPro for simplicity, robustness, and generalizability. Aim 2: Develop an open-source web-based platform for software dissemination. Aim 3: Build use cases and disseminate CTPro. The proposed work is significant because the software tool will allow any CT users and researchers to perform CT radiation dose optimization and diagnostic performance evaluation in an efficient, quantitative, and objective manner. This work is innovative in that the automated tool will use quantitative measures of diagnostic performance to systematically guide the complex task of CT dose optimization, moving beyond traditional metrics that are inappropriate for many novel dose reduction techniques. The software tool, once widely employed, will facilitate a paradigm shift in how dose optimization and the evaluation of dose reduction techniques are performed, and will allow a more rapid and consistent adoption of dose reduction technology into clinical practice, which will benefit millions of CT patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE There has been a lack of quantitative tools for efficient and objective assessment of diagnostic performance in CT, which is the reason why inappropriate radiation dose is frequently used in CT exams, resulting in unnecessarily high radiation exposure to patients or lose of important diagnostic information. The purpose of this project is to disseminate a highly automated solution to a wide CT community for efficient CT radiation dose optimization. If successful, appropriate amount of radiation can be prescribed for millions of CT patients at any facility, while maintaining the level of diagnostic information required for high quality patient care.",Dissemination of a Software Platform for Efficient CT Radiation Dose Optimization and Diagnostic Performance Assessment,10187567,U24EB028936,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Educational workshop', 'Electronic Mail', 'Encapsulated', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Newsletter', 'Noise', 'Online Systems', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publications', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation exposure', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'computerized data processing', 'deep learning', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'open source', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'symposium', 'tool', 'validation studies', 'web site']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,U24,2021,310796
"Functional Lung Imaging Using a Single kV CT Acquisition ABSTRACT Venous thromboembolism is a major global health and economic burden with about 10 million cases occurring every year, and a high lifetime risk of 8% after age 45 years. Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a venous thromboembolic event associated with high morbidity and mortality, with about 20% incidence of death before diagnosis or shortly thereafter. Most recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a marked increase in patients presenting with acute pulmonary thromboembolic disease, most likely created when the infectious vasculitis involving the endothelium creates local arterial thrombosis and subsequent lung infarction, with a superimpose hypercoagulable state that promotes clot formation. In these patients, it is increasingly being recognized that pulmonary perfusion abnormalities associated with the lung consolidations and ground-glass opacities are important predictors of poor prognosis. Currently, pulmonary CT angiography (CTA) has become the preferred method for diagnosing PE and planar lung ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scintigraphy is used in cases when pulmonary CTA is contraindicated. A compelling unmet clinical need is to develop a method for simultaneous pulmonary CTA and parenchymal perfusion assessment without the use of two modalities like CTA and SPECT perfusion in the same patient. In this project, an imaging physics-based deep learning method will be developed to extract the previously overlooked spectral information inherently encoded in the acquired contrast enhanced CT projection data. As a result of this breakthrough, this new spectral CT imaging method, referred to as Deep-En-Chroma, will be developed and validated for perfusion defect quantification in lung parenchyma from the currently available pulmonary CTA. This will be accomplished without the need for any expensive dual energy CT (DECT) hardware upgrades that have been commercialized by major CT manufacturers. In summary, upon the completion of this project, a new functional CT imaging method will have been developed, that in addition to providing the currently available pulmonary CTA images, will also detect perfusion defects in lung parenchyma without the requirement of high-end DECT hardware.

"Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning The accuracy of radiation treatment planning (RTP) heavily influences the effectiveness of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). Individualized RTP begins with a “simulation”, in which the patient in a treatment position is commonly scanned using computed tomography (CT) to define the treatment target and organs at risk (OARs). When soft-tissue contrast is inadequate to support accurate target and OAR delineation in CT based RTP, conservatively large treatment margins are used to avoid a geometric miss. The crude treatment prevents delivering sufficient radiation dose to the tumor without exceeding the tolerance of surrounding normal tissues. Magnetic resonance (MR) can be used as a simulation platform complementary to CT for improved soft-tissue conspicuity. Yet, such a complicated, costly and tedious multi-modal RTP workflow along with unavoidable systematic MR-CT co-registration errors has limited its applications in EBRT, especially at the abdominal site whereby anatomies are highly mobile. Over the past few years, there is a keen interest in the integration of MR alone into RTP and even the therapy workflow (i.e. MR-guided radiotherapy, MRgRT). The abdomen poses critical challenges to MR simulation. Current MR imaging sequences are suboptimal to produce motion-free images and resolve respiratory motion. MR data processing for abdominal RTP is underdeveloped. Contouring of target and OARs typically relies on manual, tedious procedures that are time-consuming and variation-prone. In this proposal, we will substantially improve the MR acquisition and automated multi-organ segmentation, so the potential of MR as a simulation modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal EBRT. Three specific aims will be completed. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a standalone multi-task MR (MT-MR) sequence dedicated to abdominal MR simulation. In Aim 2, we will develop an MT-MR simulation based multi-organ auto- segmentation tool. In Aim 3, we will optimize a deep learning-based dose prediction model and assess the effectiveness of the MT-MR based RTP workflow in adaptive stereotactic body radiotherapy planning of pancreatic cancer patients. Successful completion of the project will significantly promote the clinical adoption of MR simulation for abdominal RTP, which will improve treatment precision and outcomes. Moreover, the developed techniques will open the door to future studies aiming at optimizations in both cancer diagnosis and radiotherapy. Imaging is essential for precise radiation treatment planning. MR based planning is challenging in the abdomen whereby anatomies are highly mobile. We will substantially improve the MR acquisition and automated multi- organ segmentation, so the potential of MR as an imaging-based planning modality can be fully unleashed for abdominal radiation treatment.",Multi-Task MR Simulation for Abdominal Radiation Treatment Planning,10331615,R01EB029088,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Anatomy', 'Breathing', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Future', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Motion', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pancreas', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Solid', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Study Subject', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'Water', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'experience', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'novel', 'pancreatic cancer patients', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'standard of care', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,507076
"Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion Project Summary/Abstract X-ray computed tomography (CT) has been increasingly used in medical diagnosis, currently reaching more than 100 million CT scans every year in the US. The increasing use of CT has sparked concern over the effects of radiation dose on patients. It is estimated that every 2000 CT scans will cause one future cancer, i.e., 50,000 cases of future cancers from 100 million CT scans every year. CT brain perfusion (CTP) is a widely used imaging technique for the evaluation of hemodynamic changes in stroke and cerebrovascular disorders. However, CTP involves high radiation dose for patients as the CTP scan is repeated on the order of 40 times at the same anatomical location, in order to capture the full passage of the contrast bolus. Several techniques have been applied for radiation dose reduction in CTP scans, including reduction of tube current and tube voltage, as well as the use of noise reduction techniques such as iterative reconstruction (IR). However, the resultant radiation dose of existing CTP scans is still significantly higher than that of a standard head CT scan. The application of IR techniques in CTP is very limited due to the high complexity and computational burden for processing multiple CTP images that impairs clinical workflow. During the Phase 1 STTR project, we introduced a novel low dose CTP imaging method based on the k-space weighted image contrast (KWIC) reconstruction algorithm. We performed thorough evaluation in both a CTP phantom and clinical CTP datasets, and demonstrated that the KWIC algorithm is able to reduce the radiation dose of existing CTP techniques by 75% without affecting the image quality and accuracy of quantification (i.e., Milestone of Phase 1 STTR). However, the original KWIC algorithm requires rapid-switching pulsed X-ray at pre-specified rotation angles – a hardware capability yet to be implemented by commercial CT vendors. In order to address this limitation, we recently introduced a variant of the KWIC algorithm termed k-space weighted image average (KWIA) that preserves high spatial and temporal resolutions as well as image quality of low dose CTP data (~75% dose reduction) to be comparable to those of standard CTP scans. Most importantly, KWIA does not require modification of existing CT hardware and is computationally simple and fast, therefore has a low barrier for market penetration. The purpose of the Phase 2 STTR project is to further optimize and validate the KWIA algorithm for reducing radiation dose of CTP scans by ~75% while preserving the image quality and quantification accuracy in CTP phantom, clinical CTP data and animal studies. We will further develop innovative deep-learning (DL) based algorithms to address potential motion and other artifacts in KWIA, and commercialize the developed algorithms by collaborating with CT vendors. Relevance to Public Health More than 100 million CT scans are performed every year in the US, estimated to cause 50,000 cases of future cancers. This project will develop, evaluate and commercialize novel CT imaging technologies that reduce the radiation dose of existing CT perfusion techniques by ~75% without compromising imaging speed or quality.",Novel Algorithms for Reducing Radiation Dose of CT Perfusion,10220967,R44EB024438,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American Heart Association', 'Anatomy', 'Angiography', 'Animals', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Head', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Infarction', 'Location', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modification', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Small Business Technology Transfer Research', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Speed', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Tube', 'Variant', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'acute stroke', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'contrast imaging', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'hemodynamics', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'low dose computed tomography', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'preservation', 'radiation effect', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'voltage']",NIBIB,"HURA IMAGING, INC",R44,2021,821583
"FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring Project Abstract/Summary Ultra-low dose CT, defined as sub-millisievert (sub-mSv) imaging of the entire chest, abdomen or pelvis, is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, photon starvation and electronic noise make imaging at such dose levels challenging. Photon starvation refers to the number of transmitted photons. When no photons are transmitted, the measurement is essentially useless. If few photons are transmitted, the measurement carries information, but its interpretation and value are confounded by electronic noise. Solutions with encouraging results have been offered for sub-mSv chest imaging, but these are not widely available and not easily generalizable across anatomical sites, vendors and scanner models. We propose a novel, robust solution for ultra-low dose CT that will overcome these issues. We refer to our solution as FAIR-CT, which stands for Finite-Angle Integrated-Ray CT. FAIR-CT operates under the principle that photon starvation and the confounding effect of electronic noise are best handled by avoiding them, which is made possible by increasing the data integration time during the source-detector rotation. FAIR-CT data strongly deviate from the classical CT data model and share the streak artifact problem of sparse view sampling. FAIR-CT data acquisition also affects azimuthal resolution. We anticipate that these issues can be suitably handled using advanced image reconstruction techniques. Once available, FAIR-CT will allow improvements in longitudinal monitoring of patients with chronic diseases such as COPD, urolithiasis and diabetes, thereby reducing mortality and co-morbidities. FAIR-CT will also allow advancing cancer therapy treatments by enabling adjustments in radiation therapy plans between dose fractions without increasing CT radiation exposure, and by facilitating early detection of inflammations in drug-based therapies. To bring FAIR-CT towards fruition, we will work on two specific aims: (1) Creation of a comprehensive collection of FAIR-CT data sets enabling rigorous development, validation and evaluation of image reconstruction algorithms; (2) Development, validation and evaluation of advanced image reconstruction algorithms. The FAIR-CT data sets will involve the utilization of state-of-the-art scanners and include real patient data synthesized from high dose scans acquired for standard of care. Two complementary image reconstruction approaches will be investigated. Namely, model-based iterative reconstruction with non-linear forward model and dedicated compressed sensing regularization; and deep learning-based refinement of FBP reconstructions using target images with task-adapted image quality. Image quality evaluation will account for critical biological variables and involve objective metrics such as structure similarity and contrast-to-noise ratio for clinically-proven lesions, as well as task-based performance metrics involving human readers. Ultra-low dose X-ray computed tomography is critically needed for healthcare of patients with chronic diseases and cancer. Unfortunately, physics-related challenges and impractical solutions make this concept unavailable for everyday clinical use. We will develop a novel solution that is practical and can quickly be brought to clinical practice.",FAIR-CT: a practical approach to enable ultra-low dose CT for longitudinal disease and treatment monitoring,10158473,R21EB029179,"['Abdomen', 'Academia', 'Advanced Malignant Neoplasm', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Body mass index', 'Chest', 'Chronic Disease', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Computers', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Epidemic', 'Evaluation', 'Fruit', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Industry', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Lesion', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Noise', 'Obesity', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Process', 'Pulmonary Inflammation', 'Radiation exposure', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Starvation', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'comorbidity', 'data acquisition', 'data integration', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'expectation', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'low dose computed tomography', 'mortality', 'novel', 'reconstruction', 'sex', 'side effect', 'standard of care', 'targeted imaging', 'urolithiasis']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R21,2021,227282
"Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the main cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Cardiac CT provides fast non-invasive assessment of CAD with a high sensitivity and negative predictive value – provided that the lumen can be visualized. However, heavily calcified or stented coronary segments are non- assessable, precluding non-invasive diagnosis of flow-limiting coronary plaques in an estimated 2 million U.S. adults. In addition, the spatial resolution of state-of-the-art CT systems is insufficient for robust visualization of features associated with high risk plaques. Further, while CT can quantitatively evaluate the impact of obstructive CAD on myocardial function using dynamic perfusion imaging, this requires relatively high patient radiation doses, which has limited widespread adoption. Considering the high personal and societal cost of CAD, robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam is critically needed. Built by Siemens Healthcare, a first-of-its-kind, whole-body, photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT system was installed in 2014 at the Mayo Clinic. With support from NIH award EB016966, we showed that the increased iodine contrast-to-noise ratio, decreased electronic noise, spectral imaging capabilities, and improved spatial resolution of PCD-CT relative to commercial CT enabled us to accurately measure increased vasa vasorum density in injured swine carotid arterial walls, demonstrating the exceptional potential of PCD-CT in vascular imaging. Because this system lacks cardiac imaging capabilities, our objective is to develop and validate a PCD dual-source (DS) CT system and novel imaging algorithms to accurately assess CAD in humans, especially in patients with heavily calcified, stented, or high-risk plaques, and to identify patients with myocardial perfusion defects. Our premise is that the established benefits of PCD-CT, used with a DS geometry and advanced noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms, can meet these objectives. Our proposal is significant in many ways: the technology developments will benefit all of CT imaging; robust, accurate, non-invasive imaging of calcified and stented coronary arteries, high-risk plaque features, and myocardial perfusion defects in a single, low-radiation-dose exam will obviate the need for additional imaging, reducing the overall time and cost to comprehensively evaluate CAD and its clinical significance. To extend the demonstrated benefits of PCDs to cardiac CT will require numerous physics, engineering, and algorithm innovations, including novel noise reduction and material decomposition algorithms using energy, spatial and temporal domain redundancies, as well as deep learning. These advances will culminate in a large clinical study to demonstrate not merely that the images are “better,” as is so often done, but that PCD-DSCT provides clinically-significant improvements in the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected CAD. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will develop a new type of cardiac computed tomography (CT) scanner that is able to comprehensively assess coronary artery disease in humans. This technology, known as photon-counting- detector dual-source CT, is capable of exceptional spatial and temporal resolution, multi-energy spectral imaging and reduced radiation doses, allowing it to image the coronary artery and myocardium with unparalleled quality. This will enable comprehensive assessment of coronary artery anatomy and myocardial function from a single imaging exam, reducing time to diagnosis and cost, while also improving patient diagnosis and management.",Comprehensive characterization of coronary atherosclerotic disease using photon-counting-detector dual-source CT and its impact on patient management,10150846,R01EB028590,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cardiac', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collaborations', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Contrast Media', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary artery', 'Defect', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Engineering', 'Equipment', 'Family suidae', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heart failure', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Iodine', 'Lesion', 'Low Dose Radiation', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Predictive Value', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stents', 'Sudden Death', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Translating', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'algorithm development', 'calcification', 'clinically significant', 'coronary plaque', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'detector', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'high risk', 'human subject', 'imaging capabilities', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'injured', 'innovation', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'photon-counting detector', 'routine practice', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'societal costs', 'spectral energy', 'spectrograph', 'technology development', 'temporal measurement', 'vasa vasorum']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,657862
"Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers ABSTRACT  Gynecologic cancers are among the leading causes of cancer death in women worldwide. These patients typically are socioeconomically disadvantaged, with poor access to screening and vaccination. Consequently, they often present with locoregionally advanced disease, for which pelvic radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent cisplatin (i.e., chemoradiotherapy) is the standard of care. This treatment is limited, however, by high rates of treatment failure. Intensifying treatment through the delivery of chemotherapy doublets, either concurrently or as adjuvant therapy following chemoradiotherapy, is a promising strategy to improve outcomes. However, the delivery of intensive chemotherapy is complicated by high rates of gastrointestinal and hematologic toxicity. Strategies to reduce toxicity while increasing efficacy of chemoradiotherapy are needed.  Standard pelvic RT techniques encompass large volumes of normal tissue including bowel, bone marrow, bone, bladder, and rectum, leading to preventable radiation-induced toxicity. Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) can improve target localization and dosimetry, optimizing target dose while minimizing dose to surrounding normal tissues. However, IGRT can be highly resource intensive, and comparative effectiveness trials have been lacking. For this reason, there is considerable controversy as to the utility of IG-IMRT in this disease. Our research group has been at the forefront of developing novel, cost-effective IGRT approaches with wide potential to facilitate better delivery of concurrent and/or adjuvant chemotherapy.  Previously we have found that radiation-induced injury to hematopoietically active bone marrow is a critical determinant of tolerance to intensive chemotherapy. Using machine learning methods, we recently developed a multi-atlas-based IGRT method that can predict canonical distributions of active bone marrow, which can obviate the need for positron emission tomography (PET) in settings where this technology is unavailable or unaffordable. The proposed new research will study the ability of multi-atlas-based IGRT to reduce hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to standard treatment, using data from 450 patients enrolled to a randomized phase III trial (NRG-GY006). Furthermore, we will use serial whole body PET/CT to study the impact of radiation dose and chemotherapy intensity on the compensatory hematopoietic response, and have developed novel whole body radiomics biomarkers to quantify the inflammatory state, which we hypothesize can influence patients' outcomes and tolerance to chemotherapy.  The new research extends our work associated with a current R01 grant (1R01CA197059-01) to conduct correlative science associated with the GY006 trial. The overarching goal of this research line is to augment the therapeutic ratio of chemoradiotherapy for pelvic cancers using advanced image-guided radiation techniques. If successful, this research would significantly alter the approach to the treatment of many pelvic malignancies for which chemoradiotherapy is standard. PROJECT NARRATIVE In this study, we will test the ability of a novel method called multi-atlas-based image guided radiation therapy (IGRT) to reduce acute hematologic toxicity and improve chemotherapy delivery compared to conventional RT, which could obviate the need for expensive functional imaging in socioeconomically disadvantaged and resource constrained populations, such as patients with gynecologic cancers. In addition, we will use serial positron emission tomography to study effects of chemotherapy and radiation on the subacute compensatory hematopoietic response, and will seek to develop and validate novel whole body radiomics models of the inflammatory state as predictive biomarkers for gynecologic cancers. We are in an optimal situation to conduct impactful and innovative research in the context of an ongoing phase III cooperative group randomized registration trial (NRG GY006), affording us the opportunity to conduct rigorous correlative science on a large sample with high data quality, quality assurance, and carefully controlled treatment effects.",Multi-atlas and whole body radiomics approaches for image-guided treatment of gynecologic cancers,10108128,R01CA255780,"['Acute', 'Adjuvant Chemotherapy', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Aftercare', 'Aging', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Cisplatin', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Hematology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Intensity-Modulated Radiotherapy', 'Intestines', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neck', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Cancer', 'Pelvis', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment outcome', 'Triapine', 'Vaccination', 'Woman', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'bone', 'chemoradiation', 'chemotherapy', 'comparative effectiveness trial', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'data quality', 'dosimetry', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'gastrointestinal', 'image guided', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image-guided radiation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'phase III trial', 'predictive marker', 'quality assurance', 'radiation-induced injury', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'response', 'screening', 'socioeconomic disadvantage', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'trial design', 'whole body imaging']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R01,2021,276286
"Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer Project Summary Despite the advent of aggressive cervical cancer screening programs, cervical cancer remains one of the most common cancers affecting women under age 35, and the fourth most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The standard of care for early stage (≥IB) cervical cancer is hysterectomy or radiation. Unfortunately, the consequences of radical treatment include fertility loss, nerve injury causing bladder and bowel dysfunction, and pelvic pain. There is a critical need to reduce cervical cancer mortality, while minimizing the potential morbidities of treatment. To achieve this end requires refined approaches for diagnosis and evaluation of response to treatment using noninvasive biomarkers to differentiate indolent from clinically significant disease at the earliest possible time-point. PET/CT is currently the mainstay in evaluating response to treatment and is highly confounded by post-treatment changes such as edema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with advanced diffusion-weighted imaging may offer an alternative approach to evaluate treatment response, with additional advantages of being a radiation-free and contrast media-free exam. The overall objective in this application is to develop and evaluate a robust advanced diffusion-weighted imaging technique that provides a highly sensitive and specific reflection of cervical cancer tumor burden and treatment response at the earliest possible time point. Our hypothesis is that restriction spectrum imaging (RSI), an advanced diffusion imaging technique, is as sensitive and specific as standard of care post-treatment PET/CT for evaluation of treatment efficacy of cervical cancer and can be performed 3 months earlier than standard of care PET/CT. The aims of this proposal are 1) Determine the RSI model for cervical cancer evaluation, 2) Develop and validate a cervical cancer classification algorithm from multi-parametric MRI based on the Aim 1 biophysical model using established machine learning techniques, 3) Prospectively validate RSI-MRI compared to PET/CT in evaluating response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer patients (≥ stage IB) in a pilot study0. The main significance of this study is the development of a radiation-free and non-contrast imaging technique for evaluating response to treatment three months earlier than the current standard of care PET/CT. This will allow appropriate treatment earlier preventing unnecessary progression of disease. The innovation proposed involves developing a diffusion model specific for cervix imaging within the RSI framework based on the biophysical characteristics of healthy and malignant cervical tissue. We will then apply this quantitative technique prospectively on a preliminary cohort of patients before and after treatment and compare to the standard of care PET/CT imaging. At the completion of the study, a new tool for evaluating response to treatment in cervical cancer that is contrast and radiation free will be available. This is directly translatable to the clinical setting to benefit cervical cancer patients. Cervical cancer patients will be better served, particularly patients not responding to treatment, as they can be directed to appropriate treatment at an earlier time point. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because cervical cancer is a common cause of cancer amongst women and treatment decisions are based heavily on accurate and early imaging. By developing a technique that evaluates response to treatment earlier than the current standard of care, we will decrease morbidity and mortality by treating cervical cancer at an earlier time point, preventing further progression of disease. The development of new biomedical imaging techniques to fundamentally improve the detection and treatment of disease is directly relevant to one of the key missions of the NIH.",Advanced diffusion MRI for evaluating early response to radiation treatment in cervical cancer,10121726,R37CA249659,"['Access to Information', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Benign', 'Biological Markers', 'Bladder', 'Brain', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cervical', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cervix Uteri', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early treatment', 'Edema', 'Evaluation', 'Free Will', 'Functional disorder', 'Gold', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hysterectomy', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Indolent', 'Infertility', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pelvic Pain', 'Performance', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reader', 'Research', 'Restriction Spectrum Imaging', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Burden', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Water', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'biophysical model', 'biophysical properties', 'cancer imaging', 'chemoradiation', 'classification algorithm', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'diagnosis evaluation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic field', 'mortality', 'nerve injury', 'novel strategies', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'radiation response', 'radical hysterectomy', 'response', 'screening program', 'standard of care', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'uptake', 'water diffusion']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R37,2021,640083
"Cardiac photon counting CT and its application in studying interactions between Alzheimer's and heart disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Aging is accompanied by increasing vulnerability to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The ongoing rise in both AD and CVD has been ascribed to the increasing adoption of a Western sedentary lifestyle accompanied by a diet rich in fats and sugars. To understand the links between AD and CVD in human subjects, non-invasive imaging methods such X-ray computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) are essential. Cardiac CT is one of the most powerful applications of these methodologies at both clinical and preclinical levels, but it is currently limited by its low contrast resolution. Our primary objective in this proposal is to improve the current status of cardiac CT based on photon counting detector technology and demonstrate its capabilities in preclinical studies focused on studying the interaction between CVD and AD. Our central hypothesis is that cardiac photon counting CT will provide low dose spectral characterization of atherosclerotic plaques together with cardiac function, while enabling longitudinal monitoring of interventions such as exercise. We will pursue three specific aims. In specific aim 1, we will develop the theoretical foundation and GPU optimized tools for reconstruction of cardiac 5D (3D + Time + Energy) photon counting CT data. We will incorporate deep learning solutions to overcome fundamental barriers to the advancement of this technology: regularization to deal with image noise associated with photon binning, robust material decomposition to combat spectral distortion, and automated cardiac function and plaque analysis to handle data dimensionality. During the second specific aim, we will characterize the performance of our novel cardiac photon counting CT imaging using simulations, phantoms and animal experiments to show its benefits for atherosclerotic plaque characterization and cardiac function estimation. Finally, in specific aim 3 we will investigate if cardiovascular risk impacts brain phenotypes in animal models of genetic risk for AD. CVD and AD share a genetic link via the ApoE gene and its isomorphic allele 4 (APOE4). We will use APOE3/HN and APOE4/HN mouse strains that express the corresponding specific targeted-replacement human APOE allele, on a humanized Nitric Oxide Synthase 2 (denoted here as HN) background. Using these models, we will first assess the impact of a high fat, high sugar diet on cardiovascular phenotypes (atherosclerotic plaque size, numbers; cardiac function measured with CT) and how these genetic differences are reflected in behavior and brain MR based biomarkers compared with control mice in the same background. Finally, we will also investigate the potential to rescue these phenotypes using exercise as the intervention. The impact of the proposed research will validate the usage of photon counting CT technology to enhance routine cardiac CT imaging applications. Our project will enable new powerful integrative approaches to examine the impact of environmental stressors to alter APOE genotype- specific vulnerability, or resilience to CVD and AD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Clinical, pathological and epidemiological evidence clearly show overlap between cardiovascular and Alzheimer’s diseases caused by a critical genetic link: the apolipoprotein E gene. We will develop novel photon counting cardiac CT imaging and use it in combination with brain MR imaging and behavior assessments to study the impact of APOE genotype in mouse models and to provide data on phenotypic differences in these mice when exposed to a high fat/high sugar diet and the role of exercise in protecting against Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular diseases.",Cardiac photon counting CT and its application in studying interactions between Alzheimer's and heart disease,10094804,RF1AG070149,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animal Model', 'Apolipoprotein E', 'Arterial Fatty Streak', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cause of Death', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Marker', 'Dose', 'Environmental Impact', 'Epidemiology', 'Exercise', 'Exposure to', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Heart Diseases', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immune response', 'Impaired cognition', 'Intervention', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mouse Strains', 'Mus', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'NOS2A gene', 'Names', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'behavioral study', 'cardiac plaque', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'combat', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'environmental stressor', 'exercise intervention', 'exercise regimen', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'mouse model', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical imaging', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'resilience', 'response', 'sedentary lifestyle', 'simulation', 'spectral distortion', 'sugar', 'tool']",NIA,DUKE UNIVERSITY,RF1,2021,1873076
"Correcting [18]F-Misonidazole PET with MRI and EPR to improve hypoxia-guided radiation therapy Project Summary  In this project, we propose to correct [18]F-Misonidazole (FMISO) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images to make PET be more accurate in measuring hypoxia. Hypoxia - a deficiency in oxygen - is a strong promotor of tumor radioresistance, yet there are no established clinical methods to accurately image oxygenation in vivo to improve treatment. Preclinical studies that acquired pO2 measurements using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging have shown that targeting hypoxic tumor sub-regions with a boost of TCD95 after irradiating the whole tumor with TCD15, significantly increased tumor control when compared to the boosting normoxic tumor sub-regions with TCD95. So far this has been demonstrated in fibrosarcoma (p = 0.04) and mammary carcinoma (p = 0.013) tumor types. This shows that if hypoxic tumor sub-regions can be accurately imaged and targeted with a boosted dose – better known as dose painting – the overall dose deposition to surrounding healthy tissues can be decreased while improving tumor control.  In recent years, clinical trials have used FMISO PET for radiation therapy dose plans with the hypothesis that targeting hypoxic tumor regions with a boost of radiation, as defined by FMISO uptake, would increase survival. These trials did not, however, show improvement when compared to treatment plans with and without a boost of radiation. These outcomes are in direct contrast to the EPR hypoxia studies previously mentioned. We hypothesize this is due to the imperfect binding mechanisms of FMISO to hypoxic cells, as well as general limitations of PET tracers being unable to reach hypoxic tumor regions due to their chaotic vasculature or acidosis. In response to the failure of using only FMISO PET to target hypoxia, we propose to include anatomical and physiological information of tumor vasculature and pH imaged with Dynamic Contrast Enhanced (DCE) MRI and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI, respectively. DCE-MRI and CEST-MRI will be used to correct the PET image to show hypoxic tumor regions, using EPR as the ground truth of hypoxia.  The specific aims of the proposal are to develop and execute a study design to (1) evaluate discrepancies between tumor hypoxia regions as defined by FMISO PET and EPR, (2) identify tumor features in DCE-MRI and CEST-MRI that result in poor overlap between hypoxia as defined by PET and EPR, and (3) develop a correction PET/MRI algorithm to improve PET measurement of hypoxia, using EPR hypoxia measurements as the gold standard. Upon completion, aim 1 will demonstrate the need for correcting FMISO PET images. Aim 2 will identify correlations between vascular permeability and pH features and low or high PET uptake, where it might not match with hypoxia as defined by EPR. The third aim will take those features to create a decision tree algorithm to correct FMISO PET definition of hypoxia. We intend for this PET/MRI correction algorithm to eventually be implemented in clinical trials to improve radiation therapy to hypoxic tumors. Project Narrative The goal of the proposed research is to make FMISO PET more accurate in its measurement of tumor hypoxia. We aim to correct PET data with a combination of MRI images that map physiological properties of the tumor, such as vasculature and pH measurements, while using oxygen measurements from electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging as the ground truth. This work will result in a PET/MRI correction algorithm with the intent to improve radiotherapy techniques and results.",Correcting [18]F-Misonidazole PET with MRI and EPR to improve hypoxia-guided radiation therapy,10234423,F31CA254223,"['Acidosis', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Area', 'Binding', 'Body Temperature', 'Breast Carcinoma', 'Cancer Center', 'Carcinoma', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Cell Line', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Deposition', 'Dose', 'Effectiveness', 'Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Heart Rate', 'Hybrids', 'Hypoxia', 'Hypoxia Inducible Factor', 'Image', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Misonidazole', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Permeability', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Physiology', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Radiation', 'Radiation therapy', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Translating', 'Up-Regulation', 'Vascular Permeabilities', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'contrast enhanced', 'experimental study', 'fibrosarcoma', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'promoter', 'radiation resistance', 'radioresistant', 'response', 'sarcoma', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'tumor hypoxia', 'uptake']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,F31,2021,46036
"Simulation Tools for 3D and 4D CT and Dosimetry Abstract Photon-counting CT (PCCT) is a major technological advance in CT imaging. Using photon-counting instead of current energy-integrating detectors, PCCT can offer superior performance in terms of spatial resolution, artifact reduction, and most notably, material decomposition. PCCT’s energy differentiation utility offers an ability to more precisely distinguish different materials and optimize and expand the use of contrast agents in CT. With these abilities, PCCT can significantly facilitate quantitative imaging, reduce radiation exposure, and enable revolutionary new applications in functional and physiological imaging beyond existing CT techniques. To realize the full potential of PCCT in clinical practice, the technology needs comprehensive assessments and application-based optimizations. Effective design and deployment of PCCT depends on many design and use choices that should be made in view of the eventual clinical utility. Making these choices requires large scale trials on actual patients. However, such trials are challenging, considering the need to make many decisions prior to prototyping, the limited numbers of prototype PCCT scanners available today, and the often-unknown ground-truth in the patient images. Even for existing prototype systems, many decisions require repetitive trials with multiple acquisitions. This is both unethical and impractical considering radiation safety concerns and costs. These challenges can be overcome by utilizing virtual imaging trials (VITs) using computerized patients and imaging models. VITs provide an efficient means with which to determine the most effective and optimized design and use of imaging technologies with complete control over the study design. In our prior funded project, we developed a VIT framework to evaluate standard energy-integrating detector CT technologies. In this project, we expand the applicability of this framework to photon-counting detector CT. Specifically, we enhance our computational XCAT phantoms to model the necessary higher-resolution detail including normal and abnormal tissue heterogeneities and intra-organ contrast perfusion diversity across populations (Aim 1). To image the phantoms, we develop the first PCCT simulator capable of mimicking existing and emerging prototypes (Aim 2). The enhanced VIT framework will provide the essential foundation with which to comprehensively evaluate and optimize PCCT technologies and applications. In Aim 3, we assess and optimize the use of PCCT for morphological, textural, and compositional quantification in select oncologic and cardiac applications, two leading health detriments in the US where PCCT can offer a notable impact. The results will be the first of their kind in comprehensively evaluating the task-based merits and capabilities of PCCT, determining optimum dose per patient size for PCCT imaging of patients for cancerous lesions and cardiac plaque/stenoses, and helping to establish the effective utility of PCCT in clinical care.

"Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection Abstract PET is a molecular imaging modality widely used in oncology studies due to its high sensitivity and the potential of early diagnosis. For neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), 68Ga-DOTATATE PET has been recently used in clinical routine for imaging NETs in adult and pediatric patients since 2016. It plays an important role in the diagnosis and staging of NETs. However, compared to 18F-FDG PET, the image quality of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is lower due to much larger positron range, shorter half-life, and lower dose administration limited by generator capacity. All of these compromises the lesion detectability of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET, especially for small lesions, and can potentially lead to inaccurate NET diagnosis. As 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is increasingly used in clinics, there is an urgent and unmet need to further optimize 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging for NET detection. Recently, data-driven methods have been developed for PET image denoising, where the PET system model is not considered. As the tumor-to-background ratio of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET is greater than 18F-FDG PET, the lesion recovery of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET can be hugely influenced by the smoothing effects as well as potential mismatches between training and testing datasets. In this study, we propose a novel data- informed and lesion detection-driven image reconstruction framework. The PET system model, image denoising module, and lesion-detection module will all be included in this reconstruction framework. The two specific aims of this exploratory proposal are (1) to develop a lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework and validate it based on comprehensive computer simulations, (2) to apply the proposed reconstruction framework to existing clinical 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT datasets and test it based on various figure-of-merits. We expect that the integrated outcome of the specific aims will be a novel and robust image reconstruction framework to better recover lesions in a 68Ga- DOTATATE PET scan, which is essential for NET managements. Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection  Project Narrative Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality widely used in oncology. This project aims to develop a novel lesion detection-driven PET image reconstruction framework. Success of this project can enhance the lesion detectability of current PET imaging protocols, e.g. 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scanning for neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).",Optimization of PET Image Reconstruction for Lesion Detection,10206141,R03EB030280,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Awareness', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Distant Metastasis', 'Dose', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gallium', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Image', 'Incidence', 'Injections', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Noise', 'Oncology', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Reader', 'Recovery', 'Recurrence', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Savings', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer type', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'effectiveness validation', 'experience', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'neural network', 'neuroendocrine differentiation', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'pediatric patients', 'pentetreotide', 'radiologist', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'routine imaging', 'success', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R03,2021,89563
"Permeability Imaging using Simultaneous Dynamic PET and Arterial Spin Labeling MRI Abstract Candidate's Career Goals: Dr. Han has a strong background in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, image reconstruction and arterial spin labeling (ASL), with a Ph.D. in bio and brain engineering. Dr. Han is currently at a junior-faculty rank of instructor at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). His goal is to expand his future career to multi-modality positron emission tomography (PET)-MR imaging for translational research and clinical improvement. His long-term goal is to become an independent, accomplished investigator that can lead future scientific and clinical imaging projects taking full advantage of multi-modality PET-MR imaging. Career Development Plan: Foundational training in PET/PET-MR imaging as well as neurology is proposed for the candidate, an area that the candidate currently lacks knowledge and experience in. The candidate plans to engage in formal course work/seminars, research via one-on-one instructions with mentors and collaborators, conferences/presentations, manuscript/grant preparations, and teaching/leadership roles to grow as an independent investigator in the field of PET-MR imaging and neurology. Research Project: The overall goal of the proposed research is to take advantage of simultaneous dynamic PET and ASL-MR imaging to estimate the permeability surface product (PS) of the PET tracer, which is new physiological information that cannot be obtained with PET or MR alone. PS describes the unidirectional flux rate of macromolecules from the blood plasma into the interstitial space of cellular tissue and is the key metric for assessing the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Knowing the PS of the PET tracer provides powerful capability to probe the physiological delivery process of essential macromolecules involved in the pathogenesis of diseases in relation to BBB, due to the theoretically unlimiting potential in the design of radioactive analogs of important biological compounds. We plan to develop a PET tracer PS mapping method, achieve the first phantom and human study with PS mapping, and study the changes in the spatial distribution of tau neurofibrillary tangles (tau) and amyloid-beta (Aß) plaque depositions in relation to the BBB integrity changes with pathological events associated with the progression of AD, by performing dynamic-PET/mPLD-ASL studies using 18F-T807 and 11C- Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) PET tracers on AD and normal subjects. Environment: MGH provides an ideal setting for conducting research in MR, PET, and PET-MR imaging since multiple state-of-the-art imaging systems are available for preclinical/clinical MR scanners and preclinical simultaneous PET-MR scanners. There is a dynamic flow phantom designed to simulate blood flow for two compartment pharmacokinetics and an MR-compatible pump and detection system for continuous blood sampling suitable for performing ASL flow and PET imaging studies with arterial sampling. Also, there is a shared memory supercomputer ideal for the image reconstruction proposed in the project. MGH is also home to many experts in both PET-MR imaging and neurology who can provide their expertise to this project.

If successful, the proposed technique will allow the extraction of new physiological information, PS, while facilitating a new understanding of the relationships between BBB integrity, neurovascular function and proteinopathy in the etiology and progression of diseases such as AD.",Permeability Imaging using Simultaneous Dynamic PET and Arterial Spin Labeling MRI,10217132,K01EB030045,"['3-Dimensional', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease patient', 'Amino Acids', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood flow', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Educational process of instructing', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'General Hospitals', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Instruction', 'Kinetics', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Leadership', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Massachusetts', 'Measurement', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurology', 'Noise', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Permeability', 'Physiological', 'Pittsburgh Compound-B', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Pump', 'Radial', 'Radioactive', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Senile Plaques', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spin Labels', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'analog', 'attenuation', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical imaging', 'deep learning', 'design', 'detection platform', 'experience', 'human study', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'instructor', 'interstitial', 'macromolecule', 'multimodality', 'neurovascular', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'reconstruction', 'shared memory', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'tau Proteins', 'tau aggregation']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K01,2021,124746
"Can machines be trusted? Robustification of deep learning for medical imaging Machine learning algorithms have become increasing popular in medical imaging, where highly functional algorithms have been trained to recognize patterns or features within image data sets and perform clinically relevant tasks such as tumor segmentation and disease diagnosis. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, by leveraging massive datasets and immense computing power to extract features from data. Deep learning is ideally suited for problems in medical imaging, and has enjoyed success in diverse tasks such as segmenting cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues. However, research in machine learning has also shown that deep learning is fragile in the sense that carefully designed perturbations to an image can cause the algorithm to fail. These perturbations can be designed to be imperceptible by humans, so that a trained radiologist would not make the same mistakes. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation, it is therefore crucial to develop a better understanding of the performance of neural networks. Specifically, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data. The goal of this project is to explore these questions in the context of medical imaging—to better identify strengths, weaknesses, and failure points of deep learning algorithms. We posit that malicious perturbations, of the type studied in theoretical machine learning, may not be representative of the sort of noise encountered in medical images. Although noise is inevitable in a physical system, the noise arising from sources such as subject motion, operator error, or instrument malfunction may have less deleterious effects on a deep learning algorithm. We propose to characterize the effect of these perturbations on the performance of deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we will study the effect of random labeling error introduced into the data set, as might arise due to honest human error. We will also develop new methods for making deep learning algorithms more robust to the types of clinically relevant perturbations described above. In summary, although the susceptibility of neural networks to small errors in the inputs is widely recognized in the deep learning community, our work will investigate these general phenomena in the specific case of medical imaging tasks, and also conduct the first study of average-case errors that could realistically arise in clinical studies. Furthermore, we will produce novel recommendations for how to quantify and improve the resiliency of deep learning approaches in medical imaging. In recent years, an approach known as deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning by achieving superhuman performance on many tasks. As deep learning approaches gain acceptance and move toward clinical implementation in assisting radiologists for tasks such as segmentation of cardiac structures, tumors, and tissues, it is critical to understand the limits of deep learning when presented with noisy or imperfect data.

"Generalizable Deep Learning Networks for Dual-tracer Amyloid/Tau PET/MRI Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease Project Summary  Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and a major public health crisis, currently affecting over 5.8 million Americans and expected to rise as the population ages. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging can identify the hallmark proteinopathies of AD, including amyloid protein plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (composed primarily of tau protein) accumulating in the brain. While there is evident need for more PET neuroimaging, for example, to elucidate the sequence of amyloid and tau deposition in preclinical AD, its increased utility in longitudinal imaging studies with large study populations is limited by recruitment and cost. In particular, making multiple visits to the scanning site will be difficult for participants living far away, and the high cost of injected radiotracers will limit the scalability of PET studies.  In this project we propose using deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to enhance ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau PET for imaging AD. Our specific aims are (1) to validate the diagnostic value of the CNNs in actual ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau imaging sessions, with the injected dose as low as 1% of the original, and with actual ultra-low-dose data, to validate simulations for use in subsequent aims and future studies; (2) to apply the ultra-low-dose CNN to data collected on other PET systems and tracers, in order to demonstrate the CNN’s generalizability; and (3) to evaluate the value of deep learning-aided ultra-low-dose amyloid and tau PET for tracking cognitive decline in a preclinical AD population.  The innovation of this work lies in using multimodal imaging in addition to advanced machine learning techniques to enable acquisition of diagnostic-level PET images at extremely low dose levels. Performing actual ultra-low-dose PET acquisitions is also highly novel in itself. The outcome of this proposal is removing the limiting factors to large-scale clinical longitudinal imaging, shortening acquisitions spanning multiple days and visits to several hours in one visit with a successive ultra-low-dose and full-dose dual-tracer scan protocol. Significant dose reduction can also be achieved, allowing for more frequent amyloid/tau PET scanning. This flexibility will not only increase the utility of PET, aid longitudinal studies in dementia, but enable future comprehensive imaging of multiple PET-based biomarkers as these tracers are being developed. Project Narrative  More frequent PET scans can be used for dementia, a major cause of deaths in the United States, to understand the pathogenesis of the brain proteinopathies involved, to identify at-risk individuals, and to provide outcome markers for clinical trials of anti-amyloid/tau therapies; but recruitment for studies, cost, and radiation dose to the scanned participant are critical factors limiting its use. This work aims to train versatile deep learning-based neural networks which can produce diagnostic-level images from ultra-low-dose (as low as 1%) amyloid and tau PET acquisitions. Our study will provide flexibility in recruitment (running ultra-low-dose and full-dose scans in succession for dual-tracer studies), reduce the cost for radiotracer use, and reduce the dose in scanned participants, a “win-win” for researchers and patients.",Generalizable Deep Learning Networks for Dual-tracer Amyloid/Tau PET/MRI Imaging of Alzheimer's Disease,10214874,K99AG068310,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'American', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid Proteins', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Drowning', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Future', 'Hour', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Injections', 'Investigative Techniques', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurofibrillary Tangles', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patient Recruitments', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radioactivity', 'Reading', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'apolipoprotein E-4', 'base', 'clinical application', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'flexibility', 'imaging agent', 'imaging study', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'longitudinal positron emission tomography', 'machine learning method', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'radiotracer', 'recruit', 'research study', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'simulation', 'study population', 'tau Proteins', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIA,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K99,2021,100863
"Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization Project Summary Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most diagnosed form of non-cutaneous cancer in US men. The selection of patients who require immediate treatment from those suitable for active surveillance currently relies on non- specific and inaccurate measurements. A method that allows clinicians to more confidently discriminate clinically relevant from non-life-threatening tumors is needed to improve patient management. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) is the preferred non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing primary PCa. However, its accuracy for detecting clinically significant PCa is variable. We propose to address this limitation by combining mpMRI with positron emission tomography (PET) with a PCa-specific radiotracer and using advanced multimodal machine learning models (i.e. radiomics and deep learning) to characterize tumor aggressiveness based on the imaging data. Recently, scanners capable of simultaneous PET and MR data acquisition in human subjects have become commercially available. An integrated MR-PET scanner is the ideal tool for comparing MR and PET derived image features to identify those that provide complementary information and build a hybrid PET-mpMRI model that most accurately identifies clinically significant tumors. While this novel technology allows the acquisition of perfectly coregistered complementary anatomical, functional and metabolic data in a single imaging session, a new challenge needs to first be addressed to obtain quantitatively accurate PET data. In an integrated MR-PET scanner, the information needed for PET attenuation correction (AC) has to be derived from the MR data and the methods currently available for this task are inadequate for advanced quantitative studies. We have formed an academic-industrial partnership to accelerate the translation of multimodal MR-PET machine learning approaches into PCa research and clinical applications by addressing the AC challenge and validating machine learning models for detecting clinically significant disease against gold standard histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Specifically, we will: (1) Develop and validate an MR-based approach for obtaining quantitatively accurate PET data. We hypothesize that attenuation maps as accurate as those obtained using a 511 keV transmission source – the true gold standard for PET AC – will be obtained; (2) Identify the multimodal radiomics model that most accurately predicts PCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that the diagnostic accuracy of this approach will be superior to that offered by the stand-alone modalities; (3) Evaluate radiomics and deep learning approaches for predicting pPCa aggressiveness. We hypothesize that machine learning approaches will achieve a higher predictive accuracy when applied to data acquired simultaneously than sequentially. Project narrative A better method to non-invasively characterize primary prostate cancer is needed to improve patient management. Extracting additional information from multimodality quantitative MR-PET data using machine learning approaches is expected to result in better diagnostic performance. In this work, we propose to accelerate the translation of quantitative MR-PET to prostate cancer research and clinical applications. In particular, we will develop and validate an MR-based attenuation correction approach to guarantee that quantitatively accurate PET data are obtained in an integrated MR-PET scanner and then use machine learning approaches to characterize the aggressiveness of the tumors in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy.",Multimodal MR-PET Machine Learning Approaches for Primary Prostate Cancer Characterization,10114224,R01CA218187,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Death Rates', 'Cancer Patient', 'Classification', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Hand', 'Histopathology', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Kinetics', 'Lesion', 'Life Expectancy', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'PSA level', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prostate', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'cancer classification', 'cancer imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'men', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'radiotracer', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,414490
"CT and CXR Phenotyping Platform for Assessing COVID-19 Susceptibility and Severity Abstract COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO on March 11. Since then, there have been 8.15 million confirmed cases worldwide with a case fatality rate ranging from 16.3% to 0.1%. In the US, there have been 2,187,202 cases with a 5.4% case fatality rate as of June 16, 2020. The magnitude of this infectious disease has stressed the need to develop novel methodologies to define who are at the highest risk of developing acute symptoms. X-Ray (CXR) and Computed Tomography (CT) play a fundamental role in the detection and follow-up of the COVID-19 lung injury. It also provides a unique opportunity to define quantitative biomarkers that may identify susceptible subjects to the acute phase of the disease using pre-infection and early infection radiological exams. This proposal's broad objective is to provide a better understanding of acute COVID-19 susceptibility markers based on artificial intelligence approaches on radiological exams, both CT and CXR. CT offers a unique way to phenotype the lung and its changes. Subtle changes of normal parenchyma have been associated with systemic inflammation that can be detected on CT. We hypothesize that susceptible subjects for acute COVID- 19 disease evolution will express inflamed normal parenchymal signatures that can be measured on CT scan prior to the infection or in the early phases of the viral infection. We will develop new computational approaches to identify radiographic patterns consistent with inflamed normal parenchyma as well as early COVID-19 injury and compute radiomics signature that can capture the heterogeneity of the radiographic expression for each lung pattern. We will define new CT-based biomarkers for acute COVID-19 susceptibility using Gradient Boosting decision trees and feature importance. We will then translate the quantification of the most relevant features in CXR image using image translation approaches based on deep neural networks. Finally, we will integrate these automated tools in the CIP workstation using clinically friendly end-to-end workflows to empower clinical investigations across the world. We will continue the support and dissemination of this tool across the research community. Over the last 15 years, our group has developed the Chest Imaging Platform (CIP), an NIH-funded open-source software tool for the automated phenotyping of chest CT scans that is widely used in the chronic lung disease research community. Since the beginning of the pandemic, CIP has been used to the characterization of COVID-19 using existing densitometric metrics. Our commitment to open science in the form of open toolkits that are freely distributed is fundamental to catalyze the application of AI and imaging in the context of this pandemic. Project Narrative As of June 16, there has been 2.18 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the United States with 118,435 fatalities. Unlike many other diseases, only general epidemiological factors are available for describing the susceptibility to COVID-19 and its acute phase.

"Improved Techniques for Substitute CT Generation from MRI datasets This proposal will enable improved substitute CT images for use in PET/MR and MR-only radiation treatment planning. Given the greatly improved soft-tissue contrast of MR relative to CT, which aids interpretation of PET for PET/MR and target delineation for radiation treatment planning, a remaining limitation is the current capability to obtain sufficiently accurate substitute CT images from only MR-data. Unfortunately, MRI has limited capability to resolve bone and the inability of most MR acquisitions to distinguish between air and bone makes segmentation of these tissues types challenging. This project will utilize deep learning, a new and growing area of machine learning, to develop new methodology to create substitute CT images from rapid MR acquisitions that can be utilized in PET/MR and radiation treatment planning workflows. In Aim 1 we will study rapid MR acquisitions to be used with deep learning approaches for sCT generation in the head and pelvis using 3T PET/MR images matched with PET/CT imaging to create deep learning training and evaluation datasets. Different deep learning networks and MR inputs will be studied and adapted to determine the best PET reconstruction performance. In Aim 2 we will investigate rapid but motion-resilient approaches to whole- body MR imaging for subsequent deep learning-based substitute CT generation. In an exploratory subaim, we also propose to study methods of sCT generation that only utilize PET-only data. The data acquired in Aim 2 will be used to create comprehensive whole-body, motion-resilient datasets for training and evaluation of deep learning networks. In Aim 3 we will evaluate substitute CT approaches for MR-only radiation treatment planning. MR-only approaches will be compared to standard CT-based treatment simulation in the brain, head & neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis and deep learning networks will be optimized and evaluated for region- specific RT planning and simulation. Additionally, transfer learning approaches will be studied to extend sCT to a 0.35T MR-Linac to demonstrate respiratory motion resolved substitute CT generation.

Current image guided RT often relies on the use of implanted fiducial markers (FMs) for online/offline target localization, which is invasive and costly, and introduces possible bleeding, infection and discomfort of the patient. In this project, we harness the enormous potential of deep learning and investigate a novel markerless localization strategy by combined use of a pre-trained deep learning model and kV X-ray projection or cone beam CT images. We hypothesize that incorporation of deep layers of image information allows us to visualize otherwise invisible target in real-time and greatly reduce the uncertainties in beam targeting. Specific aims of the project are to: (1) Develop a DL-based tumor target localization framework for image guided RT (IGRT); (2) Apply the DL-based strategy to localize prostate target on 2D kV X-ray projection and 3D CBCT images; and (3) Evaluate the potential clinical impact of the DL strategy for pancreatic IGRT. This study brings up, for the first time, highly accurate markerless target localization based on deep learning and provides a clinically sensible solution for IGRT of prostate and pancreas cancers or other types of cancers. Successful completion of this investigation will significantly advance the current beam targeting technique and provide radiation oncology discipline a powerful way to safely and reliably escalate the radiation dose for precision RT. Given its significant promise to optimally cater for inter- and intra-fractional uncertainties, the study should lead to substantial improvement in patient care and enables us to utilize maximally the technical capability of modern RT such as IMRT and VMAT. Given the dose responsive nature of various cancers and that the proposed method requires no hardware modification, this research should lead to a widespread impact on the management of neoplasmic diseases affected by organ motion. Leveraging deep learning for markerless motion management in radiation therapy Project Narrative This project is aimed at establishing a deep learning-based image guidance strategy for motion management in prostate and pancreas radiation therapy. Successful completion of this investigation will significantly advance the current beam targeting technique and provide radiation oncology discipline a powerful way to safely and reliably escalate the radiation dose for precision radiation therapy.

"Copper-mediated Radiofluorination: from Proof-of-Concept to Clinical Impact Abstract: Radiotracers containing [18F]-labeled electron-rich aromatic rings are among the most highly sought- after PET imaging agents but have been historically challenging to synthesize. Recent efforts have sought to improve the late-stage labeling of (hetero)arenes with [18F]fluoride. In particular, transition metal-mediated reactions using high molar activity [18F]fluoride have changed the way radiochemists form C–18F bonds, and copper-mediated radiofluorination (CMRF) has proven one of the most versatile of approaches. In the previous award, we reported 10 new CMRF reactions, validated them for Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), and used them to synthesize FDA-approved clinical doses. However, despite many successes, several key challenges remain for the widespread clinical application of CMRF: (a) many important organic scaffolds are incompatible with existing CMRF processes, (b) yields of automated CMRF methods are typically moderate and thus unsuitable for commercial distribution, and (c) disposable cassette technologies are not available for CMRF on automated radiosynthesizers, limiting radiotracer production for routine clinical use. All of these challenges will be addressed in this renewal proposal. The overall objective is to develop robust methods for clinical production of diverse PET radiotracers. Our central hypothesis is that CMRF is uniquely positioned to enable us to achieve this goal. The proposed research will identify new reactions to radiofluorinate scaffolds that are incompatible with existing CMRF (Aim 1), use cutting edge machine learning techniques to improve automated CMRF yields (Aim 2), and develop cassette technologies for reliable GMP production of clinical radiotracers using CMRF (Aim 3). The research is significant because it entails development of methods for radiolabeling bioactive molecules containing functionality that is incompatible (or low yielding) with existing CMRF (heterocycles like pyridine and morpholine, drug molecules like GW405833), as well as optimized automated methods and cassettes for radiotracers that have been challenging to access for decades (e.g. [18F]FDOPA). The viability of the proposed efforts is supported by extensive preliminary results that provide groundwork for the exciting new research directions. Our team has been collaborating for 7 years and our expertise in transition metal catalysis (Sanford), radiochemistry (Scott), and machine learning (Doyle) uniquely positions us to accomplish the proposed research. The project goals will be accomplished through a variety of innovations including: (1) developing methods for labeling challenging electron-rich (hetero)arenes from new precursors (C–H bonds, aryl halides), (2) the first application of machine learning to radiochemistry, and (3) development of automated cassettes for conducting CMRF using the newest generation of radiosynthesizers designed for plug-and-play production. Overall, this project will deliver multiple new methods for synthesizing 18F-labeled radiotracers that are inaccessible using existing methods, and validated clinical syntheses of important radiotracers. All of these deliverables will expand the utility of PET imaging for the detection, treatment, and prevention of disease. Project Narrative: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is a non-invasive molecular imaging technique that allows real-time in vivo monitoring of physiological processes via administration of a radiotracer (a molecule tagged with a PET radioisotope) to a patient. Currently, PET imaging finds application in drug discovery, disease diagnosis and monitoring, and personalized medicine. Approximately 2 million PET scans are conducted annually, and there is significant room for further growth. However, the impact of PET cannot be fully realized without both new synthetic methods for the assembly of radiotracers as well as the translation of these synthesis methods to routine clinical production. The overall objective of our research is to develop new chemistry for preparing currently inaccessible PET radiotracers, use machine learning techniques to optimize production yields with these new methods, and introduce automated cassette technology that will allow easy and confident use of this new chemistry to produce PET radiotracers for clinical trials and routine standard of care.",Copper-mediated Radiofluorination: from Proof-of-Concept to Clinical Impact,10209444,R01EB021155,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Automation', 'Award', 'Basic Science', 'Caring', 'Catalysis', 'Chemistry', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Copper', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Electrons', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorides', 'Fluorine', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hydrogen Bonding', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Label', 'Levodopa', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nuclear', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacy facility', 'Physiological Processes', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Production', 'Publishing', 'Radiochemistry', 'Radioisotopes', 'Radiolabeled', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Side', 'Site', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Transition Elements', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'aryl halide', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cost', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder prevention', 'drug discovery', 'imaging agent', 'imaging detection', 'improved', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'method development', 'molecular imaging', 'morpholine', 'neural network', 'personalized medicine', 'preclinical imaging', 'predictive modeling', 'pyridine', 'radiotracer', 'random forest', 'scaffold', 'standard of care', 'success']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,377343
"Nonlinear performance analysis and prediction for robust low dose lung CT 1 PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  2 Nonlinear algorithms such as model-based reconstruction (MBR) and deep learning (DL) reconstruction have  3 sparked tremendous research interest in recent years. Compared to traditional linear approaches, the nonline-  4 arity of these algorithm transcends traditional signal-to-noise requirement and offer flexibility to draw information  5 from a variety of sources (e.g., statistical model, prior image, dictionary, training data). MBR has enabled numer-  6 ous advancements including low-dose CT and advanced scanning protocols. Deep learning algorithms are rap-  7 idly emerging and have demonstrated superior dose vs. image quality tradeoffs in research settings. However,  8 widespread clinical adoption of nonlinear algorithms has been impeded by the lack of a lack of systematic, quan-  9 titative methods for performance analysis. Nonlinear methods come with numerous dependencies on the imag- 10 ing techniques, the imaging target, and the prior information, and the data itself. The relationship between these 11 dependencies and image quality is often opaque. Furthermore, improper selection of algorithmic parameters can 12 lead to erroneous features (e.g., smaller lesions, texture) in the reconstruction. Therefore, methods to quantify 13 and predict performance permit efficient and quantifiable performance evaluation to provide the robust control 14 and understanding of imaging output necessary for reliable clinical application and regulatory oversight. 15 We propose to establish a robust, predictive framework for performance assessment and optimization that can 16 be generalized to any reconstruction method. We quantify performance in turns of the perturbation response and 17 covariance as a function of imaging techniques, system configurations, patient anatomy, and, importantly, the 18 perturbation itself. The perturbation response quantifies the appearance (e.g., biases, blurs, distortions), and, 19 together with the covariance, allows the computation of more complex metrics such as task-based performance 20 and radiomic measures including size, shape, and texture information. We illustrate utility of the approach in lung 21 imaging with the following specific aims: Aim 1: Develop a lesion library and generate perturbations encom- 22 passing clinically relevant features. We will extract lesions from public databases and develop methods lesion 23 emulation in for realistic CT simulation and physical data via 3D printing technology. Aim 2: Develop a gener- 24 alized prediction framework for perturbation response and covariance. Using analytical and neural network 25 modeling, we will establish a framework that predicts perturbation response and covariance across imaging 26 scenarios for classes of algorithms with increasing data-dependence including MBR with a Huber penalty, MBR 27 with dictionary regularization, and a deep learning reconstructor. Aim 3: Develop assessment and optimiza- 28 tion strategies to drive robust, low dose lung screening CT methods. We will optimize and adapt nonlinear 29 algorithms and protocols for lung cancer screening to achieve faithful representations of clinical features. This 30 work has the potential to drive much-needed quantitative assessment standards that directly relate image quality 31 to diagnostic performance and optimal strategies for robust, reliable clinical deployment of nonlinear algorithms. 32 PROJECT NARRATIVE Major research efforts have been devoted to the development of nonlinear reconstruction algorithms – from model-based reconstruction to deep learning, these algorithms have demonstrated many advantages such as improved image quality, reduced radiation dose, and additional diagnostic information that are not achievable with traditional linear reconstructions. However, only a disproportionately small number has reach the clinic due to the lack of a predictive image quality analysis framework to quantify diagnostic performance, control algorithm behavior, and ensure consistent performance for robust clinical deployment. The propose effort use a combination of analytic and machine learning approaches to drive much-needed quantitative assessment standards that directly relate image quality to diagnostic performance and establish optimal strategies for robust, reliable clinical deployment of nonlinear algorithms.",Nonlinear performance analysis and prediction for robust low dose lung CT,10121056,R01CA249538,"['3D Print', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Beauty', 'Behavior', 'Biological Models', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dictionary', 'Digital Libraries', 'Dimensions', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Libraries', 'Lung', 'Lung CAT Scan', 'Lung nodule', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nodule', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Statistical Models', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Training', 'Transcend', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'exhaustion', 'flexibility', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'low dose computed tomography', 'lung cancer screening', 'machine learning method', 'neural network', 'novel', 'predicting response', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'screening', 'shape analysis', 'simulation', 'success', 'targeted imaging']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,512567
"Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning Project Summary Positron-emission tomography (PET) is an imaging modality that allows clinicians and researchers to study the physiological or pathological processes of the human body, and in particular the brain via the use of specific tracers. For brain PET imaging, patient head movement during scanning presents a challenge for accurate PET image reconstruction and subsequent quantitative analysis. Problems due to head motion are exacerbated by the long duration of the scans, with scan times commonly over one hour. Furthermore, some PET studies specifically involve subjects that either have trouble staying still due to psychological variations, e.g. patients with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, or psychological variations, e.g. subjects with anxiety disorders, or are required to participate in tasks that involve movement, e.g. smoking cigarettes while scanning. In brain scans, the average head motion can vary from 7 mm in clinical scans to triple this amount for longer research scans. Quantitatively, a 5 mm head motion can produce biases of up to ~35% in regional intensities and ∼15% in volume of distribution estimates, which could much larger than the difference observed in regional intensities or binding potential that distinguish different demographic groups being studied. The ability to track and correct head motion, therefore, would be of high utility in both clinical and research PET studies. In the past, many motion correction methods have been proposed. However, except for hardware-based approaches, there has been no method that can track frequent head motion on-the-fly during the PET acquisition. Hardware-based approaches are not readily available for clinical translation or used by other research facilities due to highly-customized software/hardware setup. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a data-driven methodology using deep learning to track and estimate rigid head motion using PET raw data, and incorporate both tracer type and time as conditional variables into this deep neural network design in order to handle diverse PET tracer types and their dynamic behavior. Overall, these solutions will provide for a data-driven motion estimation methodology to improve the quality of PET imaging. Specifically, we will start with the development and testing of our methodology for rigid head motion estimation using single-tracer PET raw data. Then we will perform evaluation of our multi-tracer motion estimation methodology applied to real PET data with a diverse range of tracers. Finally, in the exploratory phase, we will integrate time-of-flight information into deep learning-based motion prediction. The significance of this proposal is that it will allow for improved quality of PET imaging in real time and potentially allow for its use in clinical PET systems that do not have special motion tracking hardware. This work will serve as a first step towards developing data-driven motion estimation algorithms for full body PET imaging. The innovation lies in the development of what is a data-driven solution to the problem of real time motion estimation. Project Narrative Positron-emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain is a highly useful tool for biomedical research and clinical practice. Head motion during scanning degrades PET image quality and introduces image artifacts. We propose to develop new data-driven methods, based on PET raw data, to estimate head motion using deep learning, which can be used for real time motion estimation in PET imaging.",Data-driven Head Motion Correction in PET Imaging Using Deep Learning,10144432,R21EB028954,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cigarette', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology)', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Funding', 'Gold', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Human body', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological Processes', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Smoking', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'density', 'design', 'effectiveness evaluation', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neural network', 'novel', 'psychologic', 'reconstruction', 'research facility', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,209375
"Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT Coronary artery disease remains a major public health problem worldwide. It causes approximately 1 of every 6 deaths in the United States. Imaging of myocardial perfusion (delivery of blood to the heart muscle) by myocardial perfusion single photon emission tomography (MPS) allows physicians to detect disease before heart attacks occur and is currently used to predict risk in millions of patients annually. Under the current grant, we have established a unique collaborative multicenter registry including over 23,000 imaging datasets (REFINE SPECT) with both prognostic (major adverse cardiovascular events) and diagnostic (invasive catheterization) outcomes. Using this registry, we have demonstrated that a combination of MPS image analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) tools achieved superior predictive performance compared to visual assessment by experienced readers or current state-of-the-art quantitative techniques. In the renewal, we plan to expand REFINE SPECT with now-available enhanced datasets (adding CT and myocardial blood flow information) and leverage latest AI advances to provide a personalized decision support tool for patient-specific cardiovascular risk assessment and estimation of benefit from revascularization following MPS. The overall aim is to optimize the clinical capabilities of MPS in risk prediction and treatment guidance by integrating all available imaging and clinical data with state-of-the-art AI methods. For this work, we propose the following 3 specific aims: (1) To expand and enhance our REFINE SPECT registry including CT and MPS flow data, (2) To develop fully automated techniques for all MPS and CT image analysis, (3) To apply explainable deep learning time-to-event AI models for optimal prediction of MACE and benefit from revascularization from all image and clinical data. This work will result in an immediately deployable clinical tool, which will optimally predict risk of adverse events and establish the relative benefits from specific therapies, beyond what is possible by subjective visual analysis and mental integration of all imaging (MPS, CT, flow), and clinical data by physicians. Such quantitative integrative methods are not yet available, leaving the current practice for assessing risk and recommending therapy highly subjective. The precise quantitative results will be presented to clinicians in easy to understand terms (e.g., % risk per year, or relative risk of one therapy vs. the alternative) for a specific patient. Additionally, our methods to make AI conclusions more tangible will improve adoption of this technology. All results will be derived fully automatically thus eliminating any variability. Our approach will fit into current MPS practice and will be immediately translatable to clinics worldwide. Most importantly, this research will allow patients to benefit from increased precision and accuracy in risk assessment, thereby optimizing the use of imaging in guiding patient management decisions and ultimately improving outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Myocardial perfusion imaging with SPECT is often used to predict who is at risk of heart attack and should undergo treatment such as coronary bypass or stenting; however, physicians read images visually and report results with wide variability. With the latest artificial intelligence tools and new types of imaging (including CT and fast SPECT scans), the investigators propose to develop and validate an automated clinical tool to optimize risk prediction and objectively establish the relative benefit of a specific therapy. This new tool will consider all available patient images and other relevant information to provide a personalized explanation and precise calculation of risk and potential benefits from therapy for each patient.",Quantitative Prediction of Disease and Outcomes from Next Generation SPECT and CT,10110023,R01HL089765,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Calcium', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Catheterization', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Artery Bypass', 'Country', 'Cox Models', 'Cox Proportional Hazards Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Event', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'International', 'Joints', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Registries', 'Relative Risks', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Estimate', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Statistical Models', 'Stents', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'Visual', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'adverse event risk', 'attenuation', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'clinically relevant', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized decision', 'prognostic', 'radiotracer', 'relating to nervous system', 'risk prediction', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'support tools', 'time use', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,777637
"Plaque Risk Stratification Using Routinely Available CCTA to Optimize Therapeutic Decision-making in Patients with Known or Suspected Coronary Artery Disease Project Summary/Abstract New treatments have been revolutionary in improving outcomes over the last 30 years, yet cardiovascular disease still exerts a $320B annual burden on the US economy. Increasing evidence is showing that Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA) may be an ideal modality to fill gaps in understanding the extent and rate of progression coronary artery disease. But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides. Currently available solutions do not overcome the barriers – a new approach is needed. Elucid Bioimaging has developed an image analysis software product vascuCAP (CAP stands for Computer Aided Phenotyping) to accurately quantify structural and morphological characteristics of plaque tissues linked to plaque rupture vulnerability. Fundamental to our approach is validated, objective quantitative accuracy; vascuCAP enjoys the most robust and well documented analytic validation of any plaque morphology software available. vascuCAP is the only system to mitigate specific issues in CT reconstruction known to effect accurate measurement of atherosclerotic plaque composition in routinely acquired CTA; it is the only system to effectively leverage objective tissue characterization validated by histology across multiple arterial beds; it achieves an effective resolution with routinely acquired CTA in the same ballpark as IVUS VH, based on solid mathematics principles that respect the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem; and it innovates by novel reporting that expresses the findings in a manner that fits efficiently into existing clinical workflows. vascuCAP has been implemented in a client-server model supporting SaaS. Working from our strong current device clearances, this research strategy is developed based on approved meeting notes from the FDA pre-submission process Phenotype classification claims to be cleared through direct De Novo pathway on the basis of accurately determining the class from in vivo CTA data relative to pathologist annotation on ex vivo specimen data. Risk prediction claims: validate ability to predict adverse events at one year, adding the IFU according to the direct De Novo pathway, One does not strictly depend on the other.This proposal is innovative in dealing with two fundamental limitations of the application of artificial intelligence and deep learning to the analysis of atherosclerosis imaging data. This proposal maximizes use of available retrospective data while putting in place the necessary structure for prospective validation and scale up. This proposal further develops vascuCAP as a tool that may reduce cost and length of clinical trials. While out of scope for this grant, it is important to also note that vascuCAP is innovative in its ability to support multi-scale modeling across cellular/molecular-level analyses and macroscopic manifestation. Also, vascuCAP’s quantitative ability makes it ideal for analysis of more advanced CT imaging protocols. These attributes complement and support the proposed objectives.

But despite the apparent promise of CCTA, there are barriers that prevent realizing the improvement that it theoretically provides which currently available solutions do not overcome.

"Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques PROJECT SUMMARY Symptomatic urinary stone disease (USD) affects >8% of the United States population, resulting in an estimated annual medical cost exceeding $10 billion. Computed tomography (CT) is the established method for imaging urinary calculi and can provide accurate sub-millimeter details of the size and location of renal stones. However, in vivo characterization of more than just size and location is critical for quantifying stone characteristics important for optimal patient health management and essential for clinical research. A complete characterization of renal stones, including stone composition and fragility, is needed for safe and cost effective management of USD, as well as for phenotyping of research subjects. Our proposal meets these needs by developing methods to accurately and non-invasively characterize stones using low-dose, multi-energy CT. Our long-term goal is to use advanced CT methodologies to characterize urinary calculi for the purpose of directing clinical treatment and facilitating clinical investigation. Our objectives in this application are to develop and validate in vivo quantitative techniques for characterizing mixed and non-uric-acid stone types, as well as for predicting the likelihood of successful stone comminution, a novel concept we refer to as stone fragility. These image-based stone biometrics will enable evidence-based identification of treatment strategies that maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk, as well as accurate and non-invasive classification of research subjects to accelerate scientific advances in the understanding and treatment of USD. We will meet these objectives by accomplishing the following specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: Develop and validate CT techniques to characterize mixed and non-uric-acid  stone types.  Specific Aim 2: Develop and validate CT techniques to predict stone fragility. Current state-of-the-art stone imaging technology cannot accurately identify the composition of mixed and non- uric-acid stone types, nor can it provide quantitative indications of the likelihood of efficient comminution using the lowest risk technique. The innovation of this proposal lies in the use of newly developed statistical, deep learning and texture analysis techniques to quantitatively describe essential characteristics of urinary calculi, namely composition and fragility. The significance of this proposal is that the knowledge derived from using such techniques represents unique quantitative biomarkers that will allow physicians and researchers to more effectively manage and study USD. The developed methods respond to critical needs in the field of stone disease and will advance the ability of physicians to optimally direct patient therapy and scientists to phenotype research subjects. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal will develop imaging techniques that can determine urinary stone composition and fragility in patients. The significance of this is that these advanced CT imaging techniques will allow physicians to more efficiently direct patient therapy and perform clinical research, potentially avoiding procedures associated with higher risk or cost.","Quantitative, non-invasive characterization of urinary stone composition and fragility using multi-energy CT and machine learning techniques",10129958,R01EB028591,"['Affect', 'Alkalies', 'Bilateral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biometry', 'Calcium Oxalate', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Cost Effective Management', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Effectiveness', 'Excision', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney Calculi', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Minerals', 'Morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Publishing', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Subjects', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'United States', 'Ureteroscopy', 'Uric Acid', 'Urinary Calculi', 'Validation', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'attenuation', 'base', 'calcium phosphate', 'clinical investigation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'evidence base', 'health management', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'photon-counting detector', 'prevent', 'risk minimization', 'statistical learning', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,350335
"Deformable motion compensation for 3D image-guided interventional radiology PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT C-arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) plays an increasing role in guidance of interventional radiology (IR) procedures in the abdo- men, with special emphasis in embolization procedures, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) or transarterial embolization (TAE) for control of internal hemorrhage. However, relatively long scan time of CBCT results in artifacts arising from organ motion (respiratory and cardiac motion and peristalsis). This poses a significant challenge to guidance in interventional radiology: for example, motion artifacts were found to render up to 25% of CBCT images un-interpretable in image-guided TACE, and 18% in CBCT-guided emergency TAE. The impact of motion is most significant in cases of single or isolated lesions treated with selective embolization that requires visual- ization of very small vascular structures. Existing motion correction methods often invoke assumption of periodicity, lim- iting their applicability outside of cardiac and respiratory motions, or rely on fiducial tracking or gated acquisition that disrupt IR workflow and/or increase radiation dose. Therefore, the application of CBCT in image-guided interventional procedures in the abdomen would significantly benefit from new methods that estimate complex deformable motion directly from image data. “Autofocus” techniques based on maximization of a regularized image sharpness criterion were shown to yield effective patient motion compensation in extremity, head and cardiac CBCT. However, current applications of such methods are limited to rigid motions. We hypothesize that deformable organ motion compensation in interven- tional soft-tissue CBCT can be achieved with advanced autofocus techniques using multiple locally rigid regions of in- terest, preconditioned with basic motion characteristics obtained through a machine learning decision framework. The following aims will be pursued: 1) Develop a joint multi-region autofocus optimization method to compensate deforma- ble organ motion. This includes incorporation into a comprehensive artifacts correction and image reconstruction pipe- line, design of multi-stage optimization schedules for convergence acceleration, and performance evaluation in deforma- ble phantoms, and cadaver and animal experiments. 2) Develop a decision framework for preconditioning of the motion compensation method through a combination of projection-based approaches for physiological signal estimations (res- piratory cycle) and a multi-input, multi-branch, deep learning architecture trained on extremely realistic simulated data that will estimate basic properties of motion (spatial distribution of amplitude, direction, and frequency) from an initial motion-contaminated image and its associated raw projection data. 3) Evaluate deformable motion compensation in animal experiments and in a clinical study in 50 cases of CBCT-guided TACE and assess image quality via expert observer evaluation of satisfaction and utility. The proposed work will yield a robust, practical method for compensation of deform- able soft-tissue motion in CBCT, removing a critical impediment to 3D guidance in IR. The deformable autofocus frame- work will be applicable to other interventions in which soft-tissue motion diminishes CBCT guidance, such as image-guided radiation therapy. PROJECT NARRATIVE Interventional Cone Beam CT (CBCT) provides critical 3D information to guide minimally-invasive procedures in the abdomen, but CBCT image quality is often compromised by organ deformation due to breathing, cardiac, and peristaltic motions. We propose a novel framework to mitigate the effects of this complex deformable motion using only the CBCT image data, without a need for gating, external trackers, or fiducial markers. This algorithm will remove a major impediment to 3D guidance in procedures such as transcatheter embolization procedures in the abdomen.",Deformable motion compensation for 3D image-guided interventional radiology,10100337,R01EB030547,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Angiography', 'Animal Experiments', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Arterial Embolization', 'Arteries', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Cadaver', 'Cardiac', 'Characteristics', 'Chemoembolization', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Emergency Situation', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Family suidae', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluoroscopy', 'Frequencies', 'Head', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Intervention', 'Interventional radiology', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Limb structure', 'Liver', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Peristalsis', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate Ablation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Role', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Embolization', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'arm', 'base', 'clinical application', 'cone-beam computed tomography', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'feeding', 'heart motion', 'image guided', 'image guided intervention', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'internal control', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'preconditioning', 'radiologist', 'respiratory', 'satisfaction', 'simulation', 'soft tissue', 'standard care', 'tumor']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,368438
"Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment Abstract Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT) with preferential delivery of 90Y microspheres to target lesions has shown promising response rates with limited toxicity in the treatment of hepatocellular (HCC), the second leading cause of cancer death in the world. However, to achieve more durable responses, there is much room to improve/adapt the treatment to ensure that all lesions and lesion sub-regions receive adequate radiation delivery. While externally delivered stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is well suited for smaller solitary HCC, its application for larger or multifocal disease is challenged by the radiation tolerance of the normal liver parenchyma. A dosimetry guided combined approach that exploits complementary advantages of internal and external radiation delivery can be expected to improve treatment of HCC. To make this transition, however, prospective clinical trials establishing safety are needed. Furthermore, for routine clinic use, accurate and fast voxel-level dose estimation in internal radionuclide therapy, that lags behind external beam therapy dosimetry, is still needed. Our long-term goal is to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy with personalized dosimetry guided treatment. Our objective in this application is to demonstrate that it is possible to use 90Y imaging based absorbed dose estimates after SIRT to safely deliver external radiation to target regions (voxels) that are predicted to be underdosed and to develop deep learning based tools to make voxel-level internal dose estimation practical for routine clinic use. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will perform a Phase 1 clinical trial in HCC patients where we will take the novel approach of using the 90Y PET/CT derived absorbed dose map after SIRT to deliver SBRT to tumor regions predicted to be underdosed based on previously established dose-response models. The primary objective of the trial is to obtain estimates of safety of combined SIRT+SBRT for future Phase II trial design. In parallel, in Aim 2, building on promising initial results we will develop novel deep learning based tools for 90Y PET/CT and SPECT/CT reconstruction, joint reconstruction-segmentation and scatter estimation under the low count-rate setting, typical for 90Y. These methods have a physics/mathematics foundation, where convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are included within the iterative reconstruction process, instead of post-reconstruction denoising. In Aim 3, we will develop a CNN for fast voxel-level dosimetry and combine with the CNNs of Aim 2 to develop an innovative end-to-end framework with unified dosimetry-task based training. At the end of this study, we will be ready to use the new deep learning tools in a Phase II trial to demonstrate enhanced efficacy with SIRT+SBRT compared with SIRT alone and advance towards our long- term goal. This will accelerate adoption of these next-generation tools in clinical practice and will have a significant positive impact because treatment based on patient specific dosimetry will substantially improve efficacy, compared with current standard practice in SIRT. Although we focus on 90Y SIRT, our tools will be applicable in radionuclide therapy in general, a rapidly advancing treatment option. Narrative We will perform a Phase I clinical trial where standard-of-care Y-90 microsphere radioembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma will be followed by external radiation to target regions that are predicted to be underdosed by Y-90, based on patient specific dosimetry. In parallel, we will develop and test voxel-level internal dosimetry tools using convolution neural networks to make such dosimetry-based planning accurate and fast for routine clinic use. This study is relevant to public health because a dosimetry-guided combination radiation treatment approach is likely to substantially improve patient outcome compared to current standard practice of internal or external radiation only.",Imaging and Dosimetry of Yttrium-90 for Personalized Cancer Treatment,10206138,R01EB022075,"['90Y', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Ensure', 'Evaluable Disease', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Failure', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hepatotoxicity', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver parenchyma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phase I Clinical Trials', 'Photons', 'Physics', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radioembolization', 'Radionuclide therapy', 'Reporting', 'Safety', 'Scanning', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Training', 'base', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'dosimetry', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging Segmentation', 'improved', 'innovation', 'internal radiation', 'learning strategy', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized cancer therapy', 'phase II trial', 'prospective', 'radiation delivery', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'standard of care', 'tool', 'trial design', 'tumor']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,657625
"Deep Learning Reconstruction for Improved TOF PET Using Histo-Image Partitioning Project Summary  Clinical and research applications of the PET imaging are rapidly expanding from ever improving diagnostic and treatment assessment applications to guidance of personalized treatments, ultra-low dose imaging, and even interventional imaging procedures. Supporting these developments, reconstruction tools that are able to reliably handle both typical and (ultra-)low count situations, imperfect data, and data from specialized imaging geometries, with fast (near real-time) reconstruction performance are of crucial importance. The overall goal of this project is to develop and investigate robust and efficacious Deep Learning (DL) reconstruction approaches addressing these needs. A unique and innovative feature of the proposed approaches (compared to alternative DL applications) is the utilization of list-mode data histogrammed into a very efficient histo-image format. TOF data partitioned into the histo-image format are characterized by strong local properties, thus perfectly fitting convolutional neural network formalism and making DL training and reconstruction directly from realistic clinical data (in size and character) highly feasible and practical.  The clinical utility of PET systems has significantly improved over the years thanks to advances in instrumentation, data corrections, and reconstruction approaches. Nevertheless, full utilization of their potential through robust and fast quantitative reconstruction remains a challenge especially for the cases of very low count data, such as in low-count temporal (motion and dynamic) frames, delayed studies, longitudinal low-dose studies, and studies using new isotopes with long half-life and low positron fraction rates (e.g. in 89Zr-labeled CAR-T cell imaging), as well as in specialized PET systems with partial angular coverage, for which exact, artifact-free, reconstruction does not exist. These are the situations for which the developed DL approaches promise great potential due to the demonstrated success of the DL networks to be trained for imperfect and very low count data without reliance on accurate data models. Furthermore, pre-trained networks can provide ultra- fast, near real-time, performance in practical use.  Specific Aim 1 will develop tools for DL PET reconstruction using histo-image partitioning along with procedures for training of the proposed DL approaches, including novel approaches advancing the state-of-the- art of DL reconstruction directly from acquired PET data. Specific Aim 2 is directed towards study and evaluation of the performance of the investigated DL approaches for whole-body and long axial FOV scanner data for the wide range of counts from applications such as typical FDG, low dose, delayed, low activity isotope scans, and ultra-short frames in motion correction and dynamic studies. Specific Aim 3 will develop and apply motion correction protocols involving the proposed DL reconstruction tools and test and study their efficacy for clinically realistic situations involving non-rigid lung and heart motions. And finally, Specific Aim 4 is dedicated to an application and study of the developed DL approaches to specialized PET systems with partial angular coverage. 1 Project Narrative  The major goal of this project is to improve the diagnostic, treatment guidance, and research utility of quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, through the development of robust, near real-time, deep-learning based reconstruction approaches allowing efficacious use of standard, low dose, and novel low activity imaging molecular bio-tracers. The proposed work is relevant to public health, since an improvement in the reconstructed images will lead to more accurate diagnosis of diseases and more accurate treatment guidance and monitoring of the response to therapy, while allowing for decreased patient radiation dose. It will also facilitate quantitatively reliable tools for research investigations with new radiotracers for PET tailored to specific diseases. 2",Deep Learning Reconstruction for Improved TOF PET Using Histo-Image Partitioning,10276952,R01EB031806,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Application procedure', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Breast', 'Case Study', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Half-Life', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Isotopes', 'Label', 'Lung', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physics', 'Positron', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Training Technics', 'Validation', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'base', 'breast imaging', 'cellular imaging', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cells', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinically relevant', 'convolutional neural network', 'data modeling', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'detector', 'disease diagnosis', 'efficacy evaluation', 'heart motion', 'improved', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'learning network', 'loss of function', 'molecular imaging', 'neural network', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'proton therapy', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'solid state', 'statistics', 'success', 'tomography', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,620138
"Evaluation of treatment predictors reflecting beta-catenin activation in hepatocellular carcinoma PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide and its incidence is rising in both men and women in the United States. Anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) antibodies are now FDA approved for advanced HCC, however, as few as 20% of patients receiving these agents will show an objective response to therapy. Because immune-related adverse events are non-trivial, predictive biomarkers that can explain the variability in immunotherapy response are needed to optimize patient selection.  Several lines of research have recently converged to associate oncogenic activation of the Wnt/beta- catenin signaling pathway with tumor immune-evasion and poor clinical response to ICI therapy in HCC. In previous research, we found that HCC exhibiting high uptake of the positron emission tomography / computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging agent 18F- fluorocholine (FCH) often belonged to molecular tumor sub-types associated with beta-catenin activation and immune avoidance. Liquid biopsy based on targeted sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has also made it possible to identify patients who have tumors that harbor mutations associated with increased Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.  This project comprises a phase 2 biomarker clinical trial to prospectively evaluate these specific embodiments of PET/CT and liquid biopsy as tools for detecting HCC recalcitrant to ICI therapy on the basis of beta-catenin activation. In addition to characterizing and comparing the predictive capabilities of FCH PET/CT and cfDNA mutation profiling based on phase 2 clinical endpoints, this project will utilize decision tree based machine learning to estimate the predictive performance of an integrative imaging-genomic biomarker while also further examining how tumor mutations are related to PET metabolic phenotype and immunotherapy response. Furthermore, because tumor 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake is incongruent with FCH uptake in HCC, a third aim will utilize the trial as a molecular screening process to create an enriched sub-cohort of patients with FDG-avid tumors. These patients will undergo serial FDG PET/CT to evaluate FDG as a source of predictive biomarkers of ICI response for an orthogonal molecular sub-type of HCC. If these diagnostic tests are found reliable at predicting tumor resistance/response, they could significantly enhance the clinical precision and overall benefit of immunotherapy for HCC and possibly other cancers. PROJECT NARRATIVE  While immune-checkpoint inhibitor antibodies are a major advance in cancer treatment, only a minority of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (the most common form of primary liver cancer) will benefit from this form of immunotherapy. This project comprises a phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate positron emission tomography/ computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging and DNA sequencing based liquid biopsy as diagnostic tools for predicting resistance to immunotherapy in hepatocellular carcinoma. The goal is to determine whether using these tests can potentially increase a patient’s chance of receiving a drug that will help them.",Evaluation of treatment predictors reflecting beta-catenin activation in hepatocellular carcinoma,10277385,R01CA262460,"['Biological Markers', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communication', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'DNA sequencing', 'Decision Trees', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Effectiveness', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'FDA approved', 'Genes', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Immune checkpoint inhibitor', 'Immunotherapy', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Induced Mutation', 'Learning', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Metabolic', 'Microsatellite Instability', 'Minority', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutate', 'Mutation', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oncogenic', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phase II Clinical Trials', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Primary Malignant Neoplasm of Liver', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Refractory', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Transcription Coactivator', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Treatment outcome', 'Tumor Escape', 'Tumor Markers', 'United States', 'Woman', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'advanced disease', 'anti-PD-1', 'anti-PD-L1', 'antibody inhibitor', 'base', 'beta catenin', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cancer therapy', 'cell free DNA', 'checkpoint therapy', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'cohort', 'determinants of treatment resistance', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'genomic biomarker', 'imaging agent', 'imaging biomarker', 'immune-related adverse events', 'improved', 'liquid biopsy', 'melanoma', 'men', 'metabolic phenotype', 'migration', 'molecular subtypes', 'mortality', 'mutational status', 'neoplastic cell', 'next generation sequencing', 'objective response rate', 'predictive marker', 'predictive tools', 'programmed cell death ligand 1', 'programmed cell death protein 1', 'programs', 'prospective', 'response', 'screening', 'targeted sequencing', 'tool', 'transcriptomics', 'tumor', 'tumor DNA', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression', 'uptake']",NCI,QUEEN'S MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,520008
"Supplemental transmission aided attenuation correction for high performance quantitative PET imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Quantitative tracer images from combined PET-CT and PET-MR are increasingly being utilized for radiological decision-making and clinical trials. CT and MR based data corrections for PET photon attenuation, typically the largest impact on tracer quantification, can lead to increased radiation dose to the subject or require lengthy additional dedicated MR scans, respectively. Artificial intelligence algorithms that use the PET signal originating from the subject alone to estimate attenuation have shown promising early results, but, can have reduced performance when applied to exams different from the training data. Reconstruction methods that jointly estimate both the measured attenuation and tracer contrast from the subject PET signal represent a viable alternative, but, to date, have failed to match the quantification of CT approaches. Consequently, no single approach for PET attenuation correction that consistently produces high quantification and does not compromise patient safety or throughput currently exists. This is an important problem, since research and clinical findings must balance these practical issues with data quality. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and characterize a high performance attenuation correction scheme that utilizes both the PET signal from the subject and a variable activity external source. The central hypothesis is that the proposed reconstruction method will have significantly improved performance over reconstruction algorithms using PET signal originating from the subject alone, independent of the imaging study. The two specific aims include: 1) developing and validating a supplemental transmission-based algorithm for correcting PET images for photon attenuation during commercial PET imaging and 2) prototyping and characterizing a device capable of dynamically varying external source activity. The result of Aim 1 will be a reconstruction algorithm that is optimized to produce quantitative PET data for some of the most common clinical PET studies. Under Aim 2, a prototype device that can repeatability vary the external source activity in order to maximize tracer quantification while minimizing the unavoidable degradation to patient tracer image noise, caused by the introduction of any external source, will be produced. The innovation is an attenuation correction strategy that greatly mitigates the limitations of previous joint reconstruction methods to deliver quantitative PET diagnostics that are expected to match those of silver standard CT approaches. This is significant because the number of patients receiving brain and cardiac PET-CT scans, exams the proposed method is expected to benefit, is steadily increasing. For PET-MR, the method may improve tracer quantification where MR has limited performance and increase patient throughput by eliminating the need for non-diagnostic attenuation-only MR acquisitions. Thus, the proposed strategy has great potential to significantly improve radiological decision- making and clinical trial findings that rely on quantitative PET uptake measurements. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to the public health because the development of a PET radiotracer attenuation correction strategy that is independent of the exam type, has the potential to improve the strength of research and clinical findings based on quantitative PET measurements. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of NIBIB's mission that pertains to enhancing existing imaging and bioengineering modalities.",Supplemental transmission aided attenuation correction for high performance quantitative PET imaging,10222671,R03EB028946,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Brain', 'Calibration', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Equilibrium', 'Equipment', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering', 'Neuroendocrine Tumors', 'Noise', 'Oncology', 'PET/CT scan', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Scattering', 'Radioactive', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silver', 'Source', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Tube', 'attenuation', 'base', 'data quality', 'experimental study', 'fluorodeoxyglucose', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'patient safety', 'pediatric patients', 'prototype', 'radiotracer', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'transmission process', 'uptake']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R03,2021,86474
"Accuracy and Precision in CT Quantification of COPD Through Virtual Imaging Trials Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of death. Increasing in prevalence, COPD is a major burden to patients and providers. Computed tomography (CT) can provide valuable information about the structural and functional abnormalities of the disease as demonstrated in numerous studies where quantitative CT is deployed to characterize and evaluate the treatment. For instance, the COPDGene study has recently shown the substantial role of quantitative CT in the redefinition of COPD diagnosis, and in evaluating the progression of emphysema over time. However, these biomarkers vary across different scanners, settings, and patient attributes. There is a crucial need to manage this variability by optimizing and harmonizing CT images for reliable biomarker quantifications across both current and emerging scanners. This goal is not possible through conventional methods of using physical phantoms or patient images. Physical phantoms are often oversimplified and not representative of the complex anatomy and physiology of COPD patients. Patient images are ground-truth-limited, i.e., the exact anatomy and physiology of the patient is not fully known. Further, patient-based comparisons require multiple acquisitions of the same subjects across different scanners and settings. This is not ethically possible since repeated imaging increases the absorbed radiation dose. These challenges can be overcome through the use of virtual imaging trials (VITs) where studies are performed in silico using computational models of patients and scanners. VITs can provide reliable and practical solution to the challenge of COPD imaging provided realistic models of patients and scanners. Such models are currently lacking in the context of COPD. We develop and then utilize realistic virtual imaging toolsets to systematically evaluate and optimize CT biomarkers in COPD patients across scanners, imaging parameters, and patient attributes. We develop the first library of realistic COPD patient models with diverse attributes and severities. Coupled with accurate models of different scanners, the phantoms will be used to generate sets of ground-truth-known virtual CT cases, to be disseminated to the research community and to be used to systematically evaluate the effects of current and emerging scanners, various patient attributes, and the effects of image processing algorithms (through a national challenge), on the accuracy and precision of COPD biomarkers. Further, we develop and optimize a truth-based artificial intelligence-based algorithm for COPD quantifications. We optimize the algorithm for accuracy and reproducibility, taking advantage of the ground-truth known simulated images . We then harmonize CT settings across different scanners to accurately and precisely assess COPD imaging biomarkers for both single time-point and longitudinal studies. The studies will be done for the top two image processing algorithms, identified in the challenge, as well as our developed algorithm. Through these efforts, the project will position CT as a more reliable method for improved characterization and monitoring of COPD. Narrative The project aims to systematically evaluate and optimize quantitative CT imaging biomarkers in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients, across scanner makes and models, imaging parameters, and patient attributes. This will be performed by developing and using in silico models of COPD patients and CT scanners.

"Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction Nuclear medicine imaging in children has been shown to have significant clinical value across all organ systems. In providing this significant benefit it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that of adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. The governing principle of this project will be to minimize radiation dose while methodically ensuring that lesion detection performance is fully preserved. This will be accomplished by using validations based on both numerical and physician observers measuring performance in tasks that emulate those performed clinically. We will employ two approaches in tandem to enable lowering dose while maintaining performance. First, we will use advanced image reconstruction and processing techniques. Corrections for various forms of image quality degradation will be incorporated in the reconstruction, and deep learning (DL) will be used for post-reconstruction denoising. Second, we will develop methods to correct for both body and respiratory motion, which degrade diagnostic accuracy. Correcting for body and respiratory motion will allow dose to be reduced without loss of image quality and will also offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to minimize motion when imaging children. For this investigation we have selected 99mTc-labeled dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal imaging as a testbed to demonstrate our approaches. Damage to the renal cortex resulting from infection of the kidneys is a critical issue in children, including newborns and toddlers. DMSA SPECT is the “gold-standard” in the evaluation of pyelonephritis and renal scarring post- infection. The concepts we will demonstrate for reduction of radiation dose and correction of motion with DMSA will be translatable to other SPECT (and PET) studies in pediatric imaging and beyond.  Our Specific Aims are: 1. Establish infrastructure for investigating and evaluating advanced reconstruction and motion correction; 2. Determine the extent of radiation dose reduction to pediatric patients through improved reconstruction and DL denoising while maintaining optimal full-dose lesion detection accuracy; 3. Develop data-driven and depth-sensing camera methods for body and respiratory motion estimation and correction; and 4. Conduct numerical and physician observer studies to validate the level of dose reduction enabled by DL denoising and motion correction. Narrative  In nuclear medicine imaging, it is critical to minimize the radiation dose used in pediatric patients, whose risk for adverse health effects (such as cancer) per unit administered activity is much higher than that in adults, owing to their higher tissue sensitivity and longer potential lifespan. Correcting for body and respiratory motion occurring during imaging will improve the quality of the formed three-dimensional images of the patient by reducing blurring and image artifacts and offer a technological alternative to using sedation or even general anesthesia to reduce motion when imaging children, which can bear health risks of its own. We propose an advanced reconstruction methodology which would enable reduction in the amount of activity administered and compensate for patient motion during imaging.",Improving Pediatric SPECT Imaging: Enhanced Lesion Detection with Dose Reduction through Advanced Reconstruction and Motion Correction,10168531,R01EB029315,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'DMSA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Dose', 'Enhancing Lesion', 'Ensure', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Freedom', 'Gaussian model', 'General Anesthesia', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging problem', 'Infection', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Kidney', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Longevity', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Newborn Infant', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Pyelonephritis', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Respiration', 'Risk', 'Scheme', 'Sedation procedure', 'Societies', 'Statistical Study', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toddler', 'Ursidae Family', 'Validation', 'base', 'body system', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinically significant', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'denoising deep learning', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'innovation', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney infection', 'molecular imaging', 'pediatric patients', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'renal scarring', 'respiratory', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NIBIB,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,724046
"Prism-PET: A TOF-DOI-Compton PET detector technology for total-body PET imaging Abstract  The relatively small axial field-of-view (FOV) in almost all PET scanners has severely limited their sensitivity and resulted in significant tradeoffs between image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), acquisition time, and delivered dose. The solution is to improve geometric coverage using large axial FOV for total-body imaging which has the potential to improve sensitivity by about 40 times compared to existing commercial whole-body PET scanners. The construction of the world's first total-body PET/CT scan-ner, called EXPLORER, with 194-cm axial FOV has recently been completed. However, it has a poor time-of-flight (TOF) resolution of 430 ps, compared to the state-of-the-art whole-body PET scanner with 200 ps timing resolution (Siemens Biograph Vision). In addition, axial detector penetration of obliquely incident gamma photons detected within this wide acceptance angle will introduce significant depth-of-interaction (DOI) parallax error, leading to degraded spatial resolution. These two major defi-ciencies of the EXPLORER scanner offset its effective sensitivity gain, specially for imaging single organs such as the human brain when compared to the Biograph Vision PET scanner. For this research, we propose to build cost-effective block detectors with combined highest spatial resolution (2 mm), highest TOF resolution (<120 ps and potentially 100 ps), best DOI localization (1.85 mm), and highest inter- crystal Compton scatter recovery capabilities (88%) using single-ended readout and machine learning post-processing engines. Our novel detector module, called Prism-PET, enables these capabilities by mimicking very closely the behavior of dual-ended readout with enhanced and controlled light sharing using a segmented array of right angle prism-mirror light guides. Given our promising preliminary ex-perimental results, we aim to accomplish the following tasks: (1) model a prototype TOF-DOI PET scanner using GATE Monte Carlo simulations and use its list-mode data to develop our TOF-DOI image recontruction; (2) build Prism-PET detector modules and characterize coincidence detector blocks for DOI-corrected spatial resolution, energy resolution, and timing resolution and use machine learning to recover inter-crystal Compton scattered events to reach the 2-mm intrinsic spatial resolution without sacrificing sensitivity; (3) Build a one-ring prototype Prism-PET scanner; (4) perform normalization scan, optimize our image reconstruction using experimental coincidence events and validate the optimal imaging performance using Hot Spot phantoms. Our proposed TOF-DOI-Compton detector and system technologies maximize the sensitivity benefits of improved geometric coverage in total-body PET scanners across the entire FOV. Narratives/Relevance  The EXPLORER total-body PET scanner has limitations due to its poor timing resolution and lack of DOI-encoding, both of which offset its effective sensitivity gain, specially for imaging single organs, despite the very costly improvement of its geometric coverage. In the proposed work we will develop cost-effective and practical single-ended TOF-DOI-Compton PET detector modules, where these capabilities are enabled by using our novel right an-gle prism mirror light guides which enhance (1) light sharing by efficient 180-degree bending of photon paths and (2) crystal identification by localiz-ing the shared photons to only those immediate neighboring pixels that help with the correct identification. Our Prism-PET scanner with < 120 ps timing resolution, 1.85 mm DOI-encoding, and 88% Compton-scatter recovery miti-gates the limitations with the EXPLORER total-body scanner and achieves unparalleled spatial resolution and sensitivity.",Prism-PET: A TOF-DOI-Compton PET detector technology for total-body PET imaging,10233306,R01EB030413,"['Architecture', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Caliber', 'Calibration', 'Collaborations', 'Compton radiation', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Crystallization', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Dose', 'Electronics', 'Elements', 'Event', 'Floods', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Hot Spot', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Industrialization', 'Length', 'Light', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'PET/CT scan', 'Pattern', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Photons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rotation', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Silicon', 'Source', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vision', 'Work', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'detector', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'novel', 'performance tests', 'photomultiplier', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'risk mitigation', 'simulation']",NIBIB,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2021,647165
"Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies Project Abstract Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) continues to play a critical role in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease (CAD). While conventional SPECT scanners using parallel-hole collimators are still the foundation of cardiac SPECT, recently our field observed an exciting growth of new developments of dedicated cardiac scanners. Such dedicated scanners, such as the GE Alcyone 530/570c systems and the D-SPECT systems both with CZT detectors, typically have multiple detectors collecting photons emitted from the heart simultaneously, leading to dramatically improved sensitivity (2-5 X). In addition, the GE systems use pinhole collimators and can achieve much higher resolution. These dedicated scanners opened doors to new applications with significant clinical impact, including ultra-low-dose imaging, absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), high resolution molecular imaging, multi-isotope imaging, motion correction, and many more. Most of these new applications are uniquely achievable only using dedicated scanners. While the dedicated cardiac SPECT systems can improve clinical practice and lead to numerous new clinical applications, such systems are far from being optimized to fully realize their great potentials. In this grant, we propose to systematically develop and optimize innovative imaging technologies for the GE 530/570c systems to further improve its clinical efficacy in a variety of significant ways. In Aim 1, we will develop and optimize methods for static cardiac SPECT imaging. We will develop various deep learning methods and investigate approaches to increase angular sampling to reduce noise, and improve resolution and quantitative accuracy. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate methods for dynamic SPECT imaging, particularly involving direct parametric image reconstruction. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate methods for dual-isotope SPECT. Monte Carso simulation and deep learning based methods will be developed for tracers with different spatial distributions and fast kinetics. In all three aims, large animal studies and human subject data will be used for optimization and validation. Narrative The success of imaging technology developments proposed in this grant will substantially improve the image quality, reduce patient dose, expand the applications of cardiac SPECT from mainly static imaging to dynamic imaging, and establish multi-isotope clinical imaging.",Development of advanced cardiac SPECT imaging technologies,10221049,R01HL154345,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloidosis', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac', 'Charge', 'Clinical', 'Collimator', 'Computed Tomography Scanners', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'DCNU', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Infarction', 'Isotopes', 'Kidney', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microspheres', 'Molecular Target', 'Monte Carlo Method', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myopathy', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Study Subject', 'System', 'Tail', 'Toxic effect', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Validation', 'animal data', 'attenuation', 'base', 'cardiac single photon emission computed tomography', 'clinical application', 'clinical efficacy', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'detector', 'efficacy evaluation', 'human subject', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'molecular imaging', 'new growth', 'parametric imaging', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'simulation', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'success', 'technology development']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,805251
