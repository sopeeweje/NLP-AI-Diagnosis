"Examining feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of a novel personalized smartphone intervention for suicide. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is a serious public health concern in the United States. However, despite an increase in theoretical models of and treatments for suicide, the suicide rate has risen 33% since 1999. Given the widespread availability of smartphone technology, there is great potential to deliver interventions via mobile platforms. However, despite the proliferation of smartphone tools for suicide, few offer evidence-based support and some include potentially harmful content. In response, we have conducted initial development of a mobile suicide prevention system: Mobile Application to Prevent Suicide (MAPS). MAPS was specifically designed to identify increased suicide risk and deliver personalized intervention for patients transitioning out of a psychiatric hospital, a time of extraordinarily high risk. MAPS provides both a mobile app and clinician support, and includes multiple evidence-based components: (1) monitoring of thoughts, emotions, and behaviors via ecological momentary assessment (EMA), (2) personalized, interactive coping strategy administration based on participants’ current risk state, (3) direct access to clinicians and crisis support services, and (4) psychoeducation. We will leverage existing components of MAPS and develop and test new features. To plan for sustainability of MAPS, we will deliver the intervention through the Butler Hospital Transitional Outpatient Program, assigning participants to master’s level hospital clinicians, and convene a Stakeholder Advisory Board with a focus on program sustainability. Specifically, the primary aim of this investigation is to establish feasibility, acceptability, safety, and estimate key parameters for primary outcomes (i.e., suicidal ideation and behavior; re-hospitalization), and target mechanisms (i.e., self-monitoring, use of coping strategies, reduction of negative affect, self-efficacy). The ultimate goal of this project is to further develop and refine the MAPS system and engage in preliminary testing in preparation for a fully-powered randomized clinical trial (R01) to establish effectiveness of the intervention in a larger health care system and to further optimize intervention components and delivery (e.g., machine learning techniques). This proposal outlines procedures for intervention and clinician training program refinement through focus groups and open and randomized pilot trials. Thus, the present study is designed to develop the tools, procedures, and knowledge base for a novel intervention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicide is a major public health problem, with over 47,000 deaths by suicide per year, and individuals discharged from psychiatric hospitals are at extraordinarily elevated risk for suicide. Currently available treatments for suicide have not led to a decrease in the suicide rate. The primary aim of the present study is leverage existing infrastructure to develop novel technological features for a novel personalized smartphone intervention system, and to establish feasibility, acceptability, safety, and estimate key parameters for primary outcomes (i.e., suicidal ideation and behavior; re-hospitalization), and target mechanisms.","Examining feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability of a novel personalized smartphone intervention for suicide.",10107455,R34MH124971,"['Admission activity', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cellular Phone', 'Cognition', 'Coping Skills', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Effectiveness', 'Effectiveness of Interventions', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emotions', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Focus Groups', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Moods', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Preparation', 'Prevention strategy', 'Privacy', 'Procedures', 'Professional Practice', 'Program Sustainability', 'Provider', 'Psychiatric Hospitals', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Self Efficacy', 'Services', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training Programs', 'United States', 'Visit', 'Work', 'acceptability and feasibility', 'age group', 'base', 'behavioral health', 'care systems', 'clinical practice', 'coping', 'cost', 'critical period', 'design', 'effectiveness study', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'falls', 'health care service', 'high risk', 'hospital readmission', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'mobile application', 'mobile computing', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'outpatient programs', 'personalized care', 'personalized intervention', 'pilot trial', 'primary outcome', 'psychoeducation', 'readmission rates', 'recruit', 'response', 'sensor', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'therapy development', 'tool']",NIMH,"BUTLER HOSPITAL (PROVIDENCE, RI)",R34,2021,236986
"Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting ABSTRACT Significance: As recent national controversy over Joint Commission mandates proves, universal suicide risk screening in emergency departments (ED) will not achieve widespread adoption because confusion remains around which specific risk indicators to assess, and clinicians fear that such screening will lead to massive surges in psychiatric evaluations. To address these two implementation barriers, the proposed study will derive a clinical decision rule to support universal risk detection and optimize patient care workflow in adult patients. Investigators: The Project Team has extensive expertise in ED-based suicide risk screening and assessment (Boudreaux, Larkin), clinical decision rule design (Boudreaux, Stiell), predictive analytics (Wang, Liu, Simon), machine learning and informatics (Liu, Simon), industrial engineering (Johnson), and healthcare economics (Clements). A Clinical Advisory Panel ensures that the proposal is grounded in the practical realities of the ED. Innovation: The proposed study will be the first to apply industry standards for deriving decision rules to suicide risk and will directly inform the controversy regarding the relative strengths and weaknesses of universal versus targeted screening. We will pioneer new statistical innovations for rule derivation and will integrate simulation of potential workflow impact using industrial engineering modeling and economic analyses. Approach: We have already developed a pool of empirically supported, clinician-acceptable candidate suicide risk indicators. Data on these candidate indicators will be collected by trained research staff on 500 adult medical patients and 500 adult psychiatric patients from a large ED. Participants will undergo a comprehensive suicide risk assessment by a research clinical psychologist blinded to the indicators who will assign the participant to a criterion reference risk group: Negligible, Mild-Moderate, or High risk. Participants will be followed for 24 weeks after the visit to assess suicidal behavior, our secondary outcome. In Aim 1, we will derive a universal screening decision rule for “all comers,” as well as a variant to be used with patients presenting with a psychiatric chief complaint (targeted). In Aim 2, we will test whether a previously validated risk stratification algorithm using data from the electronic health record improves the performance of the decision rules. In Aim 3, we will model the potential operational impact of the rules through dynamic modeling of clinical workflow and economic costs and assessing clinician and patient acceptability in a new sample of 100 ED clinician-patient dyads. Environment: UMass has demonstrated its capability to support this study through several key preliminary studies, including the ED-SAFE studies, System of Safety, and other suicide-related studies set in the ED. Impact: By providing clear, evidence-based recommendations on universal screening and optimized workflow using standards accepted by emergency clinicians, this study will address two pivotal barriers to universal suicide risk screening, transforming the “right thing” into the “easy thing” so it becomes the “usual thing.” NARRATIVE Effective prevention of suicide among adult emergency department (ED) patients hinges on two indispensable components: effective identification of all patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior, and successful delivery of effective interventions to those with risk. Because many ED patients have hidden risk and do not present with psychiatric chief complaints, universal screening has been recommended by several prominent groups, such as the Joint Commission and the Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention; however, two trenchant barriers prevent such universal screening from being widely implemented, namely, (1) lack of clarity around the specific indicators to use for screening and (2) fear that screening all-comers will cause ED workflow to come to a grinding halt because of surges in psychiatric evaluations and boarding. The proposed study will address these two barriers by deriving the first clinical decision rule for use with all ED patients using rigorous standards and procedures and modelling its impact on workflow and costs, thereby revolutionizing the field's ability to actualize the first indispensable component of suicide prevention: effective, efficient identification and triaging of suicide risk, both hidden and obvious.",Deriving a Clinical Decision Rule for Suicide Risk in the Emergency Department Setting,10083111,R01MH118220,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Blinded', 'Blunt Trauma', 'Cervical spine', 'Clinical', 'Confusion', 'Consultations', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Economic Models', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department Physician', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency Department-based Intervention', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Emergency Nursing', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Funding', 'Healthcare', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Industry Standard', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Interview', 'Joints', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nurses', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Psychologist', 'Published Comment', 'Research', 'Research Assistant', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Safety', 'Sampling', 'Screening Result', 'Self-Direction', 'Stratification', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Sum', 'System', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Triage', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visit', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'common rule', 'cost', 'design', 'economic cost', 'economic evaluation', 'effective intervention', 'electronic data', 'evidence base', 'evidence based guidelines', 'health care economics', 'high risk', 'implementation barriers', 'improved', 'indexing', 'inferential statistics', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'prevent', 'risk stratification', 'screening', 'secondary outcome', 'simulation', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,R01,2021,814463

"Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior Abstract/Project Summary  The suicide rate among young adults aged 18-25 has risen to the highest level in more than 30 years, yet our ability to accurately predict suicide attempts remains limited to distal, static risk factors. There is an urgent need for research to identify ways to assess who is most at risk for suicide in the near future, consistent with Aspirational Goal 3 of the National Action Alliance’s Prioritized Research Agenda. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this R01 from an Early Stage Investigator is to improve our ability to identify specific near-term, dynamic within-person processes that predict acute increases in a vulnerable individual’s risk for suicide. Social processes related to affiliation and attachment (e.g., social rejection or exclusion), as well as painful and provocative events (PPE; e.g., violent trauma and self-injury), are well-known distal risk factors for suicide. However, the role of dynamic cognitive-affective and biological responses to experiences of rejection for predicting near-term suicide risk in any individual is poorly understood. In addition, it is not known how the influence of rejection-related processes on near-term suicide risk may vary as a function of distal risk factors such as exposure to PPE. The current application outlines a multimethod intensive longitudinal study to examine dynamic affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term risk factors for temporal fluctuations in suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STB) over the course of hours to days, weeks, and months. We will also examine exposure to PPE as a moderator that amplifies intraindividual reactivity to social rejection, thereby further increasing suicide risk. Participants will include a diagnostically diverse clinical sample of 150 young adult men and women (ages 18 to 35) with clinically significant STB in the past 4 months. Multimodal assessments at baseline will include a 21-day random and event-based ecological momentary assessment (EMA) protocol; laboratory paradigms with psychophysiological measures, self-reports, and assessment of implicit suicide-related cognition; and interviews using timeline follow-back (TLFB) methods. Assessments at 4-month intervals over the course of 12 months will include repeated laboratory tasks, physiological and implicit assessments, self-reports, and TLFB interviews to assess changes in responses to rejection, PPE, and STB over time. The proposed project has three specific aims: (1) Examine multimodal measures of within- individual affective and physiological responses to rejection as near-term, prospective predictors of within- person fluctuations in STB over time; (2) Examine exposure to PPE as between-persons distal moderators of within-person processes leading to near-term increases in STB at the individual level; and (3) Apply machine learning techniques to identify combinations of multiple time-varying within-person processes and static between-person differences that are most predictive of suicide risk over time. Results of this study will lead to advances in suicide risk assessment, identification of novel points of intervention, and development of personalized interventions to prevent suicide attempts among vulnerable individuals. Project Narrative Suicide is a serious public health problem that ranks as the second leading cause of death in adults under age 35. This research will contribute to our ability to better predict suicidal behavior in the near term, having direct implications for suicide risk assessment, risk stratification, and personalized intervention approaches aimed at reducing and preventing suicide.",Multimodal Assessment of Near-term Risk Processes for Suicide Ideation and Behavior,10054973,R01MH115922,"['Acute', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Arousal', 'Assessment tool', 'Back', 'Biological', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Distal', 'Ecological momentary assessment', 'Event', 'Exclusion', 'Exposure to', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hour', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Interview', 'Laboratories', 'Life', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Self-Direction', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sinus Arrhythmia', 'Social Environment', 'Social Processes', 'Standardization', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Techniques', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Trauma', 'Violence', 'Withdrawal', 'Woman', 'Work', 'aged', 'base', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'improved', 'individual response', 'men', 'multimodality', 'negative affect', 'novel', 'person centered', 'personalized intervention', 'physical abuse', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'reducing suicide', 'respiratory', 'response', 'risk stratification', 'social', 'social exclusion', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,670430
"Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder Project Summary/Abstract Prevention of suicidal behavior, especially among patients with mood disorders, is of uttermost importance among mental health professionals. Patients with bipolar disorder (BD), which affects around 1-2% of the population, are at a particularly high risk for developing suicidal behavior, with 25-50% of patients making at least one suicide attempt in their lifetime. In addition, although there is evidence that BD and suicide share a genetic risk and that stress may play a key role in suicidality, the mechanisms by which some patients are more vulnerable to suicidal behavior than others are vastly unknown. Guided by strong preliminary data, we hypothesize that epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, may underlie suicide risk among BD patients. Moreover, DNA methylation markers may provide clinically-relevant biomarkers for the identification of patients at highest risk for suicidal behavior. These hypotheses will be tested by completing three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will characterize DNA methylation alterations with the latest-generation Illumina MethylationEPIC BeadChip 850K platform in a discovery sample of neurons isolated from post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissues from patients with BD that committed suicide or died of other causes and controls. Promising markers will be validated by oxidative bisulfite pyrosequencing and further explored by pathway analyses. In Aim 2, we will investigate the coordinated changes between genetic risk for BD and suicide attempt and DNA methylation alterations in post-mortem prefrontal cortex using the same cohort as Aim 1 and a replication cohort from the UTHealth Brain Collection for Research in Psychiatric Disorders. In Aim 3, we will analyze the clinical correlates of methylome markers of suicide in an independent cohort of adult patients with BD that have previously attempted to commit suicide or not, compared to healthy controls, from which a comprehensive dataset with demographic, clinical, and neuroanatomical data is available, as well as genome-wide methylation and genotyping data. Specific targets and pathways predicting suicidal behavior will be further explored by sophisticated statistics and bioinformatics tools while controlling for co-variables known to associate with suicidal risk, followed by the development of machine learning algorithms for the prediction of suicidality at the individual level. Of note, the overarching goal of this K01 is to further the PI’s expertise in the biology and clinical aspects of suicide, bioinformatics, post-mortem analyses, and epigenomics, which will ensure a methodologically strong foundation to launch an independent lab in psychiatric epigenetics. Importantly, a strong group of mentors and collaborators with a remarkable track record in training junior faculty has been selected to provide intellectual and technical input during the award period. In addition, the outstanding resources, facilities, and multidisciplinary scientific community at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and the Texas Medical Center represent an ideal environment to ensure that the PI accomplishes his research and career objectives. This proposal is well aligned with the mission of the NIMH, and it will not only provide the PI with crucial training required to his transition to full independence, but also address important, testable questions regarding the poorly understood risk for suicide among BD patients and the lack of specific tools for the identification of vulnerable subjects. Project Narrative Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder significantly increasing its risk possibly due to a shared genetic and epigenetic risk. However, there are no clinically-useful biomarkers available for the prediction of suicidality in patients and very little is known about the molecular mechanisms of suicide in this disorder, which limits our ability to provide targeted prophylactic interventions for susceptible subjects. Here we propose to conduct a multidisciplinary translational study to identify a clinically-relevant DNA methylation biosignature to predict suicidal behavior in bipolar disorder patients and its association with clinical and neuroanatomical parameters.",Deciphering the role of neuronal and peripheral DNA methylation in suicide and bipolar disorder,10165832,K01MH121580,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Autopsy', 'Award', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Cause of Death', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Enzymes', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Faculty', 'Fluorescence', 'Foundations', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health Professional', 'Health Sciences', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Masks', 'Mediating', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methylation', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurons', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stress', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Testing', 'Texas', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'bead chip', 'bioinformatics tool', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'biomarker identification', 'biosignature', 'bisulfite', 'career', 'cell type', 'clinical biomarkers', 'clinically relevant', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'completed suicide', 'epigenomics', 'genome wide methylation', 'genome-wide analysis', 'high risk', 'machine learning algorithm', 'methylation biomarker', 'methylome', 'methylomics', 'mortality', 'multidisciplinary', 'peripheral blood', 'polygenic risk score', 'prediction algorithm', 'prophylactic', 'pyrosequencing', 'statistics', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'translational study']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,K01,2021,174843
"Advancing Maryland's Statewide Suicide Data Warehouse to Improve Individual and Population-level Mortality Prediction and Prevention ❖ PROJECT SUMMARY In 2018, NIMH funded the development of the Maryland Suicide Data Warehouse (MSDW). The aim of developing MSDW was to link a diverse set of data sources and use various layers of risk factors to predict suicide death on a generalizable population. Currently, MSDW includes data on ~5+ million Maryland residents spanning from 2012 to 2017. MSDW contains hospital and emergency discharges, health information exchange (HIE) data, commercial insurance claims, medical examiner data, electronic health record (EHR) data from 5 select health systems, and place-based social determinants of health data covering various domains such as housing, employment, education, income and crime. This study will leverage the unique data types linked by MSDW to improve suicide death predictions among generalizable patient populations. Our proposed study will further expand the underlying data and develop cutting-edge use cases of MSDW. The study aims to achieve a number of outcomes: (1) Acquire refreshed data from all existing MSDW data sources; (2) Use the wide array of data sources stored in MSDW to advance the prediction of suicide mortality, while controlling for data quality and potential model bias; (3) Explore various uses cases of the MSDW such as unsupervised clustering of suicide mortality cases; and, (4) Collaborate with external investigators to validate the MSDW-derived predictive models of suicide death. ❖ PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Suicide is a major preventable public health challenge.

"Developing Suicide Risk Algorithms for Diverse Clinical Settings using Data Fusion Suicide is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States. Recent evidence indicates that many if not most of individuals who die by suicide have been in contact with the healthcare system in the months prior to their death, providing data that can be used to identify patients at risk prior to an attempt. The proposed project will develop an innovative method for identifying patients at risk of suicidal behavior using data from a large multistate health information exchange, integrated with data from the State of Connecticut’s CHIME hospital database. We will develop and test suicide risk algorithms using principles associated with transfer learning, in which information from a comprehensive external data source is used to improve prediction in a more limited dataset. Specifically, we will use multimodal data fusion techniques to develop and test algorithms that can identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior by clinicians in hospitals with limited numbers of patients, select patient populations, and lack of access to outpatient data. This approach is not only generalizable to hospitals throughout the US but can be extended to very diverse clinical settings, e.g., primary and specialty care practices, community health centers, urgent care clinics. The potential public health significance of this study is substantial. The fragmentation of the healthcare system, particularly in relation to patients’ behavioral health needs, highlights the critical need to cultivate comprehensive, system-wide approaches to identifying and managing at patients at risk of suicide. Narrative Suicide is one of the most serious public health problems facing the United States.

"Passive Assessment of Behavioral Warning Signs for Suicide Risk in Adolescents: An Idiographic Approach PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and the rates have doubled since 2000. The rise in suicide rates is due in part to a failure to identify short-term risk factors for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Additionally, most existing research relies primarily on group-level methodological approaches to suicide risk assessment; intraindividual suicide risk processes are largely neglected. Because of the lack of knowledge on short-term and individual-level suicide risk, it remains unclear when and how to intervene with the individual adolescents who need it most. Three particularly promising observable, state-sensitive, temporally delimited, and modifiable proximal indicators of suicide risk among adolescents are social engagement, sleep, and physical activity. Although acute changes in these behavioral processes are often denoted as imminent “behavioral warning signs” of suicide, most existing research has examined these behavioral factors only as distal predictors and correlates of suicide risk. Importantly, their contribution to short- term risk using individual-level approaches (i.e., fully idiographic, “n-of-1” methods) remains unknown. The Candidate’s proposed K23’s overarching goal is to employ mobile sensing and actigraphy to assess whether objectively and passively measured acute behavioral changes from typical patterns of social engagement, sleep, and physical activity indicate proximal risk for increases in suicidal ideation using idiographic n-of-1 models in high-risk adolescents. It further aims to characterize the intraindividual network structure of these behavioral factors and suicidal ideation to enhance suicide risk assessment and guide intervention. Adolescents (N=100) admitted to an inpatient or partial hospital program due to acute suicide risk will be recruited. For a period of 3 months, wearable actigraphs will be used to assess adolescents’ sleep and physical activity and mobile sensing will be used to assess adolescents’ digital social engagement and patterns of movement to approximate additional indices of physical activity. Once-daily mobile surveys will be used to assess suicidal ideation. The proposed training plan complements the Candidate’s research plan and will facilitate training in: conducting translational digital health research in high-risk adolescents, passive mobile sensing, passive adolescent sleep and physical activity assessment via actigraphy, and advanced computational approaches to person-specific intensive data modeling. A team of leading scholars will provide expert mentorship to facilitate the Candidate’s training goals within the highly resourced environment of the Alpert Medical School of Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital. The proposed study will promote the Candidate’s long-term career goal to employ low-burden and scalable methods of assessment to develop personalized risk models that will improve the proximal prediction of suicide risk and inform intervention for youth. Through the execution of this research and training plan, the Candidate will be positioned to become a leader in the field of adolescent suicide. PROJECT NARRATIVE Suicide is the second leading cause of death among adolescents and the rates have doubled since 2000. The goal of the present study is to develop personalized risk models of adolescent suicidal ideation based on passive and objective data sources (using wearables and smartphone sensors indexing social engagement, sleep, and physical activity).

"The Role of Sleep Health in Proximal Suicide Risk among Ultra-High Risk Adolescents ABSTRACT Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people age 14–24, and rates in this age group are increasing. Most suicide risk factors are distal (i.e., long-standing, static), thus informative regarding who is at risk, but not when. As such, our ability to reliably predict near-term suicide risk among vulnerable populations remains grossly inadequate. Studies consistently demonstrate a link between subjective sleep disturbances and the continuum of suicidality. Yet, sleep is a complex behavior that can be measured along multiple dimensions and at varying levels of analysis. Furthermore, little attention has been paid to the role of normative biological and psychosocial developmental processes that further contribute to dynamic changes in risk related to sleep disturbance. Such changes in sleep are particularly dramatic during adolescence. Studies also have not examined how sleep interacts with other known pathways, such as dysregulation in affective, cognitive and arousal-related systems, to lead to suicidality in vulnerable youth. We thus propose to conduct an 8-week prospective multi-method study of sleep health and suicidal thoughts and behavior in a transdiagnostic sample of ultra-high risk adolescents (14-18) who have recently enrolled in an Intensive Outpatient or Partial Hospitalization Program. We will capitalize on the extant clinical and research infrastructures to compare sleep-suicide associations and plausible affective, cognitive and arousal-related mechanisms using self-report, behavioral, lab task paradigms and physiology in adolescents at ultra-high risk for suicide. Project Narrative Despite the enormous public health problem of suicide among adolescents, little progress has been made toward improving assessment and prevention for this vulnerable group. We will conduct a prospective, longitudinal study to examine the near-term temporal associations between within-person fluctuations in sleep disturbance, dysregulation in affective, cognitive and arousal-related systems, and changes in suicidality over time in ultra-high risk adolescents. Critically, since sleep is a modifiable risk factor, our findings hold great promise to inform the development or modification of existing sleep/mental health interventions to lower suicide risk.",The Role of Sleep Health in Proximal Suicide Risk among Ultra-High Risk Adolescents,10107391,R01MH124907,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Affective', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'American', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral inhibition', 'Biological', 'Cardiac', 'Cause of Death', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Reporting', 'Day Care', 'Development', 'Developmental Process', 'Dimensions', 'Distal', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Emotional', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Moods', 'Outpatients', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Physiology', 'Prevention', 'Prevention strategy', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'System', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Work', 'Youth', 'actigraphy', 'age effect', 'age group', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'biopsychosocial', 'clinical infrastructure', 'cognitive control', 'cost', 'design', 'diaries', 'heart rate variability', 'high risk', 'high-risk adolescents', 'improved', 'innovation', 'modifiable risk', 'mood symptom', 'outpatient programs', 'poor sleep', 'programs', 'prospective', 'psychosocial', 'sleep behavior', 'sleep health', 'sleep quality', 'sleep regulation', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,766370
"Leveraging deep learning and clinical notes for surveillance and prediction of intentional self-harm and suicide PROJECT SUMMARY: Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with more than 47,000 individuals dying by suicide each year. The identification of individuals at risk for suicide is an important step for a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention. Despite extensive research on risk factors for intentional self-harm and suicide, prospective prediction of suicide remains a difficult task with poor predictive power. Recent studies suggest that new machine learning methods applied to electronic health records (EHR) show promising results. However, more advanced computational approaches such as deep learning, have not been fully leveraged in this field, especially in the area of advanced methods for text classification of clinical notes. Our aims in this project, are to improve the phenotyping of suicidal behavior, and the prediction of future suicidal behavior and suicide deaths by integrating mortality data with EHR data and leveraging state-of-the-art natural language computational approaches. We will also investigate methods for explain ability and interpretability of the models to improve future adoption by clinicians. We will validate our models by examining reproducibility and generalizability across two health systems using similar data at both sites. Project Narrative Suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, with more than 47,000 individuals dying by suicide each year. In this project, we plan to improve the identification of patients at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior, by linking mortality data with electronic health records data and using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence such as deep learning.

"Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over 44,000 people died by suicide in the U.S. in 2016 and national rates continue to increase. The majority of people who died by suicide had contact with the health care system in the year prior to their death. Major hurdles to implementing suicide prevention in healthcare settings include the lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training routine healthcare providers in suicide prevention. Innovations in machine learning and artificial intelligence may overcome these hurdles as it is now possible for technology to assess the quality of provider skill in intervention delivery and provide opportunities for skill acquisition and practice. The candidate's long-term goal is to harness technological advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of training among general medical providers in suicide prevention. The proposed research and training activities will take place at the University of Washington at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, WA, a county safety-net hospital and level I trauma center serving patients across Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. The research aims to adapt and deploy existing scalable technology to train frontline trauma center providers (e.g., nurses) to collaboratively engage patients in a suicide safety planning intervention (SPI) and conduct a pilot feasibility trial of the resultant training. Aim 1 includes focus groups with trauma nurses to identify individual, setting, and organizational-level implementation barriers and facilitators based on the Theoretical Domains Framework and inform strategies for engaging nurses in training and delivery of the SPI with patients. Aim 1 also includes the user-centered design method of contextual inquiry, including task analysis, with nurses to inform workflow- integration. Aim 2 includes user-centered design methods to identify technology refinements and adaptations based on nurse preferences to increase usability. The technologies are a 1) conversational agent, with simulated patient role-play and real-time feedback, and 2) AI-based feedback of counseling performance from SPI audio recordings. Aim 3 is to conduct a pilot randomized trial of a technology-enhanced provider training as compared to a web-based didactic only condition. The longitudinal trial will include 20 nurses (10 per condition), each with 3 patients, and support submission of an NIMH R01 full-scale trial. The K23 training goals include building knowledge and skills in 1) technology-focused team science, 2) the application and integration of implementation science, user-centered design, and adult learning theory for technology adaptation and integration for nurse training, 3) acute care suicide prevention clinical trials research, including the responsible conduct of research with patients at-risk for suicide, and statistical methods for low base-rate outcomes and nested longitudinal clinical trials data. This K23 application addresses the NIMH Strategic Plan by developing strategies incorporating information technology and pragmatic feedback systems for suicide prevention efforts in real-world practice, reaching the full breadth of patients presenting to the health care system after injury. PROJECT NARRATIVE Each year in the United States approximately 30 million individuals require emergency department visits; 1.5- 2.5 million are so severely injured that they require inpatient hospitalization and over 650,000 patients present for self-inflicted injury. Acute care medical settings, such as emergency departments and inpatient trauma units, present critical opportunities for suicide prevention, which is stymied by a lack of scalable and sustainable methods for training providers in high quality suicide prevention interventions. The proposed K23 harnesses advances in artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and machine learning to improve the scalability and sustainability of suicide prevention training among acute medical care providers to better reach the population of patients at-risk for suicide with potentially life-saving interventions.",Technologic Innovation to Enhance the Scalability and Sustainability of Trauma Center Provider Training in Suicide Safety Planning,10210226,K23MH118361,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Alaska', 'American', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Counseling', 'County', 'Data', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Dissemination and Implementation', 'Effectiveness', 'Emergency department visit', 'Empathy', 'Enhancement Technology', 'Feedback', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Focus Groups', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Services', 'Health behavior change', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Idaho', 'Individual', 'Information Technology', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical center', 'Mental Health Services', 'Methods', 'Montana', 'Motivation', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Needs Assessment', 'Nurses', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Partnership Practice', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prevention approach', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Provider', 'Randomized', 'Recommendation', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Priority', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Savings', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Strategic Planning', 'Suicide', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Technology', 'Theoretical Domains framework', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Trauma Nursing', 'Trauma patient', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Wyoming', 'acute care', 'base', 'care providers', 'college', 'computerized', 'coping', 'evidence base', 'feasibility trial', 'health care settings', 'implementation barriers', 'implementation science', 'implementation strategy', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'motivational enhancement therapy', 'patient population', 'preference', 'prevention clinical trial', 'psychosocial', 'randomized trial', 'recruit', 'responsible research conduct', 'safety net', 'screening', 'severe injury', 'skill acquisition', 'skills', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'task analysis', 'technological innovation', 'theories', 'trauma care', 'trauma centers', 'trauma units', 'usability', 'user centered design']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2021,150756
"Using Search Engine Data for Detection and Early Intervention in Suicide Prevention ABSTRACT. Decades of research to improve the prevention and early detection of suicide risk has largely resulted in the detection of who is most likely to consider suicide, but not when or if that is most likely to happen. Most detection methods presume patients are in contact with the healthcare system, which only reaches a proportion of the at-risk population. Many people at high risk for suicide do not seek professional help because of lack of time, stigma, and fear regarding how they will be treated in the health care system. It is imperative that we develop methods that can identify proximal risk for suicide that does not depend on system- level contact. Web-based search tools are ubiquitous, with 46% of the global population using the internet for information searches and 1.2 trillion searches per year worldwide. Based on our preliminary data, we propose that this online search-engine behavior may prove to be an effective, private, and immediate method of proximal risk detection of suicide for anyone, regardless of their contact with systems of care. We will recruit 1,000 people with mental illness with varying risk for suicide. Participants will provide us access to Google Take-Out (GTO) data, which includes search-engine history and behavior including YouTube. Participants will include those who have report a suicide attempt in the past year (N=500), those who have made an attempt over a year ago (N=250), and those who have thoughts of suicide but never attempted (N=250). All will participate using gold-standard suicide behavior research instruments. Using a case-crossover design, we will evaluate the intermittent exposures (search based proximal risk factors) with an immediate and transient effect on risk and an abrupt outcome (suicide attempt). The case-crossover design is a well-tested and proven approach especially in cases where transient events can trigger acute events such as cardiovascular events, injuries, and death due to environmental exposures and has been studied with interview data to determine warning signs for suicide attempts. Further for predicting suicidal attempt/s, we will use robust ensemble-based machine learning methods such as random forest, gradient boosting to evaluate the predictive nature of qualitative and quantitative features. The study will conclude in a collaborative dissemination planning process with our community partners. Thus, this retrospective and prospective study that aligns GTO data with carefully assessed suicidal thoughts and behaviors has the potential to identify warning signs in search and YouTube data that predict when suicidal risk and lay the groundwork for innovative pathways to suicide prevention. Narrative. Online search-engine behavior (Google and YouTube) may be an effective, private, and immediate method of suicide risk detection for anyone, regardless of their contact with systems of care. In this study, participants who made a suicide attempt in the past year (N=500), those who have made an attempt but over a year ago (N=250), and those who have thoughts of suicide but never attempted (N=250) will complete gold- standard research assessments of suicidal thoughts and behavior and provide Google Take-Out Search and YouTube data. Using a case-crossover design, we will identify and evaluate proximal risk factors in search- engine behavior; that is, patterns that change at the time of suicidal behavior or increases in suicidal ideation and lay the groundwork for ethical, feasible, and acceptable online interventions that can be deployed immediately when suicide risk is high.",Using Search Engine Data for Detection and Early Intervention in Suicide Prevention,10207109,R01MH123484,"['Acute', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Ethics', 'Event', 'Facebook', 'Family', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Foundations', 'Friends', 'Fright', 'Future', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Inpatients', 'Internet', 'Interview', 'Knowledge', 'Length', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Online Systems', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention', 'Primary Health Care', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Services', 'Standardization', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Surveys', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Twitter', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'care systems', 'cohort', 'cost', 'detection method', 'digital', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'improved', 'information seeking behavior', 'innovation', 'instrument', 'machine learning method', 'mortality', 'online intervention', 'predictive tools', 'prevention service', 'prognostic signature', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'screening', 'search engine', 'social media', 'social stigma', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal risk', 'tool', 'volunteer']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,876668
"Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY). Abstract: The emergency assessment of acute suicidal risk in adolescents is a daunting clinical challenge because our current ability to predict suicide attempts is weak, and because the risk for suicide attempts in suicidal adolescents is high. Nevertheless, there have been no studies that have examined the best approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in suicidal youth presenting to a psychiatric emergency department (PED). To address this research gap, we propose a study of 1800 youth presented to a regional PED, 1350 of whom present for evaluation of suicidal risk, in which youth are assessed in the PED, and followed up at 1, 3, and 6 months to determine which youth have made a suicide attempt. We propose 3 complementary approaches to assessment of suicidal risk. First, in this competitive renewal, we build on our success in developing computerized adaptive tests for 6 diagnostic groups, plus suicidal risk, during our previous project period. These self- and parent-reports can be completed in a total of 10-15 minutes. Second, because theory-driven assessments of suicide risk have strong predictive power in adults, but have never been tested prospectively in adolescents, we propose to test the predictive power of measures of Shneidman’s psychache (mental pain) and Joiner’s Interpersonal Theory of Suicide, which posits interactive roles of perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belonging, and acquired capacity for suicide in driving suicidal risk. Third, we aim to use machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) of electronic health records (EHRs) to identify youth at risk for suicide attempts. We hypothesize that each of these approaches: (1) CATs for suicide risk and for depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD, oppositional defiant, and conduct disorders); (2) theory-derived measures of suicidal risk; and (3) ML and NLP of EHRs, will each be superior to clinical assessment alone in the prediction of attempts, and that the combination of the 3 approaches will be more powerful than any one of these approaches alone. This study is innovative because it is one of the first to use CATs for the prediction of suicidal risk, in a consistently high risk population, the first prospective test of two leading theories of suicide in adolescents, the first to use machine learning and natural language processing to identify EHR predictors of suicide attempts in adolescents, and the first to test a combination of approaches to the identification of imminent suicidal risk in adolescents in a sufficiently large, high risk sample. The study is of potentially high impact because it could identify brief, easily disseminated assessment strategies to identify youth at high risk for suicidal behavior and add to clinicians’ ability to match intensity and type of resources to those at greatest clinical need. The approaches to be tested in this study could yield assessments that reflect the two imperatives of emergency mental health care: brevity and accuracy. With better ability to identify who is at risk for suicidal behavior, we will be in a much stronger position to identify who needs intervention and reverse the disturbing, decade-long trend of increases in adolescent suicide and suicidal behavior. Project Narrative: This study will test the individual and conjoint predictive ability of three approaches to the prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents seen in a psychiatric emergency room. These three approaches, namely, computerized adaptive testing, assessment of transdiagnostic risks from the perspective of two leading theories of suicide, and use of natural language processing and machine learning to identify predictors of suicidal behavior found in electronic health records, have to potential to be much briefer and more accurate than current clinical approaches to the assessment and prediction of suicidal behavior in adolescents. Therefore, this project has the potential to greatly improve our ability to identify youth at highest risk for suicidal behavior and to match the intensity and type of treatment to those with the greatest clinical need.","Harnessing Computerized Adaptive Testing, Transdiagnostic Theories of Suicidal Behavior, and Machine Learning to Advance the Emergent Assessment of Suicidal Youth (EASY).",10164860,R01MH100155,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anxiety', 'Area Under Curve', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Automobile Driving', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Child', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Conduct Disorder', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Situation', 'Emergency department visit', 'Evaluation', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Healthcare', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Intake', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Oppositional Defiant Disorder', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positive Valence', 'Psyche structure', 'Psychometrics', 'Psychopathology', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Social support', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Symptoms', 'Telephone', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Youth', 'adolescent suicide', 'aged', 'base', 'child depression', 'computerized', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'improved', 'innovation', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'prospective test', 'psychiatric emergency', 'recruit', 'risk prediction', 'success', 'suicidal', 'suicidal adolescent', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'theories', 'tool', 'trend']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,718829
"Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Improving Suicide Prediction using NLP-Extracted Social Determinants of Health Suicide is among the leading causes of death worldwide and among United States Veterans in particular. Current methods of risk assessment are limited in their ability to accurately identify patients who are at the highest risk of suicide. The overarching goal of this proposal is to strengthen suicide prediction efforts by gaining a more granular understanding of the association between social determinants of health and suicide risk. Social determinants of health (SDH) refer to the conditions in which people are born, live, work, and age. A number of SDH are known risk factors for suicide. While SDH could be obtained from the structured EHR data, their scope is limited. A recent study has shown that EHR notes contain about 90 times more information about SDH than the structured data. To address this gap, we propose a stepwise approach that leverages the power of EHR and new computational methdologies to explore associations between natural language processing extracted SDH and suicide ideation, attempt and death. This approach is critical to the development of next- generation suicide prevention tools.

"Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals Project Summary Bereaved individuals, especially those who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) and those bereaved by suicide, have substantial risk of suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide. These vulnerable bereaved subgroups are also less likely to receive informal support or access mental health care, creating a pressing need to detect their suicide risk. Each year, well over a thousand unsolicited bereaved individuals visit our Cornell Center for Research on End-of-Life Care website and complete an online tool to determine if they meet criteria for PGD (over 6,000 completers to date). Compared to community-based bereaved samples, those who complete our online tool disproportionately meet criteria for PGD (e.g., ~30% vs. ~10%) and are suicide bereaved (~10% vs. ~2%). Thus, astoundingly, >35% of those who visit our Center website and complete our online diagnostic tool are at significantly elevated risk for suicidal ideation and/or attempts. To respond to the need to detect suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) among our bereaved website visitors, we propose to develop a web-based tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk. We will leverage our Living Memory Home, an online memorial application residing on our Center website, by enhancing its features to optimize data collection, including data on potential implicit indicators of a bereaved person's suicide attempt risk (Aim #1). Data will be gathered on 100 Living Memory Home users daily for a week, followed by a 1-week, 1- and 6-month post-baseline follow-up assessment. The study will generate ~30 texts/subject in the Living Memory Home's Imagined Dialogues with the deceased, and reflections, dreams, stories, and touchstones in Narrative Notes (~3,000 texts in total from all users). Boot-strapping resampling, natural language processing and machine learning techniques will then be applied to develop machine learning models predicting suicide attempt risk based on bereaved subjects' baseline, 1-week, 1- and 6-month Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale scores (Aim #2). Our primary outcome will be the 1-week CSSRS score. We will, thus, develop and then pilot test an automated way to detect bereaved persons'; suicide attempt risk based on their interactions with the Living Memory Home. This is a first step toward development of a safe, accurate, potentially scalable online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals. Project Narrative (Relevance) Bereaved individuals, and particularly those bereaved by suicide and who meet criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder, are at substantially elevated risk for suicidal thoughts and attempts. This project, applying machine learning techniques to detect suicidal attempt risk among bereaved individuals using an online bereavement resource, the Living Memory Home, is a first step in the development of a safe and effective online tool for the detection of suicide attempt risk among bereaved individuals.",Automated Detection of Suicide Attempt Risk among Bereaved Individuals,10077375,R21MH121886,"['Behavioral', 'Bereavement', 'Caring', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dreams', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Grief reaction', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Linguistics', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Persons', 'Reaction', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Training', 'United Kingdom', 'Visit', 'base', 'end of life care', 'expressive writing', 'follow up assessment', 'follow-up', 'help-seeking behavior', 'informal support', 'loved ones', 'metropolitan', 'predictive modeling', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'recruit', 'skills', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide model', 'tool', 'web site', 'web-based tool']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2021,206083
"Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually. Despite ongoing efforts to reduce the burden of suicide and suicidal behavior, rates have remained relatively constant over the past half century. Attempts to predict suicidal behavior have relied almost exclusively on self-reporting of suicidal thoughts and intentions. This is problematic because of well-known reporting biases and the fact that many people at high risk are motivated to deny suicidal thoughts to avoid hospitalization. Even though the majority of all suicide decedents have contact with a healthcare professional in the month before their death, suicide risk is rarely detected in such cases. Efforts to identify risk factors have also been stymied by the fact that suicide is a low-base rate event so that very large samples are needed to test the complex combinations of factors that are likely to contribute to risk. The widespread adoption of longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) has created a powerful but still under-utilized resource for detecting and predicting important health outcomes. In prior work using machine learning methods to analyze structured EHR data, we have developed predictive models that detect up to 45% of first-episode suicidal behavior, on average 3 years in advance. Here we aim to systematically extend and improve our EHR prediction methods in a large healthcare system (N = 4.6 million patients) by incorporating 1) external public record datasets (LexisNexis SocioEconomic Health Attribute data) that include environmental, socioeconomic, and life event information; 2) natural language processing (NLP) to leverage unstructured EHR text, including text-based scores that capture RDoC domains; 3) a novel method of deriving temporal risk envelopes to capture the time-dependent effects of individual risk factors; and 4) clinical risk trajectories that incorporate ordered temporal sequences of risk factors. We will systematically compare the performance of each of these approaches to identify optimal strategies for enhancing risk surveillance and prediction in healthcare settings. Completion of these aims would represent a crucial step towards novel, clinically deployable, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior. Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for more than 40,000 deaths annually, with 1.4 million attempting suicide annually. Unfortunately, efforts to identify those at high risk have had limited success. We have previously used machine learning methods to predict risk of suicidal behavior using the vast resources of data available in electronic health records. The proposed research will extend and improve this work by leveraging external datasets, medical record notes, and trajectories of risk over time to facilitate novel, clinically relevant, and potentially transformative tools for improving outcomes for those at risk for suicide and suicidal behavior.",Improved multifactorial prediction of suicidal behavior through integration of multiple datasets,10149408,R01MH117599,"['Accounting', 'Adoption', 'Calibration', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chronology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Event', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Information Resources', 'Intervention', 'Legal', 'Life', 'Link', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Outcome', 'PF4 Gene', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical risk', 'clinically relevant', 'data resource', 'discrete time', 'electronic structure', 'feature extraction', 'health care settings', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'machine learning method', 'markov model', 'multiple datasets', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'process repeatability', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'sociodemographics', 'socioeconomics', 'structured data', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'tool']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,501430
"Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention One hundred and twenty-three Americans die by suicide every day, and 800,000 individuals die from suicide globally every year. Five times as many people attempt suicide and 10-25 times as many contemplate suicide every year. Rates of suicidal thoughts or ideation and suicidal behaviors are increasing. Suicidal ideation alone causes mental and physical harm and is associated with worsened statuses of other illnesses. Suicidal ideation is often documented by clinical providers in their notes but has been shown to only be included in diagnostic or billing codes 3% of the time. Historical suicide attempts are also under- captured by billing codes alone. Improving identification of those with suicidal ideation and attempts might enhance prevention through earlier contact with those at risk.  A growing literature shows that clinical predictive models with longitudinal electronic health records (EHR) can predict suicide attempts with good performance. These models have also been used by groups like ours to improve power of large-scale genetic analyses of suicide attempt risk. The investigators used their validated models to identify the signal for suicide attempt, a “phenotype”, to run genetic analyses showing suicide attempt risk is 4% heritable. This team also showed that suicide attempt risk was significantly genetically correlated with depressive symptoms, neurotic symptoms, and schizophrenia.  The investigators propose to validate a phenotype of suicidal ideation and to improve their existing phenotypes of attempt risk to power large-scale genetic analyses across two major biobanks, Vanderbilt’s BioVU and the UK Biobank. They will use natural language processing (NLP) and analytics on Vanderbilt’s EHR to develop and test a phenotype of suicidal ideation. They will use NLP to improve capture of cases of suicide attempt to refine existing algorithms. They will apply these phenotypes at scale to BioVU. Their Stanford team members will use patient-reported suicidal ideation histories in another major biobank, UK Biobank, to independently run genetic analyses of suicidal ideation risk in a different population. They will further analyze clinical and genetic risk factors to better understand who will transition from suicidal ideation to suicide attempt.  The project combines expertise in clinical informatics, machine learning, and large-scale genomics, as well as domain-specific expertise in suicide risk research. Spanning two major biobanks across two countries, the algorithms and methods developed have maximal portability, facilitating next-step investigations. Successful identification of suicidal ideation and attempt risk might inform clinical prevention. Better understanding of risk factors that predict who will proceed from suicidal ideation to suicidal behaviors would help allocate prevention resources to those who need them most. Project Narrative  Suicide is one of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States and 10-25 times the number that die contemplate suicide every year. Large gaps remain in our understanding of genetic risk factors of suicidal ideation and attempt as well as genetic and clinical risk factors that contribute to transition from ideation to attempt. This investigation will use natural language processing, machine learning, electronic health records for over 1 million people, and two major biobanks from the United States and the United Kingdom to study the clinical and genetic risk factors necessary to improve identification of patients at highest risk of suicidal behaviors.",Distinguishing Clinical and Genetic Risk of Suicidal Ideation from Attempts to Inform Prevention,10061648,R01MH121455,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Behavior', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Code', 'Country', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Family Study', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heritability', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predictive Factor', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Preventive', 'Provider', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Work', 'algorithmic methodologies', 'base', 'biobank', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical predictors', 'clinical risk', 'comorbidity', 'depressive symptoms', 'design', 'epidemiology study', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genetic risk factor', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'improved', 'member', 'open source', 'outcome prediction', 'phenotyping algorithm', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'risk stratification', 'structured data', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'trait']",NIMH,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,543736
"Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related behaviors PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Key focus: Research leveraging EHR data (PAR-18-929) to prevent suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) Objectives: To use augmented Veterans Health Administration (VHA) EHR data to develop Personalized Treatment Rules (PTRs) to help guide clinicians in making key treatment decisions for mentally ill patients aimed at reducing SRBs over the next 12 months. Specific aims: We will focus on two decisions: the decision of primary care physicians on how to treat patients coming to them for help with common mental disorders (CMD; “the PCP study”); and the decision of VHA Suicide Prevention Coordinators on whether to hospitalize patients who just made nonfatal suicide attempts or treat them as outpatients (“the SPC study”). Both are recognized as critical decisions, with no globally optimal treatment path for either and little guidance on how to decide among the treatment options. Research design: We will use a prospective observational design. The PCP study will be based on EHR data for the roughly 583,000 incident PCP visits of VHA patients for help with a CMD in 2010-2016. An incident visit will be defined as where the patient had not received other CMD treatment in the prior 12 months. The five broad PCP treatment options are pharmacotherapy, referral to psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy plus measurement based collaborative care, and referral to a psychiatrist. The outcomes will be either an SRB (the primary outcome, either suicide death or administratively-recorded nonfatal suicide attempt) over the next 12 months or psychiatric hospitalization with suicidality over the same follow-up period (the secondary outcome). These outcomes occurred after 12,292 2010-2016 incident visits. The SPC study will be based on the 67,196 2010-2016 VHA Suicide Behavior Reports completed after a nonfatal VHA outpatient suicide attempt. Roughly half of these cases were hospitalized and the others treated as outpatients. A repeat SRB occurred over the next 12 months for 19,829 of these cases. Methods: A best-practice method of balancing baseline covariates will be used to adjust for nonrandom assignment across treatment options. Baseline covariates will include: prior EHR data; EHR data available for the focal treatment decision, including information abstracted from clinical notes with natural language processing; small-area geocode data for patient addresses; individual-level data from the LexisNexis Social Determinants of Health Database on patient finances, employment, marital status, and criminal justice involvement; and information about prior practice patterns of treating clinicians and practices-resources of treatment settings. A cutting-edge ensemble machine learning method will be used to analyze these weighted data to develop PTRs. Cross-validation in the 2010-2016 data and validation in 2017-2018 data (not available until the third year of the study) will be used to estimate out-of-sample performance of the PTRs. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop precision treatment rules for (i) primary care physicians trying to develop a treatment plan for patients seeking treatment for common mental disorders and (ii) suicide prevention coordinators trying to develop a treatment plan for a patient who just made a nonfatal suicide attempt with the goal of developing a plan that will minimize prevalence of suicide-related behaviors (either suicide deaths or nonfatal attempts) over the next 12 months. The work will be carried out in the Veterans Health Administration system, but will have implications for the broader population. The research has the potential to have great public health significance given that suicide-related behaviors (SRBs) are important public health problems, that the decisions we will study occur very often and have important effects on SRBs, that clinicians currently have no clear guidance on how to make these decisions, and that the design we propose to use has a high probability of success because of a number of important advantages over the designs used in previous studies.",Leveraging EHR data to evaluate key treatment decisions to prevent suicide-related behaviors,10075983,R01MH121478,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Ambulatory Care', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Case Management', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child Rearing', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Criminal Justice', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Death Records', 'Decision Making', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Employment', 'Equilibrium', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Homelessness', 'Hospitalization', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intake', 'Integrated Health Care Systems', 'Link', 'Marital Status', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentally Ill Persons', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Observational Study', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Prevalence', 'Primary Care Physician', 'Probability', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychotherapy', 'Public Health', 'Randomized', 'Reaction', 'Records', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Suicide prevention', 'System', 'Trauma', 'Validation', 'Veterans Health Administration', 'Visit', 'Work', 'base', 'care providers', 'case-by-case basis', 'clinical practice', 'collaborative care', 'common treatment', 'comparative treatment', 'completed suicide', 'design', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'ideation', 'indexing', 'machine learning method', 'optimal treatments', 'personalized medicine', 'primary outcome', 'prospective', 'reducing suicide', 'response', 'secondary outcome', 'social health determinants', 'success', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicide rate', 'treatment effect', 'treatment planning', 'treatment trial', 'unethical', 'virtual']",NIMH,HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,R01,2021,771357
"Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data PROJECT ABSTRACT Suicide is one of the leading causes of death. As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. While white males between 45 and 64 years of age are 4 times more likely than females to die by suicide, females attempt suicide 3 times as often as males. Recent data suggest that there are 20 times as many suicide attempts, which is generally considered a high and consistent risk factor for subsequent suicide. However, predicting and monitoring when someone will attempt self-harm and suicide has been nearly impossible. In this project, we plan to leverage large-scale, integrated electronic health record and claims from the New York City Clinical Data Research Network to study the suicidality in relation to emergency department (ED) visits or hospitalizations. In particular, using data on >10 million patients, we will develop novel NLP and machine learning models to identify patients at highest risk for self-harm, suicide attempt and suicide, and conduct a pilot study to assess the clinical utility of such models. We will also conduct a validation study using similar data from Kaiser Permanente Washington. PROJECT NARRATIVE As of 2015, annual age-adjusted suicide rate in the U.S. is 13.26 per 100,000 individuals, and on average, there are 121 suicides per day. Successful identification of patients who are at the risk of self-harm, suicide attempt, and suicide can lead potential clinical interventions for improving patient outcomes. This proposal will apply “big data” techniques to identify patients at risk of suicidal behavior using large-scale integrated clinical data.","Predicting Self-Harm, Suicide Attempt, and Suicidal Death using Longitudinal EHR, Claims and Mortality Data",10116483,R01MH119177,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Address', 'Admission activity', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Big Data', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Caring', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Decision Support Systems', 'Code', 'Data', 'Death Certificates', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Emergency Department patient', 'Emergency department visit', 'Emotional', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Female', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health system', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intervention', 'Judgment', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Medicine', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'New York City', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Presbyterian Church', 'Race', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Project Grants', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Self-Injurious Behavior', 'Services', 'Site', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Text', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Washington', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'data registry', 'demographics', 'detection method', 'health care service utilization', 'high risk', 'implementation study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insurance claims', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'model design', 'mortality', 'novel', 'point of care', 'portability', 'predictive modeling', 'psychiatric emergency', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'social', 'stressor', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'suicide rate', 'validation studies']",NIMH,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2021,686186
"Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior ABSTRACT: The assessment of suicidal risk is critical for treatment planning and monitoring of therapeutic progress for suicidal individuals. Current standard-of-care relies on patient self-report and clinician impression, which are not strongly predictive of imminent suicidal risk. This project advances a highly innovative approach to the assessment of suicidal risk, by using machine-learning detection of brain activation patterns that are neural signatures of individual concepts that have been altered in suicidal individuals. The overarching goal is to establish reliable neurocognitive markers of suicidal ideation (SI) and attempt (SA) in individual participants, and to assess these measures’ ability to predict future ideation and attempts. In previous work, this approach was applied to the fMRI-based neurosemantic signature (NSS’s) during the thinking about each of 30 words related to either to suicide, negative concepts, or positive concepts in 17 SI young adults and 17 healthy controls (HCs). A machine learning classifier was able to discriminate between the SI and HCs with 91% accuracy, based on differential brain activation patterns in the L superior medial frontal cortex and anterior cingulate, areas known to be involved in self-referential thinking. Within the ideators, NSS’s also discriminated between those with a history of a SA from those without such a history with 94% accuracy. Moreover, using the classification algorithm derived from this sample, we were able to accurately classify a second sample of suicidal individuals with 87% accuracy. It was also possible to assess the emotions differentially manifested during the thinking about these words, and thus to differentiate SI from HC with 85% accuracy, and SI with and without SA with 88% accuracy. On the basis of these promising pilot findings, we propose to study 300 young adult SI (about half of whom will have made a SA), 100 never-suicidal psychiatric controls, and 100 HCs, use fMRI to assess NSS at intake and 3 months, and assess for suicidal ideation and behavior at intake, 3, 6, and 9 months thereafter. The goals are to determine if: (1) NSS’s are sensitive to changes in level of suicidal ideation when repeated at 3 months; and (2) whether NSS can predict trajectories of suicidal ideation and behavior upon prospective follow-up. We will also examine the relationship between NSS activation of circuits related to self-referential thinking and the death/suicide Implicit Association Test (IAT) that examines the extent to which a person associates suicide-related concepts with self. Finally, as a translational goal, we aim to develop and test a neurally based IAT that examines associations of suicidal concepts with self and with emotions as informed by NSS findings. This study, by shedding light on alterations in suicidal individuals’ neural representation of suicide-relevant concepts could be extremely useful for: (1) identification of those with suicidal ideation who may not self-report their level of risk; (2) monitoring fluctuations in suicidal risk over time; (3) identification of emotional states associated with suicidal ideation; (4) guiding therapy to mitigate these alterations; and (5) the prediction of future suicidal ideation and behavior. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project takes a novel approach to the study of suicidal risk by examining the differences in brain activation patterns between suicidal and non-suicidal young adults when thinking about concepts related to suicide, negative, and positive emotions while undergoing neuroimaging. We use modern computing techniques called machine learning to identify brain activation patterns that differentiate suicidal and non-suicidal individuals and that can help to predict future suicidal ideation and behavior and will develop an easy-to-use computer test based on these brain activation studies that we hope will also be predictive of future suicidal ideation and behavior. If this project is as successful as our preliminary work, it will advance clinical practice by improving clinicians’ ability to: (1) detect and monitor suicidal risk, (2) understand alterations in thinking and feelings related to suicide in their patients; and (3) develop personalized treatment strategies for their suicidal patients based on their altered patterns of thinking and feeling that can more precisely and effectively reduce suicidal risk.",Imaging the Suicide Mind using Neurosemantic Signatures as Markers of Suicidal Ideation and Behavior,10130001,R01MH116652,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Computers', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Feeling', 'Feeling suicidal', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Implicit Association Test', 'Individual', 'Intake', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurocognitive', 'Participant', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Pilot Projects', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Shame', 'Suicide', 'Suicide attempt', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'cingulate cortex', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical practice', 'design', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'ideation', 'impression', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning classifier', 'longitudinal design', 'neural patterning', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'positive emotional state', 'predictive test', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'standard of care', 'suicidal', 'suicidal behavior', 'suicidal individual', 'suicidal morbidity', 'suicidal patient', 'suicidal risk', 'treatment planning', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,728998
