"Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach Project Summary Renal transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end stage renal disease. However, improvements in long-term allograft survival have not matched the observed improvements in the management of rejection. Progressive allograft dysfunction is frequently encountered clinically. The final common pathway of cumulative and incremental renal damage from several etiologies identified by histopathology is interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), which is associated with progression of renal dysfunction and reduced allograft survival. Histopathologic assessment and staging of IFTA requires tissue sampling, which is limited due to its invasive nature, risk of complications, inter-individual variability and sampling error. In this proposal, we will test a non-contrast advanced multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) protocol comprised of advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1) and advanced diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) as noninvasive markers of renal allograft fibrosis. This is motivated by our preliminary data demonstrating that mpMRI yields highly repeatable parameter measurements that capture allograft fibrosis. Our preliminary experience correlating mpMRI with IFTA is valuable, as confounding physiologic and pathophysiologic variables such as vascular flow, edema and other Banff phenotypes commonly co-exist. The multiparametric approach allows us to simultaneously capture and characterize these concurrent physiologic and pathophysiologic processes. As a secondary objective, we will assess the value of urinary RNA level based biomarkers, which have been previously validated for the diagnosis of IFTA. In this proposal, we aim to: 1) acquire data in patients undergoing indication and surveillance biopsy, using a non-contrast mpMRI protocol comprised of advanced diffusion weighted and relaxometry methods in order to accurately detect and stage allograft IFTA, and 2) other histopathological Banff measures of inflammation. We will build and validate diagnostic models using advanced statistical methods including machine learning in independent model-building and validation sets of renal transplant patients for detection and staging of each Banff measure, and assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of fibrosis. 3) We will evaluate the performance of mpMRI and urinary biomarkers to predict renal outcomes in a longitudinal study for the entire patient cohort up to 24 months. Our long-term objective is to validate a robust quantitative advanced mpMRI approach and develop models that accurately and non-invasively measure renal allograft fibrosis and clinical outcome, which may potentially impact the care of renal transplant patients by enabling early detection, the non-invasive longitudinal monitoring of disease, therapeutic efficacy of new drugs and for prognostication. Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach Project Narrative Caused by a variety of etiologies, acute and chronic renal allograft injury often results in the development of interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy (IFTA), is a significant cause of allograft failure and poor outcomes; the reference standard for which is tissue biopsy, which is limited due to sampling error and risk of complications. In this proposal, we will develop a short, non-contrast multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) protocol, consisting of advanced relaxometry (T1 mapping and T1) and advanced diffusion weighted imaging (IVIM-DWI) to accurately detect and stage allograft fibrosis, taking into account confounding Banff variables of inflammation and tested against biopsy. We will also assess the added value of urinary biomarkers of IFTA and if successful, this study will benefit a large population of patients with renal allograft fibrosis in the United States, enabling early diagnosis, optimized treatment planning, prognostication and longitudinal disease monitoring.",Characterization of Renal Allograft Fibrosis and Prediction of Outcome Using a Quantitative MRI Approach,10279690,R01DK129888,"['Acute', 'Affect', 'Allografting', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collagen', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'End stage renal failure', 'Endothelium', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Histopathology', 'Immune', 'Immunosuppression', 'Infection', 'Infiltration', 'Inflammation', 'Injury', 'Injury to Kidney', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Transplantation', 'Lesion', 'Living Donors', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Proteinuria', 'Protocols documentation', 'RNA', 'Reference Standards', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Risk', 'Sampling Errors', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Statistical Methods', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tubular formation', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical encounter', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'comparative', 'diffusion weighted', 'experience', 'feature selection', 'improved', 'insight', 'inter-individual variation', 'interstitial', 'kidney allograft', 'kidney biopsy', 'kidney dysfunction', 'macromolecule', 'model building', 'mortality', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'post-transplant', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'renal damage', 'secondary outcome', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment planning', 'urinary', 'virtual']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,625886
"MR Fingerprinting for Epilepsy Abstract Epilepsy affects 65 million people worldwide; approximately 30% of them do not respond to medications but can be cured by surgery. Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a major pathology for medically intractable epilepsies, is frequently missed by visual analysis of the conventional MRI, making surgical treatment very difficult. We propose to develop a novel quantitative MRI acquisition and analysis framework specific for epilepsy patients, which could provide more sensitive and specific measures of brain structure, thereby improving FCD detection and subtype prediction. To this end, the quantitative framework will be developed and validated in three steps: (1) Develop high-resolution Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) scan that allows simultaneous quantification of multiple tissue property maps efficiently, accurately and precisely. These quantitative maps have shown to be more sensitive and specific on detecting and characterizing subtle signal abnormalities. (2) Develop image post-processing methods to analyze quantitative maps, which will provide quantitative measurements that highlight additional morphological features, such as gray-white boundary blurring, abnormal cortical thickness and folding. (3) Develop machine-learning-based feature screening and prediction tools to characterize group-level features differentiating FCD subtypes, and predict individual-level FCD location and subtyping. Because detection and subtype prediction of FCD are both associated with seizure outcomes, epileptologists can use this tool to provide more personalized and customized counseling. The result of our proposed work promises a paradigm shift by converting the current standard-care of visual/qualitative MRI review to a quantitative framework, including data acquisition, post-processing and decision support tool, that would eventually lead to better treatment planning, reduction in unnecessary pre-surgical evaluation tests (especially invasive evaluation), and improved post-operative seizure outcomes in patients with devastating and disabling medically intractable epilepsy. The quantitative nature of our acquisition/analysis methods also makes it possible to be uniformly adopted by other centers with high consistency.

"In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging ABSTRACT Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology, a primary protein abnormality in the rare diseases amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is now recognized as a common age-related neuropathology, detected at autopsy in approximately 50% of older persons. According to recent evidence, TDP43 pathology in aging is associated with more rapid cognitive decline and higher odds of dementia, above and beyond contributions from Alzheimer’s and other age-related neuropathologies. In spite of its high frequency and deleterious effects, TDP43 can only be diagnosed at autopsy, and there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging. The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging by combining multimodal MRI and pathology in the same older persons from large community cohorts. Specifically, we propose to a) train TDP43 classifiers using machine learning based on ex- vivo MRI measurements of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical brain characteristics of older persons, b) translate these classifiers in-vivo, and c) test them in-vivo using longitudinal clinical, in-vivo MRI, and pathology data on older adults enrolled without dementia. We have generated a unique ex-vivo and in-vivo multimodal MRI-pathology database within the infrastructure of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (R01AG17917) and Religious Orders Study (ROS) (P30AG010161), two longitudinal, epidemiologic clinical- pathologic cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented individuals and have high follow-up rates and high autopsy rates. Using our database, we have produced compelling preliminary results in support of our aims. First, we have demonstrated that ex-vivo brain MRI data can be linked to in-vivo MRI data. Second, we show that TDP43 pathology is related to specific brain MRI characteristics independent of other age-related pathologies. Third, we show high TDP43 classification performance (AUC=0.81) based on ex-vivo MRI features in persons with as well as without comorbid Alzheimer’s pathology (a common coexisting pathology). Fourth, we demonstrate that the confidence score obtained from ex-vivo MRI classification is linked to the progression of deposition of TDP43 pathology (i.e. TDP43 stages). Finally, we translated a preliminary ex-vivo TDP43 classifier for use in-vivo and demonstrated in a small sample that it has high in-vivo classification performance, and is independently associated with lower cognition. We propose to further develop and test this promising in-vivo MRI classifier of TDP43 pathology in aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP43) pathology is now recognized as a common and deleterious age-related neuropathology, however, there is currently no approach that provides in-vivo accurate information about the presence of TDP43 pathology in aging, and diagnosis is only possible at autopsy. The objective of the proposed project is to develop and test an in-vivo MRI-based classifier of TDP43 pathology in older community- dwelling persons with and without dementia, based on a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of macro-structural, micro-structural and chemical characteristics of the brain. Successful completion of the proposed work will have broad immediate implications in refining participant selection in clinical trials, as well as long term implications in the advancement of translational research and targeted disease-specific therapeutic approaches.",In-vivo MRI-based prediction of TDP43 pathology in aging,10179293,R01AG064233,"['Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease pathology', 'Autopsy', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Epidemiology', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Sampling', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transact', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'follow-up', 'frontotemporal lobar dementia-amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'in vivo', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'non-demented', 'novel', 'pathology imaging', 'recruit', 'religious order study', 'response']",NIA,ILLINOIS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R01,2021,663226
"Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. The clinical gold standards to diagnose and guide treatment of patients with CAD are based on invasive catheter-based procedures, such as x-ray coronary angiography (XCA) for anatomic assessment or fractional flow reserve (FFR) for physiologic assessment. However, there are costs and risks associated with such invasive procedures. Such concerns are further highlighted by the fact that large studies have shown nearly two-thirds of patients referred for their initial elective invasive XCA were found to have no significant stenoses. Thus, better non-invasive diagnostic tools are needed. Cardiac MRI (CMR) is the only non-invasive imaging modality that provides a comprehensive assessment of CAD in a single examination, including an assessment of myocardial perfusion, cardiac function and viability, as well as angiographic evaluation of stenoses, without requiring ionizing radiation. These properties also allow for repeat testing as may be clinically indicated. However, despite its great potential to serve as the non- invasive gatekeeper for costly invasive procedures, lengthy examination times have prevented CMR from clinical translation. Although several accelerated imaging techniques have been proposed, these still require trade-offs between coverage, resolution and signal-to-noise ratio. In this proposal, we will develop and validate novel acquisition and reconstruction strategies to enable a highly accelerated high-resolution whole heart CMR exam for comprehensive CAD assessment in under 10 minutes. We will develop fast and low specific absorption rate outer volume suppression modules to reduce the source of aliasing artifacts from the chest and the back. This will enable higher rates for simultaneous multi-slice imaging in perfusion and cine CMR, improving coverage substantially with minimal noise amplification. For coronary MRI and viability imaging, simultaneous multi-slab imaging will be introduced to CMR, facilitating high isotropic resolution acquisitions with fast coverage. These acquisitions will be supplemented with regularized leakage-blocking and patient- specific machine learning reconstructions for further artifact and noise removal. Finally, we will implement and validate the proposed rapid comprehensive CMR exam in a cohort of suspected CAD patients, comparing our approach with conventional clinical CMR for the assessment of function, perfusion, and viability, and with invasive XCA for the assessment of coronary stenosis. Successful completion of this project has the potential to transform CMR into a leading rapid non-invasive tool for safe and accurate diagnosis of CAD, improving the healthcare of several million patients with chest pain and other CAD symptoms annually. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for one in six deaths. Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive non-ionizing technique for comprehensive evaluation of CAD, but its clinical translation is hampered by lengthy exam times. In this work, we will develop and validate techniques for rapid cardiac MRI in a short exam time for comprehensive CAD assessment.",Rapid Comprehensive Cardiac MRI Exam for Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease,10171902,R01HL153146,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Accounting', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Back', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Chest', 'Chest Pain', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Angiography', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Stenosis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Evaluation', 'Excision', 'Extravasation', 'Gadolinium', 'Gatekeeping', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical Care Costs', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological', 'Preparation', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Work', 'absorption', 'accurate diagnosis', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'cost', 'diagnosis standard', 'disease diagnosis', 'heart function', 'high resolution imaging', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'non-invasive imaging', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2021,487354
"Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. The inability of non-invasive techniques to quantify disease progression has limited understanding of the pathogenesis of OA. While numerous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been proposed for imaging OA, sensitivity to bone metabolism has been limited. We propose to develop advanced three-dimensional PET-MRI methods for bone and soft tissue metabolism to study the response of the tissues in the joint to changes in knee load. This work will lead to a new understanding of OA pathogenesis by revealing relationships between changes in cartilage and bone metabolism over time. This project aims to develop PET-MRI methods to sensitively track changes of OA in response to biomechanical loading. Our specific aims are to (1) Develop accurate, reproducible and dose-optimized kinetic models of dynamic 18F-NaF PET-MRI for quantitative bilateral whole joint imaging using deep learning and advanced MR coil technology, (2) Study the relationship between resting state bone metabolism and biomechanics using PET- MRI and (3) Perform a longitudinal study to assess the response of our new imaging methods to changes in joint biomechanics from gait retraining. The innovation of this work lies in the development of novel imaging techniques that simultaneously offer quantitative measures of tissue physiology in cartilage and bone using PET-MRI. The significance of this work is that we will be able to sensitively and quantitatively track changes in bone metabolism and soft tissue microstructure due to changes in biomechanical loading in the knee joint over time. This will provide new and more sensitive imaging tools to assess the responses of the joint to biomechanical interventions to treat OA such as gait retraining, bracing, or high tibial osteotomy. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for assessment of disease-modifying treatments such as bracing or gait modification. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using positron-emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health during mechanical treatment of osteoarthritis. !",Development of Sodium Fluoride PET-MRI for Quantitative Assessment of Knee Osteoarthritis,10202485,R01AR074492,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Arthralgia', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Matrix', 'Bone Spur', 'Bone Tissue', 'Bone remodeling', 'Canes', 'Cartilage', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Dose', 'Environment', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fluoride Ion', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Knee joint', 'Lateral', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Medial', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Morphology', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Needs Assessment', 'Orthopedics', 'Osteotomy', 'Pain', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Photons', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Productivity', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sclerosis', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'attenuation', 'base', 'bone', 'bone metabolism', 'cartilage metabolism', 'clinical translation', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'efficacy evaluation', 'flexibility', 'gait examination', 'gait rehabilitation', 'imaging approach', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'joint loading', 'kinetic model', 'mechanical force', 'mechanical properties', 'mineralization', 'molecular marker', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiotracer', 'response', 'soft tissue', 'subchondral bone', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'uptake']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,425647
"Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI PROJECT SUMMARY It was long taken for granted that obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is the primary driver of angina and major adverse cardiac events. However, recent landmark studies have shown that up to 50% of the patients referred for diagnostic testing have ischemia with no obstructive CAD (INOCA). A large proportion of INOCA patients have coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD), which even in the absence of flow-limiting stenoses can lead to myocardial ischemia and carries a high risk of adverse events. The reference standard for assessment of CMD is the functional coronary reactivity (CR) test, which is invasive. Despite key studies showing value of stratifying therapy based on CR testing, the practical utility of CR testing in the INOCA population is limited by its invasive nature, which carries serious risks even at experienced centers. Hence, a noninvasive approach that can detect and stage the severity of CMD would be invaluable for managing INOCA patients. Driven by this unmet need, prior studies have employed imaging approaches to index myocardial perfusion reserve (MPR) against CR; however, the association shown to date between MPR and CR impairment has been weak, likely due to the suboptimal sensitivity of MPR to subendocardial myocardial blood flow (MBF) deficits which is a hallmark of CMD. Studies using invasive microsphere-based methods have established a stress subendocardial-to-subepicardial (endo-epi) MBF gradient of larger than 1.0 in healthy animals, and shown that it decreases well below 1 under abnormally elevated microvascular resistance. However, noninvasive detection of endo-epi MBF gradients using existing imaging strategies is challenging because of the need to resolve MBF transmurally. We have developed new MRI strategies aimed at overcoming key barriers for accurate evaluation of endo-epi MBF gradients and applied them in preliminary animal and patient studies. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesize that in the setting of CMD, impaired microvascular CR manifests as a stress-induced endo- epi MBF gradient, and the magnitude of this gradient significantly correlates with CMD severity. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop a free-breathing artifact-free MRI technique optimized for high-resolution imaging of endo-epi MBF gradients, combined with a machine learning approach for fully-automated objective quantification of MBF gradients. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity can be staged on the basis of MRI-derived stress MBF gradient in a pig model of CMD. In Aim 3, we will test the hypothesis that CMD severity in INOCA patients is highly correlated with MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. This project brings together multiple interdisciplinary investigators with a strong collective track record in developing cardiac imaging strategies to advance a noninvasive approach for determining CMD severity based on the MRI-derived stress MBF gradient. Hence the proposal is a major step towards improving the management of INOCA patients and towards imaging-guided evaluation of novel therapies aimed at CMD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent landmark studies have provided evidence that “small vessel” coronary dysfunction in patients with otherwise normal coronary arteries is a major cause of heart disease and can lead to poor health outcomes including heart failure. This research proposal seeks to develop a noninvasive approach for diagnosis and monitoring of small-vessel coronary dysfunction by developing innovative and reliable magnetic resonance imaging strategies. Our proposal has the potential to improve patient care in this population by providing a noninvasive alternative to the established invasive testing procedure, which carries a risk of complications and is only available at highly specialized medical centers.",Noninvasive Testing of Coronary Microvascular Reactivity Using High-resolution Free-breathing MRI,10217254,R01HL153430,"['Animals', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Clinical', 'Coronary', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Coronary Vessels', 'Coronary artery', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Diet', 'Echocardiography', 'Endothelium', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Family suidae', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hypertrophy', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microcirculation', 'Microspheres', 'Microvascular Dysfunction', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Myocardial perfusion', 'Nature', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Quality of life', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Proposals', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Staging', 'Stress', 'Systole', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Vasodilator Agents', 'adverse event risk', 'base', 'experience', 'heart imaging', 'high resolution imaging', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging approach', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'perfusion imaging', 'personalized medicine', 'recruit', 'sequence learning']",NHLBI,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,760832
"Enabling Kinematic Joint Profiling Using MRI Project Summary We propose a technical feasibility study seeking to develop methods for quantitative kinematic proﬁling of moving joints using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In the context of this study, a kinematic proﬁle is deﬁned as a collection of joint characteristics computed and tracked during the course of movement. This project is motivated by the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions. At a high level, it is envisioned that the proposed kinematic proﬁles could ﬁt into clinical management workﬂows much in the same way as blood biomarker panels.  While kinematic imaging of joints can be performed using plain-ﬁlm (PF) X-ray, computed tomography (CT), and ultrasound (US) methods, MRI is the gold-standard for advanced orthopedic assessment and is an appealing option for accessory kinematic analysis. A set of relatively fast kinematic proﬁling acquisitions could feasibly be added to routine orthopedic MRI exams, thereby providing optimal diagnostic imaging in both static and kinematic contexts within a single visit.  Though several preliminary studies have hinted at the potential diagnostic value of kinematic imaging data, such data is difﬁcult to interpret and cannot easily be quantiﬁed or captured in clinical records. In this study, we seek to establish fundamental methods that can provide simple and easily digestible kinematic imaging reports with data acquired in a short scan interval using conventional clinical MRI equipment.  As a preliminary feasibility investigation of these methods, kinematic imaging of the wrist will be studied. Dysfunction of the scaphoid and lunate bones in the wrist is a well-studied kinematic problem of diagnostic signiﬁcance. Novel 4D zero-echo-time MRI of the wrist will be used to capture the kinematic imaging using for proﬁling of the scaphoid-lunate mechanics during two established wrist movement patterns.  The goal of this project is to establish and demonstrate methodological components required for MRI kinematic proﬁling. Data collection on a modest-sized cohort of 100 healthy control subjects is proposed for this purpose. Novel MRI pulse-sequence and post-processing development components are introduced and tasked for analysis of this normative data. Using the acquired MRI data, kinematic parameters for each dynamic dataset will be extracted and curated into a multi-parametric proﬁle for each subject.  Aim 2 of the study proposes the use of external sensor motion capture methods to validate the MRI-based kinematic parameter measurements on 50% of the study cohort.  Finally, Aim 3 of the study seeks to use machine-learning clustering approaches to develop a kinematic proﬁle normalization procedure using the acquired control dataset. Such normalization is a crucial milestone in the translation of kinematic proﬁling to the clinic and will establish a baseline for future translational studies of symptomatic cohorts. Project Narrative We seek to develop and demonstrate fundamental methods in quantitative kinematic proﬁling using clinical diagnostic imaging equipment. This technical development project is constructed under the hypothesis that such proﬁling of moving joints can highlight dysfunction, treatment progress, and point towards favorable (or unfavorable) surgical interventions.

"CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI Renewal CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Abstract Many studies have established strong relationships between cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), morphological and physiological brain changes, including stroke, and cognitive decline and dementia, including Alzheimer disease and related disorders (ADRD). New physiological and functional MRI (fMRI) methods allow non- invasive measurement of regional cerebral blood flow, vascular reactivity and physiological brain connectivity. These techniques provide the means to evaluate the morphology, pathophysiology, and brain dysfunction related to CEVD and ADRD. The CARDIA Year 25 and Year 30 Brain MRI Substudies were designed to incorporate state-of-the-art MRI technology into the relatively younger population of CARDIA in order to determine MRI correlates of CVD risk factors and detect early CEVD. These studies documented early MRI changes of CEVD with strong correlations to CVD risk factors, particularly hypertension. The CARDIA Year 35 MRI Ancillary Study is intended to extend these earlier studies into the late middle age population of CARDIA. Most biomarkers of CEVD and ADRD are weakly expressed until approximately age 55, when they begin their precipitous rise to the steep slope evident in the 6th and 7th decades of life. Correspondingly, subclinical disease becomes clinically evident, reflected by increasing physiological changes and cognitive deficits. However, confounding the effects of CEVD are age, lifestyle, and co-morbidities, including ADRD. CARDIA, with its lengthy and rich historical data, is well-positioned to dissect the intricacies of CEVD and putative relationship to ADRD in the transition from middle age to seniority, starting at ages with few comorbidities and low medication use. Approximately 1044 participants will be enrolled in the Ancillary Study from the four participating Field Centers. MRI participants will be recruited from previous CARDIA Brain MRI participants and receive brain MRI scans and cognitive testing as defined for Y25 and Y30. Computer analysis of MRI data will be reported quantitatively by anatomic regions-of-interest. The primary objectives are to: 1) enhance statistical power to better document previously described and newly defined associations between demographic measures, risk factors and brain MRI findings, 2) define MRI parameters most strongly associated with clinical events and cognitive changes, and 3) identify early MRI biomarker patterns that inform disease pathophysiology and progression at an individual level. CARDIA Y35 Brain MRI Renewal Ancillary Study Project Narrative The CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI ancillary proposal will study the long-term associations between cerebrovascular disease, cardiovascular disease risk factors, brain MRI findings, clinical events, and cognitive changes in young and mid adulthood as reflected in the CARDIA population. Early-onset and mid-life clinical events and cognitive changes in conjunction with a third brain MRI study and cognitive testing will allow us to define MRI pattern subtypes better reflecting pathophysiological variants reflective of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases. The primary objectives are to: 1) enhance statistical power to better document previously described and newly defined associations between demographic measures, risk factors and brain MRI findings. 2) define MRI parameters most strongly associated with clinical events and cognitive changes reflective of cerebrovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and 3) identify new, early MRI biomarker patterns that inform disease pathophysiology and progression at an individual level.",CARDIA Year 35 Brain MRI Renewal,10171752,R01AG062819,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Ancillary Study', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Analysis', 'Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Enrollment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hypertension', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Life', 'Life Style', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Nature', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Race', 'Reporting', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Variant', 'Woman', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'aging population', 'blood pressure regulation', 'brain dysfunction', 'brain volume', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive testing', 'comorbidity', 'design', 'early onset', 'epidemiologic data', 'follow-up', 'high dimensionality', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'men', 'middle age', 'neuroimaging', 'predictive modeling', 'recruit', 'sex', 'study population', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,995375
"Rapid motion-robust quantitative DCE-MRI for the assessment of gynecologic cancers PROJECT SUMMARY  Gynecologic cancers are some of the most lethal diseases affecting women. Globally, one woman dies of cervical cancer every two minutes. MRI is increasingly used in the evaluation of gynecologic and many other cancers. Beyond its established use for cancer staging, there has long been an interest in the use of MRI-derived quantitative metrics to gain insights into the tumor microenvironment. Parametric maps obtained from quantification of dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI data can be used to study tumor vascularity and identify tumors that are better perfused and oxygenated and thus more sensitive to some treatments such as chemotherapy and radiation. However, the relative slow imaging speed and motion sensitivity of current MRI technology results in non-reliable and non-reproducible quantification of DCE-MRI data, which restricts its application in clinical practice.  Our group is a world leader in development of rapid motion-resistant DCE-MRI techniques, in particular using combinations of radial imaging and compressed sensing. We developed the technique called GRASP, which was conceived as an academic-industrial partnership and has now been successfully translated into standard clinical practice. Though powerful, the first generation of GRASP has limitations. First, radial imaging is robust to motion, but not free of motion, which usually results in blurring. Second, GRASP uses a very simple sparsifying transform for compressed sensing, which can introduce issues with quantification. Third, GRASP was not originally developed for pharmacokinetic analysis and misses important ingredients such as integration of AIF estimation and T1 mapping. Fourth, image reconstruction time is still very long – in the order of several minutes.  We have developed new advances to circumvent these limitations and offer a new DCE-MRI technique with increased speed, motion-resistance and personalized AIF estimation and T1 mapping for pharmacokinetic analysis. Following the PAR-18-009 guidelines, our main goal is to form an academic-industrial partnership between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and General Electric Healthcare to translate these new developments in quantitative DCE-MRI for use in patients with gynecologic and other type of cancers. Specific Aims are as follows: 1. Develop and implement a fast motion-resistant quantitative DCE-MRI technique that goes beyond GRASP  to offer increased speed and resistance to motion; dynamic T1 mapping; and personalized and automated  pharmacokinetic analysis 2. Evaluate the repeatability, reproducibility and preliminary tumor response assessment of the fast motion-  robust quantitative DCE-MRI technique (“DCE-new”) and compare DCE-new to standard of care DCE-MRI  (“DCE-standard”) in patients with gynecologic cancer 3. Develop and evaluate fast image reconstruction algorithms based on deep learning PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to establish an academic-industrial partnership between Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and General Electric Healthcare to develop and disseminate advances in dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI for use in cancer patients. The new developments, which include radial imaging, compressed sensing, and deep learning, will deliver rapid motion-resistant DCE-MRI with high spatial and temporal resolution for more accurate and reproducible quantification of MRI-derived metrics. The new technology to be disseminated as a prototype on GE scanners will promote the use of quantitative DCE-MRI biomarkers in clinical practice, a long-desired goal.",Rapid motion-robust quantitative DCE-MRI for the assessment of gynecologic cancers,10267713,R01CA244532,"['Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Automation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Chemotherapy and/or radiation', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Neoplasm Staging', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Early treatment', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Gynecologic', 'Gynecology', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'International', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Female Reproductive System Neoplasm', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Maps', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'New York', 'Patients', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Radial', 'Relapse', 'Reproducibility', 'Resistance', 'Speed', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Tumor stage', 'Universities', 'Woman', 'advanced disease', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer type', 'chemoradiation', 'clinical practice', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'experience', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'individualized medicine', 'industry partner', 'insight', 'interest', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'motion sensitivity', 'new technology', 'novel', 'population based', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'standard of care', 'success', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R01,2021,568123
"Rapid Motion-Robust and Easy-to-Use Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Liver Perfusion Quantification Project Summary The broad objective of this application is to develop a rapid motion-robust and easy-to-use dynamic contrast- enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) framework for liver perfusion quantification and to evaluate its performance in quantitative assessment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most prevalent primary malignancy in the liver. Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) using gadolinium-based contrast agents is currently a cornerstone for identifying and characterizing hepatic lesions, including HCC. However, the current clinical use of liver DCE-MRI is limited to visual assessment of the pattern of perfusion in 3-4 multiphasic images (arterial, venous and delayed phases), and these images are routinely acquired during multiple breath holds. DCE-MRI also has the potential for quantitative assessment of perfusion kinetics, which can provide a deeper insight into the tumor microenvironment for non-invasive characterization of different histological features of the tumor, such as tumor angiogenesis and aggressiveness. This is particularly relevant for HCC, which is typically diagnosed based on imaging without pathological confirmation from invasive biopsy. Unfortunately, conventional liver perfusion MRI techniques suffer from a number of important limitations that restrict its clinical implementation, including (1) slow imaging speed, (2) limited spatiotemporal resolution, (3) sensitivity to motion artifacts, and (4) time-consuming quantitative perfusion analysis. Meanwhile, the need for pre-contrast T1 mapping to convert MR signal to gadolinium concentration further complicates the already-cumbersome imaging workflow. These challenges and underlying complexity have all led to non-reproducible performance of liver perfusion MRI and have significantly diminished its ultimate clinical utility. In this project, we propose to develop new rapid MRI techniques combining novel motion-robust sampling strategies and advanced reconstruction models to address these challenges. The new imaging techniques will enable motion-robust 3D T1 mapping with whole-liver coverage for efficient estimation of contrast concentration and free-breathing DCE-MRI of the liver with high spatiotemporal resolution. We will also incorporate state-of-the-art methods in deep learning to further improve imaging performance, to reduce reconstruction time, and to substantially simplify perfusion quantification. These new technical developments will be integrated into a new liver perfusion MRI framework, which will be translated into the clinical setting for assessment of HCC in an exploratory clinical study. The overall hypothesis is that with the new imaging framework developed in the project, robust high spatiotemporal resolution perfusion MRI of the liver can be achieved under free breathing, and absolute quantification of liver perfusion can be performed without user- interaction. Given the rapidly rising incidence and substantial burden of HCC in the United States, successful completion of this project would enable significant progress towards improved characterization and management of HCC and other liver diseases with high clinical impact. Project Narrative The objective of this application is to develop and evaluate a rapid motion-robust and easy-to-use dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) framework for liver perfusion quantification. This new imaging framework is expected to promote the utilization, efficacy and clinical translation of liver perfusion MRI for improved management of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other diseases of high clinical impact.",Rapid Motion-Robust and Easy-to-Use Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI for Liver Perfusion Quantification,10297597,R01EB030549,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Aftercare', 'Biopsy', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Gadolinium', 'Hepatic', 'Histologic', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Liver', 'Liver Dysfunction', 'Liver diseases', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Phase', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Primary carcinoma of the liver cells', 'Radial', 'Recovery', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Systemic Therapy', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Tumor Angiogenesis', 'Tumor Burden', 'United States', 'Venous', 'Visual', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'cancer type', 'care costs', 'clinical implementation', 'clinical translation', 'contrast enhanced', 'curative treatments', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'feasibility testing', 'flexibility', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'ineffective therapies', 'insight', 'interest', 'liver imaging', 'mortality', 'motion sensitivity', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prevent', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'routine imaging', 'side effect', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NIBIB,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,464700
"Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect, affecting 1.2% of all live births. Imaging plays a major role in managing CHD but remains challenging for evaluating complex cardiac and vascular abnormalities across a wide range of age and habitus. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed cardiovascular 4D flow MRI which can measure complex 3D blood flow in-vivo, a task difficult or impossible to obtain with other imaging strategies. Recent efforts have focused on two forms of CHD: 1) bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) which is the most common form of CHD, and 2) single ventricle physiology (SVP), one of the most severe forms of CHD. Our 4D flow MRI studies have successfully identified new hemodynamic biomarkers to better characterize CHD. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between aberrant 3D blood flow, elevated wall shear stress (WSS), aortopathy phenotype, and aortic wall tissue degeneration on histopathology in patients with BAV. In patients with SVP, our findings demonstrated relationships between surgical correction strategies and flow distribution to the lungs, a known factor implicated in SVP outcome. We have achieved successful clinical translation at Northwestern, where 4D flow MRI is now used as a clinical tool in diagnostic MRI exams for patients with CHD and aortic disease. Over the past four years, the PIs have assembled one of the largest 4D MRI databases with over 2500 patient exams. For this renewal application, we identified a need to increase the dynamic range of 4D MRI flow sensitivity to account for data complexity (3D + time) and the wide age range in CHD by a combination of dual-venc flow encoding, compressed sensing, and SSFP imaging. Second, three is a need for longitudinal studies to identify predictors of BAV and SVP outcome. Third, making these unique but complex 4D MRI data sets and analysis tools more widely available to the greater research community is challenging. In addition, no automated methods currently exist for advanced processing such as atlas based analysis across large cohorts. Analysis is thus time consuming and requires manual interactions (e.g. 3D vessel segmentation) which limits reproducibility and translation. To address this need, an established Northwestern data archival and pipeline processing resource based on remote high-performance computing clusters (NUNDA) will be utilized for standardized data archival, sharing, and pipeline processing of 4D MRI data. This platform will provide the unique opportunity to utilize annotated data available in the 4D MRI database (>1300 BAV, SVP, and control 4D MRI data analyzed in the initial funding cycle) for application of machine learning concepts to establish (semi-)automated 4D MRI analysis workflows in NUNDA. Thus, the renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop a rapid (15 min) non-contrast 4D MRI for clinical translation, 2) leverage the existing large 4D MRI database to identify 4D MRI metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) CHD patient outcome, and 3) establish a remote NUNDA platform for 4D MRI data sharing and automated analysis across large cohorts. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop non-contrast 4D MRI, a new diagnostic test to achieve an improved assessment for the most common and one of the most severe forms of congenital heart disease: bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. We will leverage an existing large 4D MRI database to allow for long-term 5-8-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management for patients with bicuspid aortic valve and single ventricle physiology. A comprehensive data archive will be established to allow for the dissemination of the 4D MRI data, analysis tools, and study results to the greater research community.",Functional Cardiovascular 4D MRI in Congenital Heart Disease,10117035,R01HL115828,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Aortic Diseases', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood flow', 'Cardiac Output', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Common Ventricle', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'High Performance Computing', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Link', 'Live Birth', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Oxygen', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Population', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Secure', 'Sex Differences', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translations', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'aortic valve', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bicuspid aortic valve', 'clinical translation', 'cluster computing', 'cohort', 'congenital heart disorder', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data sharing', 'data standards', 'design', 'exercise capacity', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'outcome prediction', 'patient population', 'pediatric patients', 'prevent', 'shear stress', 'spatiotemporal', 'tissue degeneration', 'tool', 'vascular abnormality']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,709759
"Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification Project Abstract Motivation: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 500 million people. Children commonly develop CKD from urinary obstructive diseases and nephrotoxic therapies, and then suffer severe growth failure,  hypertension, cardiovascular risks, and neurocognitive deficits, and eventually end-stage kidney disease. Accurate renal function quantification will improve clinical management of hydronephrosis (1 in 100 babies) and  dosing/selection of chemotherapeutic regimens in oncology patients. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), the biomarker of renal function, is derived from blood or urine tests. These tests only provide global GFR and are limited in accuracy, especially in children, and even more so in children with cancer. MRI offers superb anatomic delineation without ionizing radiation, and is thus ideal for pediatric kidney imaging. However, MRI has not been widely adopted for pediatric renal function evaluation due to lack of reliability and cumbersome workflow. These hurdles stem from the fact that the critical components required for global and regional GFR calculation, including high spatiotemporal resolution, plasma flow and arterial input function, are difficult to obtain, and that accurate image segmentation of kidneys (cortex and medulla) is labor intensive. Additionally, although the same contrast agent injection can be used for obstruction evaluation, certain areas of the kidney suffer from significant signal loss using standard MRI acquisition techniques due to high contrast agent concentrations. This project addresses these major challenges for automated comprehensive renal function evaluation in children. Approach: The project has three development aims, which are validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable novel free-breathing time-resolved 3D dynamic contrast enhanced MRI that simultaneously provides accurate GFR calculation and renal plasma flow. This is achieved by incorporating self-navigated motion compensation, fast acquisition with parallel imaging and compressed sensing, and phase-contrast flow imaging. The second aim is to develop multiple new image analysis methods to extract GFR and renal plasma flow (RPF) that  leverage novel flow data of Aim 1, as well as automated new machine-learning image processing techniques for the segmentation of kidneys and ultimately global and regional GFR calculation. In Aim 3, we will develop and integrate ultrashort-echo-time techniques to address the MRI signal loss due to T2* effects from high contrast concentration for patients with obstruction, and further incorporate motion compensation and accelerated  imaging methods to enable time-resolved high-resolution dynamic MRI for contrast washout kinetics analysis in the same MR exam. Aim 4 will determine the performance of these methods in a clinical setting. Significance: This work will lead to robust, automated comprehensive pediatric renal MRI for safer and more accurate renal function evaluation in children. The techniques will facilitate widespread application in the com- munity setting and permit robust evaluation of renal function, for both children and adults. Project Narrative Kidney diseases in children often stem from blockages of the urinary tract or toxicity from medications, such as antibiotics or chemotherapies. Kidney function quantification is crucial for clinical management of these children. This work will develop accurate and automated pediatric MRI for quantification of kidney function and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction.",Development and Validation of Radiation-Free Pediatric Renal Function Quantification,10105323,R01EB026136,"['3-Dimensional', '4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Adopted', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Antibiotics', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac Output', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Cone', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'End stage renal failure', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Failure', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Gold', 'Growth', 'Hydronephrosis', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Kinetics', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant Childhood Neoplasm', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Obstruction', 'Oncology', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Plasma', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Reflux', 'Regimen', 'Renal Blood Flow', 'Renal Plasma Flow', 'Renal function', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxic effect', 'Urinary tract', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Venous', 'Work', 'antimicrobial drug', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'chemotherapeutic agent', 'chemotherapy', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'experience', 'image processing', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'kidney cortex', 'kidney imaging', 'loss of function', 'nephrotoxicity', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pressure', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem', 'urinary', 'urinary tract obstruction', 'urologic']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,645115
"FreeSurfer Development, Maintenance, and Hardening Abstract: Imaging of the human brain has seen explosive growth in the last two decades mainly through the various modalities of MRI. The massive amount of data requires automatic and robust tools for analysis. FreeSurfer (FS, surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu) is one of the preeminent tools used for neuroimage analysis. FS has more than 44,000 downloads, and the core FS manuscripts have been cited more than 22,000 times. FS is part of the analysis core for many NIH-funded large-scale data acquisition projects such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP), Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), Framingham Heart Study (FHS), The Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD), as well as the UK BioBank. One third of the 600+ ADNI-based publications cite FS. Simply put, much of the innovative research done in neuroimaging would not be possible without FS. Started in 1998, FS is best known for providing detailed and automated anatomical analysis of T1-weighted MRI images, especially for the cortical surface. However, FS anatomical analysis provides an ideal substrate for all modes of brain imaging including functional MRI, diffusion MRI, PET, optical/NIRS, as well as EEG/MEG. FS provides tools to perform these analyses as well as software to integrate with other analysis tools (e.g., SPM, FSL, AFNI). FS has been used for presurgical planning and even in the operating room.  The original grant mostly centered around Sequence Adaptive Multimodal Segmentation (SAMSEG). SAMSEG uses parametric Bayesian generative modeling to segment brain images. The SAMSEG framework fits atlas priors and multivariate Gaussian intensity models to brain images (including MRI artifacts such as bias fields). SAMSEG can take any modality or combination of modalities as input. Since it adapts its intensity model, it is robust to differences in scanner. Since it is a generative model, it is easy to extend to encompass more segmentation details. For example, the SAMSEG framework has been used to segment hippocampal subfield, amygdalar nuclei, thalamic nuclei, and extracerebral structures.  The main vision for the renewal is to extend the SAMSEG framework to accommodate longitudinal models, incorporate more anatomical details, and to use SAMSEG output as a basis for cortical surface placement that is, like SAMSEG, modality independent and capable of using any combination of modalities. In addition, we propose a series of new tools that will assist in the individual and group analysis of large studies by creating study-specific models. In addition to this new technical development, we are requesting support for software engineering, maintenance, and user support – mundane and not innovative, but high-impact this type of support is critical to the thousands of researchers who rely on FreeSurfer. Narrative: This work will support the popular FreeSurfer neuroimaging analysis software program used by thousands of researchers world-wide. FreeSurfer uses cutting edge algorithms to automatically extract a host of biomarkers from brain imaging data which can be used for research, pharmaceutical evaluation, and diagnosis. This proposal will allow for continued support of FreeSurfer from the developers as well as new development to make FreeSurfer faster, more robust, and easier to interpret.","FreeSurfer Development, Maintenance, and Hardening",10130964,R01EB023281,"['Adolescent', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Framingham Heart Study', 'Free Will', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Industrialization', 'Inherited', 'Lesion', 'Leukoaraiosis', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Manuscripts', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'Neurosciences', 'Operating Rooms', 'Optics', 'Output', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Probability', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Series', 'Software Engineering', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Testing', 'Thalamic Nuclei', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vision', 'Work', 'base', 'biobank', 'bone', 'cognitive development', 'connectome', 'cranium', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'human imaging', 'innovation', 'large scale data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'programs', 'success', 'synergism', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIBIB,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,555356
"Next-generation in-vivo fetal neuroimaging Next-Generation In-Vivo Fetal Neuroimaging The overall objective of this project is to dramatically improve fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to advance research in early human brain development and neurodevelopmental disorders, the burden of which is, unfortunately, high because of their life-long impact and high prevalence. Fetal MRI has been the technique of choice in studying prenatal brain development. Fetal motion, however, makes MRI slice acquisition unreliable at best, as the fetus frequently moves while the prescribed slices are imaged. Uncompensated fetal motion disrupts 3D coverage of the anatomy and reduces the spatial resolution of slice-to-volume reconstructions. Repeating the scans does not ensure full 3D coverage of the anatomy, but increases total acquisition time. This, in turn, dramatically reduces the success rate and reliability of fetal MRI in studying the development of transient fetal brain compartments that are selectively sensitive to injury over the course of fetal development. To mitigate these issues and improve fetal MRI, we propose to automatically measure fetal brain position and prospectively navigate slices to each new position in real-time. The impact of this approach will be to dramatically increase the success rate and spatial resolution of fetal MRI for the in-vivo investigation of developing brain compartments, while, in parallel, reducing scan time, effectively making fetal MRI less burdensome for the mother, more accurate, and cost effective. By eliminating the manual re- adjustment of stack-of-slice positions, the time that elapses between scans will be virtually continuous. Our proposed technique will also make fetal MRI less operator-dependent and thus, more reproducible across sites, which is essential to conducting multi-center studies and clinical trials. Prospective navigation of fetal MRI slices to compensate for motion requires the development of novel, real-time image processing algorithms to recognize the fetal brain and its position and orientation; to track fetal motion to steer slices; and to detect and re-acquire motion corrupted slices. In this project, we will develop innovative deep learning models to process fetal MRI slices in real-time; will translate those models into an integrated system to prospectively navigate fetal MRI slices; and will validate the system on fetuses scanned at various gestational ages. To assess the utility and impact of the proposed technology, we will measure subplate volume in fetuses. The four specific aims of this study are to 1) assess fetal MRI via variable density image acquisition and reconstruction; 2) achieve real-time recognition of the fetal brain in MRI slices; 3) develop a system of real-time fetal head motion tracking and steering of slices; and 4) measure the subplate volume in the developing fetal brain using MRI. These aims will collectively translate and validate new imaging and image processing techniques to advance fetal MRI, and effectively eliminate a critical barrier to making progress in the fields of developmental neurology and neuroscience. Project Narrative: The proposed research aims to develop, translate, and validate innovative in-vivo imaging technologies to improve imaging and studying the development of the human fetal brain before birth. The technology will enable and improve studies on the development of the brain in fetuses with congenital disorders or fetuses at risk of having neurodevelopmental issues later in life. This in-turn is expected to result in timely and more effective treatments and therapeutic interventions that will lead to vastly improved patient outcomes in both the short- and long-term, effectively reducing the burden of human disabilities arising from congenital disorders.",Next-generation in-vivo fetal neuroimaging,10280126,R01EB031849,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Classification', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Congenital Disorders', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Gestational Age', 'Head', 'Health Care Costs', 'High Prevalence', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Life', 'Live Birth', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Mothers', 'Motion', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurology', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Real-Time Systems', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Rotation', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Uterus', 'absorption', 'brain tissue', 'cognitive disability', 'congenital heart disorder', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'fetal', 'fetus at risk', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'innovation', 'large datasets', 'migration', 'myelination', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'prenatal', 'prospective', 'real-time images', 'reconstruction', 'recurrent neural network', 'success', 'virtual']",NIBIB,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,588593
"Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Heart transplant (HTx) is a well-established life-saving procedure but is associated with severe complications. Current clinical monitoring algorithms rely on frequent invasive procedures including endomyocardial biopsies and catheter angiography. To address these limitations, the PIs have developed non-invasive comprehensive cardiac MRI, which can quantify regional changes in myocardial tissue and function. Our efforts have focused on the 2 major complications of HTx: 1) acute cardiac rejection (ACR), the leading cause of death in the first year after transplant; and 2) cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), the greatest risk factor for 5-year mortality beyond the first post-Tx year. Our cardiac MRI studies have identified new imaging biomarkers in HTx. We were the first to establish a physiologic link between abnormal cardiac MRI measures and potential allograft failure: myocardial T2 and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) as non-invasive tissue biomarkers for ACR. We demonstrated that the natural history of myocardial scarring, T2, and ECV predicts adverse clinical events in HTx recipients. In addition, our studies showed that donor and recipient mismatch (age, sex, weight, etc.) was significantly associated with cardiac MRI-derived measures of myocardial edema/inflammation, fibrosis, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. Over the past five years, the PIs have assembled a unique study database with over >450 comprehensive cardiac MRI exams comprising >110,000 annotated cardiac MRI images. For this renewal application, we identified the need to conduct further long-term follow-up studies tailored to the slow disease progression in HTx to identify changes over time in multiparametric MRI measures and predictors of HTx outcome. Second, data on graft tissue and function in the pediatric HTx population are scarce and improved strategies for donor-recipient matching in this vulnerable population are needed to make most efficient use of the limited availability of donor hearts in children. Thus, cardiac MRI needs to better account for age and sex related differences in patient habitus and physiology, critical for the wide age range in HTx from pediatric to adult. The renewal application for this study aims to 1) develop multiparametric cardiac MRI for the assessment of graft tissue (T2, T1, ECV), and dysfunction (myocardial velocities, strain) from pediatric to adult, 2) leverage the existing large cardiac MRI database (110,000 labeled cardiac MRI images) to establish deep learning based analysis pipelines for automated cardiac MRI analysis with improved efficiency and reduced inter-rater variability, 3) to identify predictors of adverse outcomes and to evaluate the impact of donor-recipient mismatch on graft tissue, function, and flow in a prospective study with pediatric HTx patients, and 4) to identify cardiac metrics predictive of long-term (> 5 years) HTx patient outcome by leveraging our HTx database (>145 HTx recipients with existing baseline cardiac MRI acquired during the initial funding cycle). Follow-up cardiac MRI will provide unique insights in changes over time in graft tissue and function as mechanism underlying different HTx patient trajectories (non-progression vs. late onset vs. slow progression vs. fast progression). PROJECT NARRATIVE Our goal is to develop multiparametric cardiac MRI and automated deep learning based cardiac MRI analysis workflows for improved assessment for complications after heart transplantation, the treatment of choice for many patients with end-stage heart failure. Cardiac MRI will be developed to allow for efficient application from pediatric to adult patients in order to evaluate its diagnostic value for non-invasively detecting complications and to investigate the impact of differences in heart donor and recipient characteristics on the performance of the transplanted heart. In addition, we will leverage an existing large cardiac MRI database to allow for long-term 5-year follow-up to establish new measures for improved outcome prediction and therapy management in heart transplant recipients.",Comprehensive Cardiac Structure-Function Analysis in Heart Transplantation,10208494,R01HL117888,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Allografting', 'Angiography', 'Biopsy', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiac', 'Catheters', 'Cause of Death', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cicatrix', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Disease Progression', 'Donor Selection', 'Donor person', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Event', 'Failure', 'Fibrosis', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Heart Abnormalities', 'Heart Rate', 'Heart Transplantation', 'Heart failure', 'Height', 'Hospitalization', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Inflammation', 'Label', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Longterm Follow-up', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial tissue', 'Natural History', 'Nature', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Study', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Right Ventricular Dysfunction', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling Errors', 'Savings', 'Severities', 'Sex Differences', 'Smoking', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Grafts', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplant Recipients', 'Transplantation', 'Transplantation Surgery', 'Transplanted Heart Complication', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Ventricular', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Weight', 'adverse outcome', 'analysis pipeline', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'cohort', 'cost estimate', 'deep learning', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'follow-up', 'graft failure', 'health care service utilization', 'heart allograft', 'heart dimension/size', 'heart function', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'insight', 'interstitial', 'mortality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric patients', 'sex', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard of care', 'tissue biomarkers', 'transplant database', 'treatment choice']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2021,695340
"Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee Project Abstract Motivation: Osteoarthritis (OA) is a painful disease that affects tens of millions of Americans, but is poorly understood, resulting in a lack of treatments. Enabling low-cost approaches for widespread study of risk factors, onset and early progression of OA will enable better understanding of OA mechanisms, treatment development, and triage of patients to different treatments based on speciﬁc disease phenotypes. Multiple systemic factors, biochemical factors, and other risk factors are associated with OA, but causes are difﬁ- cult to isolate and study during slow progression. Currently OA is diagnosed as joint-space narrowing using X-ray radiography, at a stage well beyond when interventions can be effective. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of- fers sensitivity to morphologic and biochemical changes, but most methods are impractical for widespread clinical or research use. Usually MRI exams study only one knee, precluding the opportunity to compare knees. Sim- ilarly, biomechanics assessment typically requires numerous tests using advanced and rarely-available equip- ment and time-intensive analysis by skilled personnel, making this a challenge for widespread use. We have shown rapid, simultaneous 3D scanning of both knees with quantitative relaxometry and diffusion map- ping of connective tissues, combined with novel visualization of longitudinal change validated in a population with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tears. We have developed fully-automated cartilage and meniscus seg- mentation to simplify post-processing. (Our automated cartilage segmentation variability approaches that of reader-to-reader variability.) We now propose to combine MRI acquisition, reconstruction and analysis tech- niques with simple measures of kinematics into a widely applicable low-cost imaging and biomechanical test, which we will validate in subjects with ACL-injury and subjects with varying Kellgren-Lawrence grades of OA. Approach: We will begin by developing a robust 5-to-8-minute bilateral knee MRI exam, using an efﬁcient 3D isotropic acquisition and novel deep-learning based image reconstructions. This will be followed with automated cartilage segmentation and quantitative analysis (thickness, T2, diffusion) of all 3 knee plates and automated semiquantitative scoring approaches for synovitis, bone marrow and cartilage lesions. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) will be used to measure kinematics, and gait asymmetries. We will continue our studies in ACL pa- tients to validate techniques and to develop asymmetry analyses for both imaging and biomechanical measures. Finally, in subjects with varying OA grade, we will evaluate the potential of the overall low-cost approach to relate asymmetry and longitudinal change measures to progression and OA grade. Signiﬁcance: This project will develop an acquisition and analysis pipeline to quantify knee changes and left/right asymmetries that precede OA. We will characterize methods in idiopathic OA subjects and ACL- injured subjects at risk of post-traumatic OA. The very low target cost, under $120/subject, will ultimately enable widespread study of early onset and progression of different OA types, leading to earlier and better treatments. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis remains the leading cause of disability, and effective treatment will require efﬁcient assessment of disease risk-factors, onset, and progression, both for development and personalization of minimally invasive interventions. We propose a 5-minute 3D MRI exam of both knees without radiation or contrast injection, that will be combined with low-cost measures of knee motion and fully automated analysis methods to provide quan- titative measurements of cartilage, tendon, ligament, bone and ﬁbrocartilage health and asymmetries between knees. This low-cost, rapid, bilateral assessment will enable research studies in large populations, as well as adding quantitative bilateral information to clinical scans to dramatically improve understanding of onset of dif- ferent types of osteoarthritis.",Rapid Low-Cost Quantitative 3D MRI and Gait Assessment of the Knee,10232306,R01AR077604,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anterior Cruciate Ligament', 'Articulation', 'Bilateral', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Bone Marrow', 'Bone Spur', 'Cartilage', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Connective Tissue', 'Cost Measures', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Fibrocartilages', 'Future', 'Gait', 'Gait abnormality', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Resources', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammatory', 'Injections', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Kellgren-Lawrence grade', 'Knee', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Left', 'Length', 'Lesion', 'Ligaments', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Output', 'Pain', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Radiation', 'Reader', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Slice', 'Surface', 'Synovitis', 'Techniques', 'Tendon structure', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'anterior cruciate ligament injury', 'anterior cruciate ligament rupture', 'automated analysis', 'base', 'bone', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'disability', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'early onset', 'effective therapy', 'gait examination', 'high body mass index', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'kinematics', 'learning classifier', 'meniscus injury', 'minimally invasive', 'novel', 'predictive test', 'primary outcome', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'research study', 'sensor', 'societal costs', 'therapy development', 'tissue biomarkers']",NIAMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,651069
"Multiband ASL for Neurodevelopment Study Project Summary/Abstract The developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood is marked by a mix of potential and vulnerability. A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during this critical period, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and the first signs of emotional disorders. It is important to understand detailed patterns of typical development, so alterations can be identified and rectified as early as possible. As an entirely noninvasive and quantitative imaging method, arterial spin labeled (ASL) perfusion MRI is increasingly being recognized as an important biomarker for functional brain development in both healthy populations and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, there remain significant challenges for making ASL an impactful tool in studying neurodevelopment, including: 1) a coarse spatial resolution of ~4x4x4mm3, 2) susceptibility to head motion with segmented 3D acquisitions, and 3) potential confounding effects of age dependent variations in arterial transit time using a single post-labeling delay (PLD) scan. Simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) or multiband (MB) is a new accelerated imaging technology that simultaneously excites multiple slices and recovers each slice with parallel imaging techniques. Preliminary studies combining MB with ASL showed that MB can reduce T1 relaxation of the label, improve spatial coverage and/or resolution compared to those of standard 2D ASL. MB imaging may also overcome the limitation of 3D ASL acquisitions in terms of head motion and spatial blurring. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of existing MB ASL is inferior to that of 3D ASL. This project builds on two recent innovations from our lab: 1) a constrained slice-dependent (CSD) background suppression (BS) technique that improves the SNR of 2D MB pCASL to be comparable to that of 3D pCASL; and 2) a single-shot 3D GRASE pCASL method with 2D CAIPIRINHA accelerations that improves the imaging speed of 3D pCASL. The goal of this R01 project is to develop and evaluate cutting-edge MB pCASL protocols that are able to offer a high spatial resolution of isotropic 2mm or higher, resistance to head motion and multi-delay capability for accurate perfusion quantification in pediatric populations. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based denoising algorithm for multi-delay MB pCASL will be further developed. The developed suite of MB pCASL protocol and post- processing algorithms will be evaluated in 40 typically developing children and adolescents. The successful completion of this R01 project will lead to a robust multi-delay MB pCASL protocol that is highly valuable as potential biomarker for both neurodevelopment research and pediatric clinical care. To maximize the scientific and clinical impact, we will continue disseminating the pulse sequence and associated post-processing software as we have been doing in the past decade. Relevance to Public Health A number of potentially life-long behavioral and emotional problems emerge during the developmental period between childhood to adolescence and young adulthood, including alcohol and illicit drug use, risky behaviors, and emotional disorders. This project will develop a robust noninvasive imaging technique using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that offers high spatial resolution, resistance to head motion and accurate quantification of cerebral blood flow in children and adolescents.

"Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI Project Summary / Abstract  Heart failure (HF) is accounts for 1 in 9 deaths in the United States and currently affects ~6 million with a prevalence of 250,00-400,000 and incidence of 70,000-120,000. Current therapy does not address the underlying loss of functional heart muscle and adverse structural remodeling. One novel potential treatment of HF is exercise (aerobic) therapy that has demonstrated various cardioprotective properties to halt and potentially reverse adverse structural remodeling. However, dosing of exercise therapy remains a challenge due to each individual's inherent differences and consequentially, serial non-invasive monitoring of the therapy would be necessary to evaluate the change on structural remodeling. Furthermore, current non-invasive technologies characterize structural remodeling with surrogate measures and thus, there is no consensus on a single clinical gold-standard. Without a tool to monitor and characterize the degree of structural remodeling, the evaluation of the therapeutic potential of exercise therapy in HF patients cannot be fully realized representing an unmet need in ultimately improving therapy. The proposed project aims to improve the therapy monitoring of exercise training to cardioprotect against HF by revealing its effect on microstructural remodeling with cardiac diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI). DT-MRI is a unique, non-invasive technology capable of characterizing myocardial fiber orientation and directly reflecting microstructural remodeling. However, despite major advances, there are fundamental challenges that limit the capability of current cardiac DT-MRI methods to be applied robustly in a clinical setting. In this project, an innovative 5-min “push button” DT-MRI method will be developed that overcomes such limitations. We also leverage institutional strengths to further quantify the accuracy of in vivo DT-MRI in revealing myocardial microstructure using novel tissue cleared 3D histology. The central hypothesis is that addressing these major technical challenges will allow for clinical translation of cardiac DT-MRI to serve as a tool to monitor the therapeutic effects of HF on microstructural remodeling. This is achieved by extending previously developed technologies used for myocardial fibrosis detection with diffusion-weighted MRI. The proposed project is designed to systematically develop an innovative and robust clinical DT-MRI methodology and rigorously validate in a pre-clinical setting the effects of exercise therapy on the microstructural remodeling of HF thereby laying the groundwork for potential optimization of dosing exercise therapy. Project Narrative This project ultimately aims at optimizing the non-invasive monitoring of exercise therapy in heart failure patients to potentially improve outcome. The research strategy is designed to systematically develop an innovative cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that overcomes major shortcomings of the conventional methods and aims at immediate clinical translation. Successful completion of this project will result in a clinically robust cardiac diffusion tensor MRI method that can effectively monitor the efficacy of exercise therapy and potentially improve treatment of heart failure.",Serial evaluation of cardioprotective effects of exercise training in heart failure using cardiac diffusion tensor MRI,10214689,R01HL151704,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Aerobic', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiac Myocytes', 'Cell Therapy', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dose', 'Echocardiography', 'Effectiveness', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Therapy', 'Exhibits', 'Family suidae', 'Fiber', 'Financial compensation', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Gold', 'Heart failure', 'Histology', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motion', 'Mus', 'Myocardial', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardium', 'Outcome', 'Pacemakers', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prevalence', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'RNA marker', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Signal Pathway', 'Slice', 'Structure', 'Tachycardia', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States', 'cardioprotection', 'clinical translation', 'clinically translatable', 'cohort', 'coronary fibrosis', 'denoising deep learning', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'exercise training', 'functional loss', 'heart function', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'preclinical study', 'preservation', 'prognostic tool', 'prognostic value', 'reconstruction', 'sedentary', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tomography', 'tool']",NHLBI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,673600
"Advancing MRI technology for early diagnosis of liver metastases Abstract Liver is commonly involved in metastatic disease in colorectal cancer (CRC) and knowledge about the presence and location of these tumors affects treatment decisions. In patients with CRC, surgical or ablative treatment of liver metastases improves overall survival. Early diagnosis of colorectal metastases (i.e. while lesions are small) is expected to improve treatment outcomes by increasing the number of subjects that can undergo surgical resection or by identifying subjects early on, when non-surgical options are an alternative treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is regarded as the most effective imaging modality for the detection and characterization of liver neoplasms; T2-weighted (T2w) and T1-weighted (T1w) images - combined with administration of a gadolinium chelate agent and multi-phase dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) - are the foundational acquisitions used for the detection and characterization of liver tumors. However, challenges remain for the detection and characterization of small lesions due to factors including inadequate spatial resolution, partial volume effects, physiological motion, and variations in timing of contrast arrival in DCE imaging. In this academic-industrial partnership the scientific and engineering teams at the University of Arizona and Siemens Medical Solutions are coming together to develop robust radial MRI techniques for T2w/T2 mapping and DCE imaging of the liver to improve detection and characterization of small tumors with the goal of bringing these techniques to routine clinical practice. The proposed work is based on a radial turbo spin- echo technique pioneered by the team at the University of Arizona for abdominal imaging and a radial stack-of-stars technique with continuous acquisition for DCE imaging. The specific aims of the partnership are: Aim 1: To develop radial T2w acquisition and reconstruction techniques with efficient full coverage of the liver for small tumor detection and accurate T2 quantification for tumor characterization. Aim 2: To implement a self-navigated 3D radial stack-of-stars technique for continuous acquisition of DCE data and retrospective reconstruction of the dynamic phases. Aim 3: To conduct a clinical evaluation of the techniques from Aims 1 and 2 against conventional T2w and DCE techniques. Aim 4: To streamline translation of the new radial methods to the clinic by developing a computationally efficient reconstruction pipeline. The endpoints of our study include technical advances in MRI acquisitions that markedly overcome limitations of current liver MRI for the diagnosis of early metastases. We expect our proposal to yield technology improvements that will increase precision of care and outcomes in patients with metastatic malignancies, in particular those with colorectal cancer. Project Narrative Liver metastases are common in colorectal cancer and knowledge of number, location and size impacts precision of therapy, survival and overall costs. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is commonly used for evaluating liver metastases but detection and diagnosis of small tumors remains challenging. Our proposal is based on a collaborative integrated team of university scientists, clinician-scientists and industry engineers to develop and clinically trial new MRI technology that overcomes limitations related to imaging small liver tumors in patients.",Advancing MRI technology for early diagnosis of liver metastases,10063981,R01CA245920,"['3-Dimensional', 'Abdomen', 'Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Arizona', 'Benign', 'Breathing', 'Cessation of life', 'Chelating Agents', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Colorectal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Country', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discrimination', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'Foundations', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Incidence', 'Industry', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Liver', 'Liver neoplasms', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Liver', 'Methods', 'Motion', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Precision therapeutics', 'Radial', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resectable', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Test Result', 'Translations', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Unresectable', 'Variant', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'alternative treatment', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'care outcomes', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'colon cancer patients', 'contrast enhanced', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'efficacy evaluation', 'flexibility', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'industry partner', 'liver imaging', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized care', 'reconstruction', 'research clinical testing', 'soft tissue', 'spatiotemporal', 'tumor', 'tumor specificity']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2021,536670
"Training in Structural, Physiologic and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Since its inception nearly five decades ago, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has continued to evolve and is far from having reached its ultimate potential. MRI is unquestionably the most complex but also the richest and most versatile imaging method, therefore requiring systematic training. Although inherently quantitative, MRI has been used largely as a qualitative imaging technique practiced by radiologists utilizing predominantly qualitative criteria for establishing a diagnosis or excluding disease. This approach is fraught with problems, its main limi- tation being the subjective nature of the result, i.e. sensitivity to reader experience and judgment. An increasing number of problems in medicine require a quantitative assessment of tissue structure, physiology and function. Moreover, for many diagnostic or staging problems quantification of an observation is not merely a better option but the qualitative approach is entirely unsuited. Examples are measurement of blood flow and perfusion, quan- tification of metabolite concentration by spectroscopic imaging and chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST), the assessment of non-focal systemic disorders such as degenerative neurologic or metabolic bone disease where a quantitative measurement of some structural or functional parameter has to be made. Over the years the modality has become ever more complex with the ongoing emergence of new methodologies, providing increasingly detailed insight into tissue function and metabolism. Recent years saw the development and inte- gration of advanced machine learning approaches for a variety of tasks including segmentation and computer assisted diagnosis. Successful participation in these developments demands in-depth, modality-specific training to enable future scientists to effectively deploy the myriad of mathematical tools for pulse sequence design and data reconstruction. Translation of new methods from the bench to the clinic is equally important and highlighted as one of NIH’s key priorities. The training process therefore needs to be multidisciplinary, requiring close coop- eration among MR physicists, engineers, computer scientists and physicians in the various subspecialties. Basic science trainees often understand the medical problem incompletely and typically have difficulties in translating abstract technical concepts to the practicing physician. The proposed training program builds on the director’s earlier program and its record in terms of achieved training outcome, showing the large majority of former train- ees having attained academic faculty or senior research positions in industry. The new program builds on this successful formula by proposing to train four predoctoral candidates in MRI physics and engineering, with par- ticular focus on structural, physiologic and functional applications, for a period of two years. Training modalities involve a combination of colloquia, structured teaching and hands-on laboratory training, and emphasis on pre- ceptor-directed research. The training faculty covers a broad spectrum of expertise in multidisciplinary research training as well as basic and translational research excellence. PROJECT NARRATIVE The complexity of MRI, its multiparametric nature, and its myriad embodiments for the study of tissue structure, physiology and function, require systematic, modality-specific training. The proposed program entails all aspects of training physics and engineering concepts for MRI image acquisition, reconstruction and processing, in com- bination with preceptor-directed research.","Training in Structural, Physiologic and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging",10171726,T32EB020087,"['Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Physiological', 'Structure', 'Training']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,T32,2021,198832
"Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T Project Summary The goal of this project is to develop a framework for high-performance parallel transmission (pTx) that is trans- ferable to a wide range of MRI scanners, and apply it to push the spatial encoding limits of echo planar imaging (EPI) at 7 Tesla. EPI is by far the most widely used pulse sequence for rapid functional, diffusion, and perfusion imaging, and has been the focus of considerable development in recent years to increase its speed and spatial resolution. Now there is a strong desire to push EPI's spatial resolution down to the micro scale. For functional MRI (fMRI), this would enable imaging of ﬁne structures (layers, columns, and nuclei) of cortical and subcortical architecture while better resolving the hemodynamic response. For diffusion MRI (dMRI), micro scale EPI would improve surface and laminar analysis of ﬁbers in the cortex, as well as brain parcelation using fractional anisotropy differences between gray matter regions, while broadly reducing partial volume effects. It would further enable EPI to be broadly applied to accelerate anatomic scans that are geometrically matched to fMRI and dMRI scans. However, increasing the resolution of single-shot EPI requires longer readouts which extend echo times and re- duce functional contrast in fMRI and signal-to-noise in dMRI at 7 Tesla, while increasing geometric distortions and blurring. Segmented or multishot EPI is a classic method to increase spatial resolution without increasing readout durations, but is underutilized, primarily due to its high sensitivity to motion and dynamic phase changes between shots which cause large image artifacts.  We propose to develop a new multishot EPI technique called shuttered EPI, which addresses the lim- itations of conventional multishot EPI by imaging a set of spatially disjoint shutters in each shot. The shutters are produced by a multidimensional excitation pulse and are spatially shifted between shots to cover an entire slice. However, with thin slices the length of the excitation pulses are impractical (20-100 ms). Many-coil pTx (> 8 coils) can shorten the length of these pulses to feasible durations, but current 7 Tesla scanners have only 8 transmit channels due to cost, footprint, cabling, and other constraints. In the ﬁrst project period we pioneered a technique called array-compressed pTx (acpTx) which overcomes this limitation. Using acpTx, 8 transmit chan- nels can control an arbitrarily large number of coils, where the channels and coils are connected via an array compression network that is optimized with RF pulses for speciﬁc excitations. In this project, we will develop and apply acpTx methods and hardware (a many-coil head transmit array and an 8 channel-to-many coil array com- pression network) to achieve feasible RF pulse durations when exciting the shutter patterns required for shuttered EPI. These developments will be implemented on two major 7T scanner platforms and evaluated in submillimeter (600 micron) fMRI and dMRI acquisitions. Overall, the project encompasses the synergistic design of RF pulses, hardware, acquisitions and reconstructions to achieve a major advance in spatial encoding. Project Narrative Diffusion and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 7 Tesla ﬁeld strength using echo planar imaging (EPI) has the potential to deliver clear images of brain structure and function at the level of layers, columns, and nuclei. However, when existing EPI scans are pushed to the spatial resolutions required to resolve these structures, they become highly sensitive to off resonance-induced geometric distortions, relaxation-induced blur- ring, physiological noise and motion. To address this problem, in this project we will develop many-coil array- compressed parallel transmission and apply it to enable shuttered multishot EPI scans that are robust to these effects.",Array-Compressed Parallel Transmission for High Resolution Neuroimaging at 7T,10093035,R01EB016695,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Anisotropy', 'Architecture', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elements', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Homebound Persons', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Length', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Problem Formulations', 'Relaxation', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thinness', 'Time', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cost', 'design', 'gray matter', 'hemodynamics', 'image reconstruction', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'motion sensitivity', 'neuroimaging', 'perfusion imaging', 'phase change', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'time use', 'transmission process', 'virtual']",NIBIB,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,558172
"Bridging diffusion MRI and chemical tracing for validation and inference of fiber architectures Project summary: This project will collect a unique, multi-modal, multi-contrast dataset with tracer injections and diffusion MRI in the same macaque brains. We will use this dataset to develop novel algorithms for inferring local fiber architectures from diffusion MRI. The goal is to overcome the limitations of current methods for diffusion orientation reconstruction, which are designed to resolve fiber crossings but not to distinguish between crossings and other configurations, such as branching, turning, fanning, etc. More broadly, the proposed dataset will allow us to investigate organizational principles of brain pathways and to provide a testbed for the neuroimaging community to evaluate the accuracy of diffusion tractography and microstructural modeling techniques. The project is a collaboration between groups with extensive expertise in diffusion MRI methodological development (MGH Martinos Center) and anatomical tracer studies (University of Rochester). We have previously collected high-resolution ex vivo diffusion MRI data on a set of macaque brains that had also received tracer injections. We have recently used these data in an open tractography challenge, with the participation of research teams from around the world. This was the first challenge of its kind to provide diffusion MRI data suitable for all state-of-the-art diffusion reconstruction methods (e.g., multi-shell or Cartesian grid sampling), in addition to providing the tracer injections in the same brains as the MRI scans. Our own preliminary studies and the challenge itself offer several insights into the performance of state-of-the-art tractography methods. For example, our results indicate that, while most tractography methods would require their parameters to be tuned differently to achieve optimal accuracy for different cortical seed regions, there are approaches that are robust across cortical areas. Furthermore, our results suggest that errors occur frequently in areas where the fiber architecture is not well modeled by a crossing. Thus there is a need for novel tractography approaches that go beyond the crossing-fiber paradigm. Here we propose to develop such an approach. Our prior work included injection sites in the frontal, prefrontal, and cingulate cortices only. Here we propose to investigate the extent to which our prior findings generalize across the brain, by performing tracer injections that sample a wider range of cortical areas. Furthermore, we will extend our acquisition protocol to acquire data appropriate not only for tractography, but also for microstructural and myelin mapping. These data will allow us to answer a broader range of questions about tractography, microstructure, and their intersection. Beyond the methodological development proposed in this project, the data will also be an invaluable resource to the neuroimaging community, providing researchers with a framework for the objective assessment of current diffusion MRI analysis methods and identifying areas for improvement to guide the development of next-generation techniques. Project narrative: This project will study organizational principles of brain pathways with a combination of chemical tracing and diffusion MRI. The ultimate goal is to assess and improve the accuracy of diffusion MRI, which is currently the only technique for imaging these pathways non-invasively and studying their role in the healthy and diseased brain in vivo. The unique dataset collected by this project will provide a testbed that can aid the neuroimaging research community in identifying shortcomings of current diffusion MRI analysis techniques and provide guidance towards seeking alternative approaches that overcome these shortcomings.",Bridging diffusion MRI and chemical tracing for validation and inference of fiber architectures,10099935,R01NS119911,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Caliber', 'Chemicals', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Error Sources', 'Exhibits', 'Fiber', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Injections', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Macaca', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monkeys', 'Myelin', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Seeds', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tracer', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'anatomical tracing', 'automated algorithm', 'brain pathway', 'cingulate cortex', 'convolutional neural network', 'data acquisition', 'deep learning', 'design', 'frontal lobe', 'histological stains', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'reconstruction', 'sample fixation', 'synergism', 'targeted treatment', 'tool', 'tractography']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,666884
"Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI Project Abstract Motivation: This is a competing renewal of our successful project, Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI, R01 EB009690. MRI offers superb soft tissue contrast for children, without the ionizing radiation and cancer risk of CT. However, MRI use has been limited due to long exams, low spatial resolution, and motion-artifacts. Thus, MRI often requires prolonged anesthesia with breath-holds and attendant risk; hence, children often lack the beneﬁts of cross-sectional imaging altogether or are exposed to ionizing radiation. The previous project addressed these concerns by creating a dedicated pediatric imaging system. Highly par- allel, high-SNR 3T receive coil arrays were designed and constructed speciﬁcally for pediatric body imaging. The high SNR was used to accelerate scans reconstructed with a combination of parallel imaging, new mo- tion correction algorithms, compressed sensing (CS), and higher dimensional imaging. The resulting system is now being used extensively in clinical practice, signiﬁcantly reducing anesthesia depth and duration, and has markedly increased our MRI utilization. Key technologies have been or are now being commercialized with GE Healthcare, including the pediatric receive array, CS, 4D ﬂow, full-Fourier single-shot T2-weighted scanning, and coil compression. Siemens has licensed ﬁve of our patents, implemented them in work-in-progress packages, and productized our coil compression and our ESPIRiT coil sensitivity estimation. Philips has licensed three of our patents. This ensures broad impact. Approach: Despite signiﬁcant progress and reduced anesthesia depth and duration, patient cooperation re- mains the main limitation to eliminate anesthesia in all pediatric body MRI exams. Many children will cooperate for several minutes, but then ﬁdget and get out of the scanner. Others are content until acoustic noise agi- tates them. Therefore the major emphasis now is greater exam execution speed, comprehensive elimination of acoustic noise, and increased robustness, particularly to contrast agent injection. The project has three interrelated development aims, validated by clinical studies. Aim 1 will enable fast 2D imag- ing for quiet T2 and quiet low-distortion diffusion weighted imaging. A second aim is to develop free-breathing 3D contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted imaging that is silent and motion-robust. The third aim will enable au- tomated, smart scanning to speed the exam execution and adaptive protocols to increase the exam robustness. The impact of all of these developments in the clinic will then be assessed to assess the resulting reduction of anesthesia. Signiﬁcance: This work will lead to fast, robust, broadly-applicable pediatric MRI protocols with less anes- thesia, making MRI safer, cheaper, and more available to children. MRI will be transformed into a workhorse modality, reducing CT radiation burden. The techniques will facilitate wide application in the community setting and permit new MRI applications, for both pediatric and adult diseases. Project Narrative Pediatric MRI often requires anesthesia. After considerable progress reducing the depth and duration of anes- thesia, this work aims to reduce the frequency of anesthesia through a synergistic combination of fast, quiet, motion-robust, automated, and adaptive scanning. This will make MRI safer, cheaper, and more widely available to children, reducing the population risk of radiation from CT.",Rapid Robust Pediatric MRI,10155483,R01EB009690,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Body part', 'Bolus Infusion', 'Breathing', 'Child', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Computational Technique', 'Consumption', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exposure to', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Image', 'Image Compression', 'Image Enhancement', 'Injections', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Legal patent', 'Letters', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Motivation', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Pediatric Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Radiation', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Speed', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'community setting', 'compliance behavior', 'contrast enhanced', 'data quality', 'design and construction', 'experience', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient tolerability', 'pediatric patients', 'programs', 'radiation risk', 'reconstruction', 'skills', 'soft tissue', 'volunteer']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,631942
"Harmonization of Multi-Site Neuroimaging Data from Complex Study Designs PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past decade, the number of large multi-center neuroimaging studies has skyrocketed due to growing investments by federal governments and private entities interested in brain development, aging, and pathology. This has led to the accumulation of vast amounts of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data which have been acquired with varying amounts of technical harmonization. Such efforts, which have focused on protocol harmonization and comparisons with imaging phantoms, have shown great strides toward reducing inter- scanner differences in imaging features extracted for further study. Unfortunately, MRI show inter-instrument biases even in the most carefully controlled studies. Our group, among many others, has shown that these differences often dwarf biological differences of interest measured using both structural and functional MRI.  To address this, the field has rapidly been developing tools for the harmonization of imaging data after acquisition. We have proposed several such tools, and our work has often focused on the adaptation of methods used in genomic studies for batch effect correction. Our most recent such work involved the ComBat method, which uses empirical Bayesian estimation to correct for site effects in both means and variances of imaging features under study. To date, these tools have been successfully applied in studies of cortical thickness, white matter microstructure, and functional connectivity. However, there are unfortunately several key limitations to the ComBat method for imaging studies that stem from its original conception for gene expression studies.  ComBat was designed for the study of inter-scanner differences in cross-sectionally acquired data. While cross-sectional studies are of great interest and exceedingly common, much focus in the context of healthy brain development and aging has shifted to measuring longitudinal trajectories. In such cases, the naïve application of ComBat is flawed and methodological research is necessary for appropriate harmonization tools to be developed. Furthermore, more complex nested study design in which multiple scanners are used per institution, or a subset of subjects are imaged on multiple scanners for harmonization purposes, are increasingly common. Another key area of interest in modern neuroimaging studies is to focus on inter-region structural or functional connectivity and uses multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to improve our understanding of phenotypic associations as well as for personalized predictions. Unfortunately, the current state-of-the-art in image harmonization ignores correlation structure between measurements, and thus inter- scanner differences often persist.  In this project, we propose a new generation of techniques that are applicable under complex study designs and harmonize appropriately for studies involving applications of MVPA. In our final aim of this proposal, we will apply the methods developed for more complex study designs and MVPA in the context of two of the largest NIH-funded multi-center consortia across the lifespan. PROJECT NARRATIVE Over the past decade, the number of large multi-center neuroimaging studies has skyrocketed due to growing investments by federal governments and private entities interested in brain development, aging, and pathology. This has led to the accumulation of vast amounts of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data acquired using various study designs, but the statistical methodology necessary for harmonizing these data for integrated analyses is currently lacking. In this project, we propose to develop, implement, and apply next-generation imaging harmonization methods for data acquired longitudinally or from more complex study designs, as well as appropriate harmonization methods for use in conjunction with popular multivariate pattern analysis techniques.",Harmonization of Multi-Site Neuroimaging Data from Complex Study Designs,10188649,R01MH123550,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Advocate', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Conceptions', 'Controlled Study', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Dwarfism', 'Federal Government', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Gold', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Institution', 'Intelligence', 'Investments', 'Liquid substance', 'Location', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multicenter Studies', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Privatization', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Design', 'Research Methodology', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Travel', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'cognitive development', 'combat', 'complex data', 'data harmonization', 'design', 'gray matter', 'healthy aging', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'instrument', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'predictive modeling', 'stem', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,603870
"Quantitative and Spectroscopic Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Changes in Sarcopenia at High Field Project Summary Sarcopenia, a condition characterized by loss of muscle mass and function in the elderly, is of increasing relevance in the United States due to its aging population. It is generally agreed that the weakening of the muscle in sarcopenia cannot be explained by loss of muscle mass alone, but the mechanisms behind this remain poorly understood. This is partly due to the lack of non-invasive techniques for observing muscle structure and composition in high detail. We propose to develop MRI techniques to measure muscle morphology, microstructure, and fat content to get a detailed view of the changes in muscle quantity and quality in patients with sarcopenia and how they relate to more easily attainable measurements of muscle function such as grip strength and gait speed. This would provide an important contribution to the ongoing debate about how such measurements could be used to define sarcopenia, which would pave the way for treatment development. We aim to develop novel methods to investigate the structure and composition of muscle using ultra-high-field MRI. Specifically, we aim to (1) obtain water-based images of skeletal muscle macro- and microstructure with unparalleled efficiency, image quality, and resolution; (2) obtain images of the spatial distribution of intramyocellular lipids in skeletal muscle, measuring both methyl and methylene to estimate saturation; and (3) to conduct a study comparing skeletal muscle structure and quality by looking at MR measurements of T2 relaxation rates, diffusivity (as proxies for inflammation and fiber size, respectively), fat fraction, and lipid composition, in subjects with sarcopenia and healthy controls and see how these quantities correlate to muscle function. This project has several innovative aspects. First, we will develop a method to estimate muscle morphology, T2 relaxation rates, and diffusivity with a single MRI sequence. Importantly, this will make the developed method easy to run at other MRI sites. Second, we will devise methods to perform robust, efficient imaging of intramyocellular lipid droplet distribution and saturation in human skeletal muscle in vivo at high field. Both of these methods will have unparalleled signal-to-noise ratio and robustness against image artifacts. The significance of this work is the investigation of the role of inflammation, fiber size, and lipid distribution in the weakening of muscle in sarcopenia and how these measurements are related to muscle function. The resulting conclusions and techniques may help establish a common standard for the definition of sarcopenia and aid in the development of future treatments for this condition. Project Narrative Sarcopenia, the loss of muscle mass and function with age, is a condition bound to increase in prevalence with an aging population. The muscle changes involved include not only reduction in mass but also changes in muscle quality not easily visualized with current methods. This work aims to develop efficient MRI techniques to investigate these changes in better detail, improving scientific understanding of the mechanisms of sarcopenia and how they relate to muscle function.",Quantitative and Spectroscopic Imaging of Skeletal Muscle Changes in Sarcopenia at High Field,10125507,K99AG066815,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Fracture', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Gait speed', 'Geriatrics', 'Goals', 'Hand Strength', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Hospitalization', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Inflammation', 'Investigation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Lipids', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Marker', 'Methods', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Muscle', 'Muscle function', 'Muscular Atrophy', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Protons', 'Proxy', 'Relaxation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Running', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skeletal Muscle', 'Soleus Muscle', 'Spatial Distribution', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'United States', 'Water', 'Work', 'aging population', 'base', 'bone imaging', 'carbene', 'clinical biomarkers', 'design', 'falls', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'muscle form', 'muscle strength', 'muscular structure', 'novel', 'potential biomarker', 'quantitative imaging', 'radio frequency', 'recruit', 'sarcopenia', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'therapy development']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2021,114480
"In vivo dual-axis confocal microscopy of 5-ALA-induced PpIX to guide low-grade glioma resections Summary Extent-of-resection is correlated with glioma patient outcomes such as progression-free survival. Image- guidance technologies, based on MRI and now fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS), have been developed to improve the surgeon’s ability to visualize gross tumor margins. However, there are fundamental limitations to wide-field imaging methods such as MRI and FGS, such as poor sensitivity to detect disseminated tumor cells at the infiltrative margins of diffuse gliomas, as well as the non-quantitative and subjective nature of image interpretation. With the emergence of FGS using 5-ALA, and its recent approval by the FDA in 2017, the gap between low-grade glioma (LGG) and high-grade glioma (HGG) patients, in terms of extent of resection, will likely widen since LGGs rarely generate sufficient PpIX fluorescence to be detected via wide-field FGS. Consequently, there is a clear need for improved intraoperative techniques with the sensitivity to detect and quantify residual LGGs at the margins of the tumor cavity in order to improve the extent of resection and delay recurrence. We have shown that high-resolution confocal microscopy has the sensitivity to visualize the sparse sub-cellular expression of PpIX in LGG patients treated with 5-ALA, even beyond the radiographic margins. Therefore, we will optimize a handheld optical-sectioning microscope to image 5-ALA-induced PpIX at the final resection margins in LGG patients, together with real-time video mosaicking to facilitate the imaging of large tissue areas, which will minimize sampling bias when imaging heterogeneous brain tissues (Aim 1). In order to facilitate the clinical acceptance of these techniques, we will establish a relationship between the microscopic patterns of PpIX expression and well-established biological metrics such as tumor burden and proliferative index (Aim 2). Finally, we will explore the hypothesis that quantitative microscopic imaging of PpIX of the resection margins is predictive of extent of resection, as currently defined by post-operative MRI, which would suggest that it has value for optimizing resections to minimize and/or delay recurrence (Aim 3). Collectively, these results will pave the way for future randomized controlled clinical studies to optimize resection procedures and outcomes for LGG patients (adults and children), many of whom can have good survival outcomes and quality of life. Relevance to public health We are developing a set of technologies to enable real-time intraoperative microscopy of the final resection margins of low-grade glioma (LGG) patients who have been administered with 5-ALA prior to surgery (FDA approved in 2017). These quantitative and sensitive imaging techniques have the potential to improve the extent of resection for LGG patients, and therefore to improve patient outcomes such as overall survival and progression-free survival (time to recurrence).",In vivo dual-axis confocal microscopy of 5-ALA-induced PpIX to guide low-grade glioma resections,10146311,R01CA244170,"['Adult', 'Aminolevulinic Acid', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biophotonics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffuse', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Fluorescence', 'Future', 'Glioma', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Institutes', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neuronavigation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Proliferation Marker', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Randomized', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'S-Phase Fraction', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Biases', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Sterility', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical margins', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Tumor Burden', 'Validation', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'fluorescence-guided surgery', 'high resolution imaging', 'image guided', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'lens', 'microscopic imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'overexpression', 'prototype', 'survival outcome', 'tumor']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2021,579585
"Integrating Quantitative MRI and Artificial Intelligence to Improve Prostate Cancer Classification PROJECT SUMMARY Prostate cancer (PCa) develops in sixteen percent of males and is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in men in the United States. While incidence is high, PCa presents with a wide range of aggressiveness and in many cases does not develop into life-threatening aggressive cancer. Current diagnostic strategies may fail to detect all instances of clinically significant PCa and have limited ability to accurately distinguish clinically significant from indolent PCa due to incomplete and inconsistent information. This not only subjects patients to detrimental co-morbidities including overtreatment and undertreatment, but also exacerbates already significant healthcare costs. Consequently, there is an urgent clinical need to achieve accurate detection and classification of clinically significant PCa and determine the appropriate management strategy. Multi-parametric MRI (mp-MRI), consisting of T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, has emerged as the preferred imaging technique for non-invasive detection and grading of PCa. However, the current standardized scoring system for mp-MRI, Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v2, has limited ability to distinguish between indolent and clinically significant PCa, with sensitivity and specificity in the range of 60-85%. This suboptimal accuracy and considerable variation in performance is mainly due to the fact that current PI-RADS scoring is based on qualitative analysis and subjective interpretation of mp-MRI, confounded by scanner- and patient-specific variations, including B1+ inhomogeneity, arterial input function, and susceptibility and eddy current effects. This proposal aims to overcome these critical limitations of current mp-MRI by establishing a new MRI-based artificial intelligence based on two synergistic innovations: 1) new quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI analysis techniques and diffusion-weighted MRI acquisition methods that minimize scanner- and patient-specific variations, and 2) novel multi-class deep learning models that can fully integrate the multi-labeled quantitative mp- MRI information. By leveraging the synergy between existing mp-MRI data and to-be-acquired quantitative mp- MRI data with subsequent mapping of all lesions at whole-mount histopathology, the proposed MRI-based deep learning model will be evaluated for detection and classification of clinically significant PCa, compared with the current standard-of-care, PI-RADS v2. Completion of this project will lead to the creation, clinical deployment, and pivotal validation of a new MRI-based artificial intelligence that achieves unprecedented accuracy for detection and classification of clinically significant PCa, thereby increasing confidence in separating indolent PCa from significant PCa and reducing unnecessary biopsies, undertreatment, and overtreatment. PROJECT NARRATIVE Current diagnostic strategies can fail to accurately detect and classify clinically significant prostate cancer, leading to detrimental overtreatment and undertreatment. This research project aims to jointly develop and integrate innovative quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and artificial intelligence algorithms to achieve significantly improved accuracy for detection and classification of clinically significant prostate cancer. The new MRI- based artificial intelligence will be a transformative technology to reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies and enhance decision making for patient management to avoid overtreatment and undertreatment of prostate cancer.",Integrating Quantitative MRI and Artificial Intelligence to Improve Prostate Cancer Classification,10115677,R01CA248506,"['Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Incidence', 'Indolent', 'Information Systems', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Non-Invasive Cancer Detection', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Predisposition', 'Prostate', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Project Grants', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Texture', 'Uncertainty', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'cancer classification', 'clinically significant', 'comorbidity', 'contrast enhanced', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'design', 'diffusion weighted', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'intelligent algorithm', 'male', 'men', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'prisma', 'prospective', 'prostate biopsy', 'standard of care', 'synergism']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2021,544992
"Next-Generation Cardiovascular MRI powered by Artificial Intelligence Project Summary/Abstract: Despite the accuracy and versatility of cardiovascular MRI, its footprint is only 1% among cardiac imaging tests (SPECT, echocardiography, CT, MRI) in the US. While there are several factors such as referral patterns favoring SPECT and echocardiography among cardiologists that account for low utilization, the two addressable obstacles that preclude widespread adoption are lengthy scan time (imaging facility operational cost) and reading (physician cost). These obstacles must be addressed for community hospitals with limited resources to adopt cardiovascular MRI into clinical routine practice. While compressed sensing (CS), since its introduction into the MRI world in 2007, has led to highly-accelerated cardiovascular MRI acquisitions, the subsequent image reconstruction remains too slow (> 5 min for 2D time series, > 1 hour for 3D time series) for clinical translation (unmet need 1). Downstream, image analysis for cardiovascular MRI is notoriously labor intensive (e.g. 30- to 60-min) and limited (“circles” at two cardiac phases for cine MRI, whereas perfusion and late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) images are evaluated visually), for what is essentially a basic computer vision task (unmet need 2). In direct response, we will address these two unmet needs and unlock the enormous potential of CMR using deep learning (DL). DL applications have exploded since advancements in optimization and GPU hardware. While several recent studies have applied neural networks such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), U-Nets, and Generative Adversarial Nets (GANs) for reconstruction and segmentation, no study has implemented an inline end-to-end pipeline that receives raw k-space from the MRI scanner and delivers both reconstructed images and fully processed images automatically with high speed (< 1 min). The objectives of this study are: a) developing a network for image reconstruction with maximal acceleration (aim 1), (b) developing a network for image processing tasks (aim 2), and c) developing an integrated, end-to-end network that does both (aim 3). By developing an architecture that can simultaneously learn maximal acceleration, fine tune end-to-end performance, and perform reconstruction/inference using feed-forward networks, we anticipate a disruptive technology that will lead to a paradigm shift in cardiovascular MRI and increase its footprint in community hospitals. This 2-year study is doable because of the requisite database of raw k-space (not derived from DICOM) data (N = 617) and annotated cardiac MR images (N=3,021) from over 3,000 patients existing at our institution. Success of this proposal will deliver a disruptive technology that has potential to cause a paradigm shift in cardiovascular MRI and enable widespread adoption of cardiovascular MRI into clinical routine practice. PROJECT NARRATIVE: The goal of this proposal is to develop a new-generation cardiovascular MRI technology empowered by artificial intelligence, more specifically deep learning. The proposed technology accurately reconstructs cardiovascular images and segments cardiac regions of interest within 1 min without any human intervention.

"Artificial Intelligence Boosted Evolution and Detection of Genetically Encoded Reporters for In Vivo Imaging PROJECT SUMMARY Magnetic resonance (MR) reporter genes have the potential to monitor transgene expression non-invasively in real time at high resolution. These genes can be applied to interrogate the efficacy of gene therapy, to monitor viral therapeutics and viral gene delivery, to assess cellular differentiation, cell trafficking, and specific metabolic activity, and also assess changes in the microenvironment. Efforts toward the development of MR reporter genes have been made for over a decade, but, despite these efforts, the field is still in its early developmental stage. This reflects the fact that there are numerous complications, caused by the low sensitivity of detection, the need for substrates with their associated undesirable pharmacokinetics, and/or the difficult and, in some cases, delayed interpretation of signal changes. We have previously demonstrated that many of these challenges can be overcome with the use of a lysine rich protein (LRP) reporter gene, that is detectable by chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI. However, to mature the CEST reporter gene technology and bring it towards clinical translation, its sensitivity and specificity need to be improved. In particular, the LRP reporter gene specificity is limited by the fact that the lysine amide exchangeable protons of LRP have the same chemical shift as amide protons from endogenous proteins. It is therefore difficult to distinguish the reporter CEST contrast from the background CEST contrast, both of which may be changing with time. The specificity is further limited by the sensitivity of the CEST contrast to intracellular pH where the qualitative CEST contrast cannot distinguish between exchange rate and concentration effects. Finally, a decrease in cytosolic pH, observed in many disease pathologies, reduces the amide proton exchange rate and hence the CEST reporter sensitivity. We therefore propose to develop improved MRI reporter genes and quantitative MRI detection methods that will facilitate the clinical translation of these methods for imaging biological therapeutics, such as oncolytic virotherapy. We hypothesize that CEST reporter genes with improved sensitivity and specificity along with improved quantitative CEST methods will enable viral infection and replication to be monitored longitudinally throughout OV tumor therapy. To test this hypothesis and establish the clinical potential of MRI reporter genes we will capitalize on two transformative technologies developed in our labs; (Aim 1) an artificial intelligence based genetic programming algorithm will be used for optimizing the sensitivity and specificity of the CEST reporter gene and (Aim 2) a CEST magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) method will be used for the rapid quantification of both the reporter protein concentration and chemical exchange rate. (Aim 3) These methods will be validated for imaging oncolytic viral infection and replication in mouse glioblastoma tumor models. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cell and viral based therapies have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of many diseases. However, the optimization of such biological therapies depends critically on the ability to monitor the spread and persistence of the therapeutic agent and assess the tissue response. This project therefore proposes to develop and optimize a novel MRI reporter gene technology that allows for the imaging of biological therapeutics.

"Ultra-Fast Knee MRI with Deep Learning ABSTRACT Fast, robust and reliable quantitative knee joint MR imaging would be a significant step forward in studying joint degeneration, injury and osteoarthritis (OA). Automation of compositional and morphological feature extraction of the tissues in the knee it is an essential step for translation to clinical practice of promising quantitative techniques. It would enable the analysis of large patient cohorts and assist the radiologist/clinician in augmenting the value of MRI. Automation of several human tasks has been achieved in the last few years by the usage of Deep Learning techniques. With the availability of large amounts of annotated data and processing power, using the concepts of transforming data to knowledge by the observation of examples, supervised learning can today accomplish challenges never demonstrated before. In addition to image analysis and interpretation, Deep Learning is revolutionizing the acquisition and reconstruction aspects of the pipeline. Models can learn a direct mapping between under sampled k-space and image domain. While Deep Learning application to musculoskeletal imaging showed promising results when applied in a controlled setting, it is well understood that generalization beyond the statistical distribution of the training set is still an unmet challenge. In MRI this translates into poor performances when trained models are tested on different imaging protocols or images acquired on different MRI systems. With this proposal, we aim to leverage on this recent advancement and filling the existing gaps. We aim to study novel integrated models able to simultaneously accelerate MRI acquisition and automate the image processing that can overcome the limitation of single domain application. Fast image acquisition and accurate image post processing are typically considered to be separate problems. However, the neural networks optimization design gives us an opportunity to integrate the two to maximize both acceleration and machine-based image processing and interpretation. We will use both publicly available benchmark dataset (FastMRI) and internally collected dataset to build deep learning models able to accurately reconstruct under sampled MRI acquisitions. We will use a dataset prospectively acquired during the course of this study to validate the clinical applicability of the developed methods. Specifically, we will test the hypothesis that the proposed integrated pipeline can be applied in clinical setting for a fast and intelligent knee scan obtaining image quality comparable to standard acquisition and automated processing accuracy comparable with human reproducibility. Additionally, we propose to make our annotated image datasets and trained models a shared resource, a centralized, open evaluation platform for MRI reconstruction and image post processing techniques. NARRATIVE This study aims to use Deep Learning to simultaneously accelerate knee MRI acquisition and automate post processing pipelines including multi tissue segmentation, detection and severity staging of osteoarthritis degenerative changes. The proposed study builds a novel translational platform to revolutionize knee MR images in research studies, but also is paradigm-shifting in that it may provide a first step towards on real time automatic image inspection and personalized imaging protocolling.",Ultra-Fast Knee MRI with Deep Learning,10177641,R01AR078762,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Benchmarking', 'Cartilage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Evaluation', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Injury', 'Intelligence', 'Knee', 'Knee joint', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Licensing', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Patient Triage', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Distributions', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Uncertainty', 'Vendor', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'computerized data processing', 'convolutional neural network', 'data space', 'data to knowledge', 'deep learning', 'density', 'design', 'domain mapping', 'experimental study', 'feature extraction', 'heterogenous data', 'image processing', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging system', 'joint destruction', 'learning ability', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'open source', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'recruit', 'research study', 'sensor', 'supervised learning', 'tool', 'validation studies']",NIAMS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2021,574344
"Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning Project Summary/Abstract  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and throughout the world. In 2017, CLD had an age-adjusted death rate of 10.9/100,000 total population and an estimated lifetime cost of fatty liver disease alone in the U.S. of ~$222 billion. Liver fibrosis (LF) is the most important and only histologic feature known to predict outcomes from CLD. The current standard for assessing LF is biopsy, which is costly, prone to sampling error, and invasive with poor patient acceptance. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for noninvasive, highly accurate and precise diagnostic technologies for detection and quantification of LF. Our overarching objective is to apply Deep Learning (DL) methods using conventional non-elastographic magnetic resonance (MR) images, MR elastography (MRE), and clinical data to accurately detect and measure LF in children and adults with CLD, using biopsy-derived histologic data as the reference standard. In this project, we will dedicate our efforts to accomplishing the following specific aims. In Aim 1, we will develop and validate a DL framework to accurately segment liver and spleen in order to extract radiomic (gray-scale signal intensity distribution, shape and morphology, volumetry, and inter-voxel signal intensity pattern and texture) and deep features (complex abstractions of patterns non-linearly constructed throughout the transformation estimated by data-driven DL training procedures) from conventional multiparametric MRI. These features allow detection of liver and spleen structural abnormalities/tissue aberrations. In Aim 2, we will develop and validate an “ensemble” DL model (LFNet) to predict biopsy-derived LF stage and LF percentage using the integration of conventional multimodal MRI radiomic and deep features, MRE data, as well as clinical data. In Aim 3, we will develop and validate a DL model (LSNet) to quantify MRE-derived liver stiffness (LS) using conventional multiparametric MRI radiomic and deep features as well as clinical data. The proposed models will help physicians to more accurately detect and follow CLD by 1) quantifying LS from conventional MR imaging without the need for MRE; and, more importantly, 2) predicting histologic LF stage and LF percentage without the need for biopsy, while avoiding inter- radiologist variability, reducing radiologist workload, and ultimately reducing healthcare costs. We will validate the models using both internal and independent external data from various scanners and sites. The techniques we develop are expected to improve medical diagnosis and prognostication in the same way as DL has revolutionized other fields. This study will significantly impact public health because it will allow physicians and researchers to more accurately diagnose and quantify CLD and LF as well as permit more frequent assessments in a noninvasive, patient-centric manner, thus potentially improving patient outcomes while lowering healthcare costs. The techniques we develop also can be readily extended for the prediction of other important liver-related clinical outcomes, including impending complications such as portal hypertension, time to liver transplant/transplant listing, and mortality risk, among others. Project Narrative  Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a common cause of illness and death worldwide, and it is a significant healthcare and financial burden. Liver fibrosis (LF) is a measurable feature of CLD that is important to assess the severity of disease, evaluate for progression and therapy response, and predict outcomes. We propose to apply artificial intelligence methods to noninvasive conventional magnetic resonance images and readily- available clinical data for accurate detection and quantification of LF, thus significantly impacting public health by facilitating personalized therapies without the need for liver biopsy, improved outcomes, and lower healthcare costs.",Quantification of Liver Fibrosis with MRI and Deep Learning,10096229,R01EB030582,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'American', 'Appearance', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bilirubin', 'Biopsy', 'Body mass index', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Complex', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Death Rate', 'Decision Making', 'Descriptor', 'Detection', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Eye', 'Fatty Liver', 'Financial Hardship', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Healthcare', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Laboratories', 'Length of Stay', 'Liver', 'Liver Fibrosis', 'Liver diseases', 'Magnetic Resonance Elastography', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Portal Hypertension', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Residual state', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Running', 'Sampling Errors', 'Series', 'Severity of illness', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spleen', 'Staging', 'Structural defect', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transplantation', 'Vendor', 'Viral hepatitis', 'Visual', 'Workload', 'accurate diagnosis', 'accurate diagnostics', 'chronic liver disease', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical risk', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'diagnostic technologies', 'elastography', 'hospital readmission', 'hospitalization rates', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'life time cost', 'liver biopsy', 'liver transplantation', 'mortality', 'mortality risk', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'non-linear transformation', 'outcome prediction', 'personalized diagnostics', 'personalized medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'radiologist', 'radiomics', 'response', 'sex']",NIBIB,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R01,2021,628266
"Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking PROJECT SUMMARY  Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures tissue parameters such as T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion to detect subtle differences in tissue states (such as microstructure, diffuse fibrosis, edema, hemorrhage, and iron content) from neurological, oncological, and cardiovascular diseases. Because each parameter offers complementary tissue information, multiparameter mapping is very promising for risk assessment, early detection, accurate staging, and treatment monitoring of disease. However, quantitative MRI is typically very time consuming and difficult to perform. Each parameter is typically measured from its own series of images, so measuring multiple parameters leads to long, inefficient scanning sessions. Furthermore, cardiac and breathing motion creates misalignment between images, causing additional problems.  The standard approach to motion is to either remove it (e.g., ask the patient to hold their breath) or to synchronize image acquisition with it (e.g., using electrocardiography (ECG) to monitor cardiac motion). This approach makes scan times even longer, limits imaging to patients who can repeatedly perform long breath holds (which is difficult for aging or weak patients) and who have predictable cardiac motion (which is not true of patients with cardiac arrhythmias). Furthermore, these methods are often unreliable and difficult to perform.  This project is to develop and validate a new technology, MR Multitasking, to perform multiple simultaneous measurements in a single, push-button scan that is both comfortable for patients and simple for technologists to perform. MR Multitasking redesigns quantitative MRI around the concept of images as functions of many time dimensions, each corresponding to a different dynamic process (e.g., motion, T1, T2, T2*, and diffusion), and then uses mathematical models called low-rank tensors to perform fast, multidimensional imaging. This allows continuous acquisition of imaging data even while the subject is moving, providing motion-resolved parameter maps without breath holding or motion synchronization. We will scan healthy subjects, liver patients, prostate cancer patients, and cardiovascular patients to develop and validate this technology and use artificial intelligence to quickly reconstruct images from the collected data. The resulting tool will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to answer a wide range of biomedical questions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  This project is to develop and validate a one-stop, push-button solution for comprehensive, motion- resolved quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This will be accomplished by cultivating a new technology, MR Multitasking, which can measure multiple tissue biomarkers in a single scan, even in moving organs. The resulting technology will be applicable to any organ system, offering clinicians and investigators a valuable tool to diagnose, monitor, and study a wide range of diseases.","Motion-Resolved, Comprehensive Quantitative Tissue Characterization Using MR Multitasking",10084899,R01EB028146,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Arrhythmia', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Blood flow', 'Breathing', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Edema', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Fibrosis', 'Hemorrhage', 'Image', 'Iron', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Lipids', 'Liver', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetism', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Property', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Respiration', 'Risk Assessment', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Staging', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'body system', 'deep learning', 'heart motion', 'image reconstruction', 'magnetic field', 'magnetohydrodynamic', 'mathematical model', 'multitask', 'new technology', 'prospective', 'quantitative imaging', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'time use', 'tissue biomarkers', 'tool']",NIBIB,CEDARS-SINAI MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,616003
"Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI Summary/Abstract In the presence of diseases such as ischemic heart disease (IHD), cardiac dyssynchrony deteriorates cardiac function and often cannot be treated effectively. However, while imaging methods such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can provide high quality images of the moving heart, conventional clinical quantitative analysis of cardiac function is largely limited to global function analysis of the left ventricle (LV), with only qualitative and subjective characterization of regional function. An obstacle to better quantification of regional function is the complex 3D structure and motion of the heart wall, which has typically necessitated time-consuming user-guided processing of the images to carry out the associated 3D-motion analysis.  Recent advances in machine-learning (ML) approaches for image analysis are promising as new means to speed up the processing of cardiac images, as well as to analyze the underlying regional motion patterns. However, current Deep ML (DML) approaches to image analysis largely function as “black boxes”, without clear indications of which features contribute most to the analysis results, thus limiting their clinical utility. In the initial funded period of this research project, we have been developing integrated approaches to the segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and analysis of CMR data, with application to the evaluation of cardiac dyssynchrony. Today, treatment of dyssynchrony in HF with cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) leads to improvement in only ~2/3 patients selected with conventional criteria (usually by electrocardiogram [ECG]). Our initial results show encouraging results of correlation between MRI evaluation of dyssynchrony and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) outcomes. In the new proposed research, we will further develop these methods, with the goal of automating the cardiac analysis methods. This will include the introduction of new ML-based methods, which will incorporate information on the specific cardiac motion factors that lead to classification of different disease states in dyssynchrony. Our Hypothesis is that by using these new ML-based methods for cardiac motion analysis, we will discover and evaluate significant quantitative correlations between different cardiac dyssynchrony motion patterns and CRT outcomes. Also, late-gadolinium enhancement (LGE) provides images for infarction visualization. Incorporation of tissue characterization into the motion-pattern analysis could lead to increased understanding of how infarcted areas affect regional motion in concert with dyssynchrony. The unearthing of these findings will allow us to validate them in future clinical studies. The project will also disseminate our novel, coupled DML and model-based methodology for quantifying and classifying cardiac motion in diseases affecting regional wall motion. Other research groups can then apply our tools to specifically study dyssynchrony, as well as other cardiac diseases affecting LV motion. Project Narrative A significant proportion of patients with heart failure and cardiac dyssynchrony fail to positively respond to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), as the current clinical selection criteria do not take into account regional cardiac function. We will develop improved methods for 4D-analysis and -visualization of both global and regional cardiac function from cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) data, including novel deep learning methods that will provide additional information on the salient features that contribute most to characterization of cardiac dyssynchrony. These new methods will be applied to the analysis of CMR data from both a stratified sample of normal subjects and patients with cardiac dyssynchrony (with and without infarction), with correlation with therapeutic results following CRT, potentially leading to improved clinical guidelines and clinical outcomes, as well as increased understanding of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology.",Machine Learning and Deformable Model-based 4D Characterization of Cardiac Dyssynchrony from MRI,10234187,R01HL127661,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Automation', 'Cardiac', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Consumption', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'EKG QRS Complex', 'Echocardiography', 'Electrocardiogram', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heart failure', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Infarction', 'Ischemia', 'Lead', 'Left ventricular structure', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Myocardial Ischemia', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patient Selection', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Pump', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Schedule', 'Selection Criteria', 'Speed', 'Sweden', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'Visualization', 'Width', 'base', 'cardiac resynchronization therapy', 'deep learning', 'effective therapy', 'heart function', 'heart imaging', 'heart motion', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'reconstruction', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'success', 'therapy outcome', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NHLBI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R01,2021,735785
"Model Based Deep Learning Framework for Ultra-High Resolution Multi-Contrast MRI Sensitive imaging biomarkers are urgently needed for screening of high‐risk subjects, determine early disease progression, and assess response to therapies in neurodegenerative disorders. The atrophy of several brain regions is an established biomarker in AD, which strongly correlates with AD neuropathology. The accuracy of subfield volumes and cortical thickness estimated from current MRI methods is limited because of the vulnerability to motion, low spatial resolution, low contrast between brain sub‐structures, and dependence of current segmentation frameworks on image quality. Short motion‐compensated MRI protocols to map the human brain at high spatial resolution with multiple contrasts, along with accurate and computationally efficient segmentation algorithms, are urgently needed tor early detection and management of subjects with neurodegenerative disorders. We propose to introduce a 15‐minute motion‐robust 3‐D acquisition and reconstruction scheme to recover whole‐brain MRI data with 0.2 mm isotropic resolution with several different inversion times on 7T, along with segmentation algorithms that are robust to acceleration. The key difference of this framework from current approaches, which rely on MRI data 1 mm resolution, is the quite significant increase in spatial resolution to 0.2 mm as well as the availability of multiple conteasts. This improvement is enabled by innovations in all areas of the data‐processing pipeline, including acquisition, reconstruction, and analysis. These innovations are facilitated and integrated by the model based deep learning framework (MoDL); this framework facilitates the joint exploitation the available prior information, including motion and models for magnetization evolution, with convolutional neural network blocks that learn anatomical information from exemplar data. The successful completion of this framework will yield sensitive biomarkers, which will be considerably less expensive than PET and does not involve radiation exposure. As 7T clinical scanners become more common, this framework can emerge as a screening tool for high‐risk subjects (e.g. APOE, PSEN mutations) and assess progression in patients with short follow‐up duration. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is now a major public health concern with life expectancy at an all-time high. In US alone, the number of affected patients is expected to triple to 13.8 million by the year 2050. This proposal focuses on the development of an ultra-high resolution multicontrast MRI protocol, with the objective of improving the accuracy of brain atrophy rates in early AD subjects. The successful completion of this proposal will yield a biomarker that is sensitive to early brain changes in AD, which can facilitate early detection in high risk population, measure progression, and quantify the efficacy of brain sparing drugs.",Model Based Deep Learning Framework for Ultra-High Resolution Multi-Contrast MRI,10120861,R01AG067078,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Back', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cadaver', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evolution', 'Financial compensation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Joint repair', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Life Expectancy', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Mutation', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Radial', 'Radiation exposure', 'Recovery', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Screening procedure', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive testing', 'convolutional neural network', 'data analysis pipeline', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'direct application', 'entorhinal cortex', 'falls', 'follow-up', 'high risk', 'high risk population', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropathology', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'reconstruction', 'respiratory', 'response', 'screening', 'segmentation algorithm', 'sex', 'ultra high resolution']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R01,2021,727486
"Quantitative MR Imaging of Vascular Factors in Parkinsons Disease Abstract Vascular health has been shown to be an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Hence, the ability to measure reliably and quantitatively early hemodynamic changes in the aging brain can be a powerful tool for diagnosing, studying, and developing treatments. Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) magnetic resonance imaging can yield quantitative perfusion images without the use of contrast agents. We propose that combining new ASL techniques, such as Velocity Selective Inversion (VSI) labeling pulses and magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF) with deep learning regression methods will allow quantification of multiple hemodynamic parameters beyond perfusion, thus providing a much more nuanced picture of the state of the vasculature. We also expect that the new technique will offer dramatic improvements in SNR, specificity and sensitivity of ASL, and that the proposed techniques will have many other applications in research and in the clinic. We propose to use these techniques to fill the knowledge gap regarding the relationship between vascular changes and Parkinson’s disease and its symptoms, particularly fatigue, whose pathogenesis is not well understood. If we are successful in this application, future work will use the hemodynamic parameters of interest as biomarkers to assess risk of neurodegeneration, determine therapeutic targets, and guide in the development of new therapies. Public Health Statement Vascular health is an important factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases We propose to develop a method that can produce quantifiable images of multiple blood flow related parameters with a single scan and without the use of contrast injections.

"Fast Multi-dimensional Diffusion MRI with Sparse Sampling and Model-based Deep Learning Reconstruction Project Summary: Neurodegenerative disorders are a significant public health and economic problem and are the leading cause of disability worldwide. Understanding the specific degenerative processes that are actively progressing over the course of the illness is crucial for developing targeted drugs therapies and deciding treatment options. Additionally, understanding the structural connectivity changes to tease apart the specific circuitry affected is crucial in developing circuit specific non-invasive brain stimulation therapies. Diffusion- based MRI assays can provide microstructural measures that are highly sensitive to (i) the neurodegenerative processes and (ii) connectivity changes. Advanced modeling approaches can be utilized to further enhance the specificity of the microstructural measures to the underlying neurodegenerative processes. However, their utility is often limited to pure white matter regions. At the typical spatial resolution of diffusion MRI (~2mm isotropic voxel size), significant partial volume effects exist in most brain voxels (e.g., voxels with multiple tissue types, heterogenous fibers with different properties). In whole brain studies, this compromises the specificity of the disease processes identified by the advanced modeling approaches; it also contributes to inaccurate connectivity mapping. Additionally, the diffusion parameter encoding space is currently limited to one or two shells of low b-values (b<2000s/mm2), which limits the unique determination of several relevant microstructural parameters. The main objective of the proposal is the development, validation and clinical translation of a diffusion MRI assay that enable efficient encoding of diffusion parameter space at sub- millimeter voxel resolution for joint microstructure and connectivity mapping in the whole brain. Our overall hypothesis is that the proposed framework can significantly improve the validity of microstructural modeling in most brain voxels. The proposed development will make use of SNR-efficient 3D multi-slab acquisitions. Coupled with time-efficient sparse k-q sampling, the encoding will span over multiple b-shells. To allow the unique determination of several relevant microstructural parameters, multicompartmental T2 information will be utilized. The proposed developments will be enabled by two advanced reconstruction methods: structured low- rank matrix completion, a novel integrative framework for MRI reconstructions that enables several capabilities including multi-echo imaging and self-calibrating reconstruction; and model-based deep learning, a novel deep architecture to solve MR reconstruction algorithms using neural networks in a systematic fashion. These methods overcome several inefficiencies associated with extending the 3D multi-slab acquisition for multi- dimensional imaging in the k-q-TE space. To ensure scientific rigor, we will comprehensively validate our technology on dedicated diffusion phantoms along with healthy volunteers using different quantification metrics. We also validate the capability of the dMRI assay using a multi-modal MRI study in a cross-sectional study on a cohort of Huntington's disease.

These interfraction variations are among the major factors that can limit the accuracy of RT targeting. The current standard practice of image-guided RT (IGRT), developed to address the interfraction variations based on cone-beam CT (CBCT), can only correct for translational errors, and thus does not fully account for interfraction changes. To address this issue, researchers recently introduced online adaptive replanning (OLAR) that generates a new plan based on the anatomy of the day and delivers the plan for the fraction. Currently, two main obstacles affect the success of OLAR: (1) the anatomy of the day cannot be delineated accurately based on CBCT, and (2) the time required to perform OLAR is long enough to render it impractical. One way to improve the delineation accuracy is to use MRI versus CT. MRI-guided OLAR is currently being introduced into the clinics to substantially improve RT targeting. However, the bottleneck is still the impractical length of time required to segment the anatomy of the day, which can exceed 30 minutes. Furthermore, available synthetic CT (sCT) generation methods are slow or inaccurate for MRI-guided OLAR. There is no method available to quickly and objective determine when OLAR is necessary. To address these issues, we plan to develop novel techniques in the MOLAR solution. We hypothesize that the MRI-based MOLAR solution will fully account for interfraction changes, thereby substantially improving tumor targeting during RT delivery and the effectiveness of RT. Specifically, we aim to (1) develop practical ML-based solutions to quickly determine the necessity of OLAR and to rapidly generate accurate synthetic CTs; (2) develop ML-based techniques to substantially accelerate segmentation for OLAR using a progressive three-step process; and (3) verify clinical practicality and effectiveness of MOLAR by retrospectively and prospectively applying the MOLAR on MRI sets to test its speed and effectiveness in accounting for interfraction variations. We will develop this novel MOLAR solution by forging unique collaborations between clinical physicists, radiation oncologists and industry developers via an established academic-industry partnership. The successful completion of this project will enable clinicians to routinely practice “image-plan-treat”, which is the optimal solution for MRgRT. This new paradigm will fully account for interfraction variations, improve tumor targeting, reduce normal tissue toxicity, and ultimately encourage clinicians to revise the current doses and/or dose fractionations to increase therapeutic gain, enhance patient quality of life, and/or substantially save on healthcare costs. Our proposed strategy represents a drastic departure from current practice. We firmly believe that this strategy is the future of RT delivery. Project Narrative: This R01 application proposes to develop and test a novel machine learning accelerated online adaptive replanning (MOLAR) solution for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guided adaptive radiation therapy through a unique academic and industry partnership. The MOLAR solution aims to fully account for interfraction variations, thereby substantially improving the accuracy and effectiveness of radiation therapy (RT) for cancer.

"A comprehensive deep learning framework for MRI reconstruction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The primary goal of this investigation is to develop and validate a comprehensive, robust deep learning (DL) framework that improves MRI reconstruction beyond the limits of existing technology. The proposed framework uses “plug-and-play” algorithms to combine physics-driven MR acquisition models with state-of-the-art learned image models, which are instantiated by image denoising subroutines. To fully exploit the rich structure of MR images, we propose to use DL-based denoisers that are trained in an application-speciﬁc manner. The proposed framework, termed PnP-DL, offers advantages over other existing DL methods, as well as compressed sensing (CS). Compared to existing DL methods for MRI reconstruction, PnP-DL is more immune to inevitable variations in the forward model, such as changes in the coil sensitivities or undersampling pattern, allowing it to generalize across applications and acquisition settings. Compared to CS, PnP-DL recovers images faster, with higher quality, and with potentially superior diagnostic value. Our preliminary results highlight the potential of PnP-DL to advance MRI technology. In this work, we will fur- ther develop PnP-DL and validate it in these major applications: cardiac cine, 2D brain, and 3D brain imaging. In Aim 1, we will train and optimize convolutional neural network-based application-speciﬁc denoisers for the above-mentioned applications. The denoiser with the best denoising performance will be selected for further investigation. In Aim 2, we will develop and compare different PnP algorithms. The algorithm yielding the best combination of reconstruction accuracy and computational speed will be implemented in Gadgetron for inline processing. In Aim 3, we will compare the performance of PnP-DL to other state-of-the-art methods using retro- spectively undersampled data. This study will demonstrate that, in terms of image quality, PnP-DL is superior to CS and existing DL methods and, despite higher acceleration, is non-inferior to parallel MRI with rate-2 acceler- ation. In Aim 4, we will evaluate the performance of PnP-DL using prospectively undersampled data from adult and pediatric patients. Successful completion of this project will demonstrate that PnP-DL outperforms state- of-the-art methods in terms of image quality while exhibiting a level of robustness and broad applicability that has eluded other DL-based MRI reconstruction methods. The acceleration and image quality improvement afforded by these developments will beneﬁt almost all MRI applications, including pediatric imaging, where reducing sedation is a pressing need, and high-dimensional imaging applications (e.g., whole-heart 4D ﬂow imaging), which are too slow for routine clinical use. PROJECT NARRATIVE Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has many advantages over other imaging methods, but MRI is slow. Addi- tional developments are required to shorten the scan time, improve patient comfort, reduce the use of sedation for imaging children, and improve image quality. In this project, we will develop faster and more accurate methods for MRI. These efforts should lead to signiﬁcant improvements in the diagnosis of different diseases, so that patients may beneﬁt from appropriate treatment.",A comprehensive deep learning framework for MRI reconstruction,10211757,R01EB029957,"['3-Dimensional', '4D MRI', 'Acceleration', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Architecture', 'Awareness', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cardiac', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Formulation', 'Goals', 'Headache', 'Heart', 'Heart Diseases', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging technology', 'Immune', 'Investigation', 'Lead', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Network-based', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Recovery', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sedation procedure', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'computer framework', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'denoising', 'design', 'heart imaging', 'high dimensionality', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'musculoskeletal imaging', 'neural network architecture', 'novel', 'pediatric patients', 'prospective', 'real-time images', 'reconstruction', 'repository']",NIBIB,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,613825
"Reconstruction of robust, high SNR functional brain images using machine learning and oscillatory steady state MRI Project Summary/Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important tool both clinically and in scientific research, with broad applications ranging from cognitive neuroscience to presurgical planning. FMRI can generate whole brain neuronal activation maps, yet it is an inherently low signal to noise ratio (SNR) method due to the relatively small changes in activation signal relative to the baseline signal. The overarching goal of this project is to develop and validate robust, high SNR fMRI by using a novel acquisition method, oscillating steady state (OSS) fMRI, along with machine learning (ML) techniques, to reconstruct high-quality images of the OSS fMRI data. OSS fMRI can increase SNR by >2x compared to the current state-of-the-art in fMRI acquisition methods, and this boost is roughly equivalent to the SNR gain going from a 3T MRI scanner to a 7T MRI scanner. The SNR increase is a direct result of the steady state approach. However, with a more complex, oscillating acquisition, OSS fMRI can be more susceptible to common MRI artifacts than traditional methods if left uncorrected. Two of the most common sources of MRI artifacts are changes in the main magnetic field (B0) due to physiological noise (such as respiration) and patient motion. This project will develop robust, high SNR fMRI at 3T by incorporating the effects of (1) B0 changes and (2) patient motion into the OSS signal model and image reconstruction algorithms. A new image reconstruction that incorporates neural networks will correct for B0 fluctuations and remove B0 induced artifacts. We will train a neural network to generate B0 field maps using data from a conventional, physics-based two echo field mapping technique to implicitly incorporate prior information of the physics into the reconstruction, while also providing a fast, ML-based field mapping method. To correct for subject motion, we will develop a neural network that estimates rigid-body motion parameters from sequential image frames in the fMRI scan. These motion parameters will be used in an iterative image reconstruction to produce high-quality resting-state and task-based fMRI, even in the presence of subject motion. The technology developed in this proposal will result in improved functional MRI that has the potential to significantly advance both the study of the human brain and the treatment of neurological disorders. The University of Michigan is one of the top research universities in the US, and provides an ideal environment and infrastructure to complete the proposed research strategy. The Functional Magnetic Resonance Laboratory and the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at UM have all the necessary hardware and computational resources needed for this project, including two state-of-the-art GE 3T MRI scanners and extensive GPU hardware for the machine learning components of the project. Furthermore, Drs. Jeffrey Fessler and Douglas Noll have proven expertise in fMRI image acquisition and reconstruction, as well as extensive mentorship experience, that will help guide this project and my training. Project Narrative Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to measure brain function, and it has revolutionized our understanding of cognitive processes during the last 25 years and has also been used as a tool for presurgical mapping of language and other sensitive brain regions. More recently, fMRI is being used as a biomarker for the progression of neurologic and psychiatric diseases, for example, in Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and major depression. In this project we will improve fMRI techniques by developing new methods that are more robust to common sources of MRI image degradation, which will improve the sharpness of the fMRI images without increasing instrumentation costs.","Reconstruction of robust, high SNR functional brain images using machine learning and oscillatory steady state MRI",10196983,F32EB029289,"['Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dictionary', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Head Movements', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging Phantoms', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Infrastructure', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Left', 'Length', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Neurologic Process', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'computer science', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'experience', 'functional MRI scan', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'instrumentation', 'magnetic field', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'novel', 'open source', 'progression marker', 'reconstruction', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,F32,2021,66390
"Quantitative CEST MRI for GBM Early Response Prediction and Biopsy Guidance ABSTRACT  Despite advances in therapy, the most aggressive form of brain tumor, glioblastoma, remains almost universally fatal. The first-line therapy for this devastating cancer is maximum feasible surgical resection, followed by radiotherapy with concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy (CRT). It is encouraging that there are multiple second-line therapies in clinical trials that could improve life quality or prolong survival, such as anti- angiogenic therapy (AAT). In this scenario, the accurate determination of whether a patient is a responder or a non-responder at an early stage following CRT has become a significant factor in clinical practice. However, the limitations in neuroimaging complicate the clinical management of patients and impede efficient testing of new therapeutics. Even with the improvements in advanced imaging modalities, distinguishing true progression vs. pseudoprogression (induced by CRT), or response vs. pseudoresponse (induced by AAT) remain two of the most formidable diagnostic dilemmas. Hence, the current gold standard for diagnosis and local therapy planning is still based on pathologic appraisal of tissue samples. However, even this yields variable results due to the intra-tumoral heterogeneity of treatment response. Therefore, reliable imaging tools, capable of early prediction of the tumor response to clinical therapies, are urgently needed. Amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) imaging is a chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)-based molecular MRI technique, which has been demonstrated to add important value to the clinical MRI assessment in neuro-oncology. However, most currently used imaging protocols are essentially semi-quantitative, and the images obtained are often called APTw images because of other contributions. Notably, it has been shown that quantitative CEST-MRI is able to achieve more pure and higher APT signals in patients with brain tumors. On the other hand, deep- learning is a state-of-the-art imaging analysis technique that provides exciting solutions with minimum human input. In particular, the saliency maps derived act as a localizer for class-discriminative regions, and may have great potential to guide biopsies and local treatment regimens. The goals of this proposal are to demonstrate the potential of quantitative CEST-MRI to resolve two formidable diagnostic dilemmas for GBM patients and to develop an automated deep-learning framework for post-treatment surveillance and biopsy guidance. This application has three specific aims: (1) Implement and optimize the quantitative CEST-MRI technique and quantify its accuracy in predicting early response to CRT and survival; (2) Determine the capability of quantitative CEST-MRI to assess the response to bevacizumab; and (3) Develop a deep-learning pipeline that includes structural and CEST images for responsiveness differentiation and stereotactic biopsy guidance. If successful, our results—and particularly the deep-learning platform established—will be readily available to accurately identify early response and guide stereotactic biopsy, thus changing the clinical pathway. Distinguishing recurrent tumor from treatment effect following therapy remains a major clinical challenge in neuro-oncology. We will assess the potential of quantitative CEST imaging methodologies and develop an automated, deep-learning framework for post-treatment surveillance and biopsy guidance. If successful, the implications for the clinical management of patients with brain tumors and for the robust evaluation of the efficacy of experimental therapeutics are enormous.",Quantitative CEST MRI for GBM Early Response Prediction and Biopsy Guidance,10118591,R37CA248077,"['Adult', 'Aftercare', 'Amides', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Pathways', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Excision', 'FDA approved', 'Glioblastoma', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Local Therapy', 'Localized Malignant Neoplasm', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Glioma', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Output', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Proteins', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Recurrent tumor', 'Repeat Surgery', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Sample', 'Treatment Protocols', 'base', 'bevacizumab', 'chemotherapy', 'clinical practice', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'diagnosis standard', 'efficacy evaluation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'neuro-oncology', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel therapeutics', 'predicting response', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'recruit', 'response', 'temozolomide', 'treatment effect', 'treatment planning', 'treatment response', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R37,2021,382996
"Pooled analysis of multiple sclerosis findings on multi-site 7 Tesla MRI Project Summary/Abstract Background: Although current MRI performs well as a tool to measure white matter (WM) inflammation in MS, its ability to quantify gray matter (GM) pathology, meningeal inflammation, and chronic inflammatory changes are limited. For this reason, researchers have looked to 7-tesla (7T) MRI for more robust in vivo measures of pathology. Although the increased sensitivity of 7T MRI for these aspects of MS have stimulated much interest, the impact of previous studies have been limited due to small sample sizes, varying methodologies, cumbersome analysis methods, and conflicting results – all of which have limited the generalizability of findings and more widespread dissemination of the use of this tool. Objective: In this study, we aim to advance the use of 7T MRI as a tool for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment effect monitoring by performing multi-site, large sample size evaluation of imaging correlates of cortical and deep GM lesions, chronic active WM lesions (WM lesions with paramagnetic rims on MRI), and meningeal inflammation (leptomeningeal inflammation (LME) on MRI) and validation of their clinical relevance. We also will look develop automated tools for identification and quantification of these findings on 7T MRI. Study Design: Imaging and clinical data will be derived from previous and ongoing studies of the use of 7T MRI in MS performed at multiple collaborative sites under the umbrella of the North American Imaging in MS (NAIMS) Collaborative, including the University of Maryland, Baltimore, Harvard-Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Montreal Neurological Institute at McGill University. This includes data on up to 814 individual persons with MS, 1232 individual study visits, and a follow up period of up to 5 years. GM lesions, WM lesions with paramagnetic rims, and LME will be identified on 7T, with critical evaluation of methods and their relationship to clinical data. Further, the manual analysis results will be used as training sets for deep learning algorithms for identification of these abnormalities on future 7T MRI scans. Impact: This study would provide the data on measurement variability and generalizable clinical importance of the imaging findings being investigated, along with providing automated tools for future, high-throughput studies. In advancing these precise measures of aspects of MS pathology only poorly measured on lower field MRI, this study will lead to more accurate MS diagnoses, improvements in the ability to monitor changes in MS pathology over time, and perhaps lead to the screening of new pharmaceutical interventions to target GM lesions, WM lesions with paramagnetic rims, and LME. Project Narrative In this study, multiple institutions performing research using 7-tesla (7T) MRI research on patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) will combine data for a large scale, pooled analysis project. The investigators will refine methods for visualizing cortical and deep gray matter lesions, chronically inflamed white matter lesions, and meningeal inflammation on 7T MRI in MS and will evaluate their clinical relevance on a large scale and develop machine learning algorithms for future identification. It is expected that validating findings on 7T and their clinical relevance along with providing automated tools for analysis will lead to the use of 7T MRI as a more widespread clinical tool, resulting in earlier diagnoses, better prognostication, and more effective treatment monitoring in MS.",Pooled analysis of multiple sclerosis findings on multi-site 7 Tesla MRI,10278178,R01NS122980,"['Algorithmic Analysis', 'American', 'Autopsy', 'Baltimore', 'Biological Markers', 'Caring', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Pooling', 'Demyelinations', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Maryland', 'Masks', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meningeal', 'Meninges', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Multiple Sclerosis Lesions', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Pennsylvania', 'Persons', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Predisposition', 'Protocols documentation', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visit', 'Visualization', 'Woman', 'accurate diagnosis', 'clinical care', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive disability', 'comparative', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'effective therapy', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'high throughput analysis', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'magnetic field', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'outcome forecast', 'physically handicapped', 'prognostic', 'prognostic tool', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment effect', 'white matter']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R01,2021,535821
"Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an invaluable tool for studying the early development of the brain and can resolve diagnostic ambiguities that may remain after routine ultrasound exams. Unfortunately, high levels of fetal and maternal motion (1) limit fetal MRI to rapid two-dimensional (2D) sequences and frequently introduce dramatic artifacts such as (2) image misorientation relative to the standard sagittal, coronal, axial planes needed for clinical assessment and (3) partial to complete signal loss. These factors lead to the inefficient practice of repeating ~30 s stack-of-slices acquisitions until motion-free images have been obtained. Throughout the session, technologists manually adjust the orientation of scans in response to motion, and about 38% of datasets are typically discarded. Thus, subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of MRI for answering clinical and investigational questions in the fetus. The overarching goal of this project is to overcome the challenges posed by motion by exploiting innovations in deep learning, which have enabled image-analysis algorithms with unprecedented speed and reliability. We propose to integrate these into the MRI acquisition pipeline to unlock the potential of fetal MRI. We will develop practical pulse-sequence technology for automated and dynamically motion-corrected fetal neuroimaging without the need for external hardware or calibration. We hypothesize that this will radically improve the quality and success rates of clinical and research studies, while dramatically reducing patient discomfort and cost. We propose as Aim 1 to eradicate (2) the vulnerability of acquisitions to image-brain misorientation with rapid, automated prescription of standard anatomical planes. In Aim 2, we propose to address (3) motion during the scan with real-time correction of fetal-head motion. An anatomical stack-of-slices acquisition will be interleaved with volumetric navigators. These will be used to measure motion as it happens in the scanner and to adaptively update the slice tilt/position. We propose as Aim 3 to develop a 3D radial sequence and estimate motion between subsets of radial spokes for real-time self-navigation. Adaptively updating the orientation of spokes and selectively re-acquiring corrupted subsets at the end of the scan will enable 3D imaging of the fetal brain (1). Since the applicant has a physics background, the proposed training program at MIT and HMS will focus on deep learning and fetal development/neuroscience during the K99 phase to develop the skills needed for transitioning to independence in the R00 phase. The applicant’s goal is to become a fetal image acquisition and analysis scientist acting as bridge between deep learning, MRI and clinical fetal-imaging applications to shift the boundaries of what is currently possible with state-of-the-art technology. Fulfilling the research aims will promote this, as it will result in a practical framework for automation and motion correction, applicable to a wide variety of fetal neuroimaging sequences. PROJECT NARRATIVE Subject motion is the fundamental impediment to reaping the full benefits of fetal-brain magnetic resonance imaging, as it frequently produces images with dramatic artifacts. The goal of this project is to exploit innovations in deep learning and integrate them into the acquisition pipeline to overcome the challenges posed by motion in fetal neuroimaging studies. This will be achieved by using fast, automated scan prescription of standard anatomical planes and by adaptively updating the acquisition as motion happens in the scanner, based on sub-second navigator scans interleaved with the imaging sequence.",Fast motion-robust fetal neuroimaging with MRI,10197182,K99HD101553,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Amniotic Fluid', 'Anatomy', 'Automation', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Calibration', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical assessments', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Fetal Development', 'Fetus', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Head', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Masks', 'Measures', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Radial', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Residual state', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical investigation', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'echo detection', 'experience', 'fetal', 'image archival system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'prospective', 'radiologist', 'reconstruction', 'repaired', 'research study', 'response', 'skills', 'success', 'tool', 'two-dimensional']",NICHD,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K99,2021,109671
"MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers SUMMARY The importance of biomarkers in clinical practice and regulatory science is difficult to overstate. The ultimate goal for clinical care of the future is to determine the most appropriate therapy for each patient’s unique version of a particular disease. This concept of precision medicine has been identified as a national priority in the USA, leading to a need for biomarkers that can provide objective and reproducible information. In addition, regulatory science for the approval of new qualified drugs and medical technologies has an urgent need for qualified biomarkers to report on the success or failure of these drugs and technologies. Imaging biomarkers, providing in situ “biopsies”, have the potential to provide such specific information and, ultimately, to improve routine clinical care and speed up development of new treatments. The overall goal of this Resource therefore is to develop novel noninvasive MRI candidate biomarkers that can ultimately be used for: (i) personalized assessment of patients for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment monitoring; (ii) monitoring of the development of new medical technologies and drugs, i.e. for better guiding of clinical trials. The significance of our proposed developments lies in providing the fundamental design and initial testing (i.e. not clinical trials itself) of new MRI candidate biomarkers with the potential to provide surrogate quantitative imaging endpoints that are as close as possible to clinical endpoints. As such, this Resource will focus on designing, calibrating and standardizing new magnetic resonance (MR) technologies to provide reliable measures across sessions, scanners, and raters. This technology will then be disseminated for larger scale patient studies to allow clinical validation.  The MRI Resource for Physiologic, Metabolic and Anatomic Biomarkers is an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary consortium combining facilities and expertise of the F.M. Kirby Research Center at Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI), the Department of Radiology at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) School of Medicine, the Center for Imaging Science at the JHU Whiting School of Engineering, and the Department of Biostatistics at the JHU Bloomberg School of Public Health. We propose 4 TRD projects, 3 on MR acquisition approaches and one bringing them together with advanced multi-scale data analysis methods that include machine learning. To assure a proper choice of technologies, we will interact closely with a group of clinical and research experts in a push-pull relationship through collaborative projects (CPs) that focus on brain diseases, disorders, and injuries that have a need for new quantitative MR technology to better and noninvasively assess them. These include anemia/ischemia and related white matter hyperintensity lesions (CPs 1,5), aging, cerebrovascular disease, and dementia (CPs 2,7,10), traumatic brain injury (CP4), glymphatic function (CP6), pain (CP8) and addiction (CP9). As an initial testbed for our methods, we also have a group of service projects (SPs) to which we will provide both data acquisition methods and data analysis software. Finally, we will train investigators in their use and disseminate methods nationwide and to MRI manufacturers for even broader application.

"Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn’s Disease Project Summary: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that has a prevalence of over 800,000 in the US alone. The economic impact is disproportionally high because it affects primarily young individuals. The characteristic periods of remission and relapse necessitate frequent hospitalizations. There has been a recent shift in clinical practice from a reactive to a proactive CD treatment strategy, recently coined as “treat-to-target”, where patients are treated to achieve not only an initial response-to-therapy, but also longer clinical remissions and improved mucosal healing. However, this approach requires the regular assessment of disease activity using objective markers enabling treatments to be tailored to the individual patient. Therefore, there is an unmet need for new tools to improve diagnostic accuracy, to quantify disease burden, and to monitor treatment efficacy. Our application in response to PAR-19-056, “Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn's disease” is aimed at developing and evaluating noninvasive, contrast and radiation-free quantitative imaging markers for assessing disease activity and for monitoring response to therapy. Currently available non-contrast MR imaging (MRI) sequences such as diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) and the calculated apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps are attractive but limited in providing robust and reproducible markers. Different imaging protocols or different scanners result in different ADC values. Our primary goal is to develop robust and reliable quantitative DW-MR imaging markers for the non-contrast and non-invasive assessment of CD. The proposed novel MRI acquisition and model fitting techniques will provide measurements of slow and fast diffusion as well as fraction of fast diffusion, as highly accurate, quantitative biomarkers for cell proliferation, density and size, and tissue perfusion—all indices that characterize the extent of disease activity (i.e., inflammation) in the tissue micro-structure of the bowel. To achieve this goal, we will first develop and implement an advanced distortion and motion corrected (DiMoCo) DW-MRI technique and a spatially constrained probabilistic intravoxel incoherent motion (SPIM) model to compute robust and reproducible markers. Next, we will reduce the imaging time with estimated x4 acceleration with an accelerated image acquisition and a new, advanced deep learning-based parameter estimation technique. The proposed imaging techniques and software tools will provide robust quantitative markers, thereby enabling the accurate assessment of CD activity and response to therapy. They will also reduce the need for invasive endoscopy procedures as well as the total number of other tests typically ordered for monitoring disease, effectively reducing both the disease burden and the overall cost of healthcare. Another important goal is to develop and broadly disseminate open source software that will enable the standardized evaluation of other diseases presently evaluated with DW-MRI that would benefit from the advanced diagnostic and assessment capabilities of the proposed DiMoCo SPIM-DW-MRI technique. Project Narrative: Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract that impacts over 800,000 patients in the US alone, where characteristic periods of remission and relapse necessitate frequent, costly hospitalizations and symptoms such as bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, general malaise, and fever significantly compromise quality of life. There is a need for new tools aimed at the reliable assessment of disease activity by using objective markers to improve diagnostic accuracy, quantify disease burden, and monitor treatment efficacy, enabling subsequent treatments tailored to the individual patient's disease profile. The primary objective of this project is three-fold: First, to develop and validate a novel, noninvasive, contrast- and radiation-free quantitative MR imaging and image analysis technique, i.e., DiMoCo-SPIM that will generate robust and reproducible imaging markers from DW-MRI that will enable clinicians to more accurately assess bowel inflammation and response to therapy; second, to develop a machine learning technique that reduces the imaging time (x4 acceleration); and third, to make image analysis software developed in this proposal available in multiple clinical domains that presently evaluate various diseases with MRI and would benefit from the improved diagnostic and assessment capabilities of this computationally-driven technique.",Robust quantitative MR imaging markers of response to therapy in Crohn’s Disease,10121764,R01DK125561,"['Abdominal Pain', 'Acceleration', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Markers', 'Coin', 'Computer software', 'Contrast Media', 'Crohn&apos', 's disease', 'Deposition', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease remission', 'Endoscopy', 'Estimation Techniques', 'Evaluation', 'Fever', 'Gadolinium', 'Goals', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hemorrhagic colitis', 'Hospital Costs', 'Hospitalization', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunomodulators', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Intestines', 'Ionizing radiation', 'Laboratory Markers', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malaise', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Mucous Membrane', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Patient Outcomes Assessments', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Relapse', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Respiration', 'Safety', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell motility', 'chronic inflammatory disease', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinical practice', 'clinical remission', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'density', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'diffusion weighted', 'economic impact', 'efficacy evaluation', 'healing', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'indexing', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'open source', 'quantitative imaging', 'response', 'response biomarker', 'soft tissue', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'water diffusion']",NIDDK,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2021,391320
"Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI Project Summary Osteoarthritis (OA) is an enormous clinical problem and worldwide cause of disability. Development of new therapies for OA is hampered by a lack of sensitive imaging tests that respond to changes in disease status. Recently FDA and CE approved clinical knee 7T MRI has the potential to add sensitivity and specificity to advanced MRI biomarkers of OA progression. This project will compare changes seen at 3T and 7T across two different vendors systems and assess the potential for 7T MRI to improve our ability to study and develop new disease- modifying therapies. This study will enhance future studies and clinical exams at 7T and can be used to improve routine 3T MRI though machine learning reconstruction and enhanced understanding of OA disease mechanisms. Understanding the relative strengths of 3T and 7T MRI in this important clinical application is critical to developing new disease-modifying treatments for patients with OA. Narrative Osteoarthritis affects more than half of the population during their lives and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Diagnostic imaging of osteoarthritis is often limited to x-ray, but more sensitive and specific imaging is a critical need for development of disease-modifying treatments. This work aims to develop novel 3D imaging approaches using 3T and 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to quantitatively assess joint health across different tissues in osteoarthritis.",Osteoarthritis: Quantitative Evaluation of Whole Joint Disease with MRI,10190939,R01EB002524,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Biochemical', 'Biomechanics', 'Cartilage', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Degenerative polyarthritis', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Funding', 'Future', 'GAG Gene', 'Health', 'Human', 'Hydroxyl Radical', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Joints', 'Knee', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Meniscus structure of joint', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Morphology', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Orthopedics', 'Patients', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Population', 'Proteoglycan', 'Quality of life', 'Quantitative Evaluations', 'Replacement Arthroplasty', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'arthropathies', 'clinical application', 'clinical examination', 'clinical imaging', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'design', 'disability', 'efficacy evaluation', 'efficacy trial', 'imaging approach', 'imaging detection', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'innovation', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'mechanical properties', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient population', 'quantitative imaging', 'rapid technique', 'reconstruction', 'soft tissue', 'tool', 'treatment strategy']",NIBIB,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,611185
"Imaging and Analysis Techniques to Construct a Cell Census Atlas of the Human Brain Admin Supplement Abstract The ~86 billion neurons that form the human brain are organized at multiple scales, ranging from the fine details of an individual neuron’s dendritic arborization, to local circuits that are embedded within large-scale systems spanning the brain. In this project, we will image across this vast range of scales to create a multiscale atlas akin to Google Earth for the human brain that can visualize hemisphere-wide networks and then zoom in to see individual, labeled cells at micron resolution in the frontal temporal lobe. This dramatic advance will be made possible through the use of an array of imaging technologies, including light-sheet microscopy (LSM), tissue clearing, immunohistochemistry (IMH), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and newly developed techniques in Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). OCT in particular is a potentially transformative technology as it provides micron resolution over large volumes of tissue, images all of the tissue (as opposed to fluorescence), does not require mounting and staining and hence can be automated, and is essentially distortion free as it images the tissue prior to cutting. LSM-based IMH will provide molecular, morphological and spatial properties of cells that will enable us to develop cellular classification systems, while OCT images of the same tissue will enable us to remove the distortions induced by cutting and clearing, and transfer information to whole-hemisphere MRI for atlasing and in vivo inference. This transfer of information depends critically on the ability to register images across a huge range of resolutions and contrast types. For this we propose to use the endogenous fiducial landmarks provided by the cerebral vasculature. To take full advantage of the vasculature using deep learning requires a training set of labeled vessels in each of our imaging modalities across an array of examples. The goal of this supplement is to provide these labelings including the assessment of intra- and inter-rater reliability. Relevance Automated segmentation of neurons, glia, cortical areas and laminar boundaries will enable new and more specific types of analyses of neuroimaging data. In particular, the ability to probe cellular and laminar properties of specific cortical areas may provide significant advances in developmental disorders such as Alzheimer’s, autism, schizophrenia and dyslexia. To facilitate these advances we propose to label cerebral vessels, then use the manual labeling to develop a deep learning-based technique to register images from microscopy to whole-hemisphere MRI.",Imaging and Analysis Techniques to Construct a Cell Census Atlas of the Human Brain Admin Supplement,10307352,U01MH117023,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Cerebrovascular system', 'Cerebrum', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Dyslexia', 'Fluorescence', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Light', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manuals', 'Microscopy', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Planet Earth', 'Property', 'Resolution', 'Schizophrenia', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'deep learning', 'developmental disease', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'microscopic imaging', 'neuroimaging']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,U01,2021,99916
"Multi-Site Clinical Data to Power MRI Biomarker of Neonatal Brain Injury Abstract This project aims to release our recently gathered existing clinically-acquired data for neonatal hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). HIE affects 1-5/1000 term-born neonates and is a major cause of early-childhood mortality and morbidity. Neonatal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is acquired routinely for the clinical care of HIE. Neonatal brain MRI is expected to reveal 3D neuroanatomic mechanisms of adverse outcomes so that we can design new treatments specifically target those mechanisms. Neonatal brain MRI also carries hope to identify those neonates who are at risk to develop adverse outcomes later in life, so that early intervention program can target those at-risk neonates for maximum benefit. Despite MRI's vital role in caring for HIE, the current norm in clinical practice is to read MRI visually by expert neuroradiologist or neurologist. Expert reads, however, has many limitations – subjective, qualitative, insufficient to reveal mechanisms, and inadequate to predict outcomes. Objective and quantitative analysis of MRI is possible with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) in medical and neuroimaging informatics. A major limitation, however, is the lack of publicly-available data on HIE. Our project aims to fill this gap, by archiving and releasing our clinically-acquired, large-scale (N=231), and multi-site (2 hospitals) data on HIE. Our data was acquired partly funded by NIH R01 (2012-2017) and foundations (2016-2020). Our data is comprehensive, including clinical data elements (from both mothers and neonates), neonatal brain MRI (structural and diffusion sequences), expert-consensus annotation of lesion regions in neonatal brain MRI, NICU outcome (death/survival, length of stay), and 2-year-old neurocognitive outcomes (normal/adverse, yes/no for development dealy, yes/no for the hearing/visual/motor impairment, and yes/no for cerebral palsy). Our data is also representative, coming from patients with different racial/ethnicity groups, in patients with a wide range of outcomes, from different MRI scanners (Siemens 3T or GE 1.5T), with different imaging protocols, and MRI scanned on different days of life. We will also derive new data from existing data. The anonymized (de-identified) data will be released to the NCBI dbGaP platform with the “Controlled Access” option, requiring IRB and data use agreement (DUA). The derived data will be released to dbGaP with the “Open Access” option, freely downloadable without any approval. Both release options are consistent with other clinical and MRI data that have already been released on dbGaP. We hope this first comprehensive data will boost future collaborative efforts for AI to automatically identify HIE lesions in MRI, and for AI to accurately predict HIE outcome integrating clinical and MRI information. Project Narrative We aim to publicly release our existing clinically-acquired data for neonatal brain injury caused by hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Our data were retrospectively collected partially funded by NIH R01 (2012-2017) and two other foundational/institutional grant (2016-2020); our data is comprehensive (clinical data from mothers and neonates, neonatal brain MRI with expert-consensus annotations of HIE lesions, and complete set of outcome measures by 2 years of age); our data is representative (MRI scanner, age at MRI, MRI protocol, patient outcomes, patient racial/ethnicity groups); and our data is multi-site (2 hospitals) and large-scale (N=231 compared to proprietary studies with dozens of patients). We plan to use this first public clinical and brain MRI data for HIE to boost artificial intelligence (AI) research for HIE lesion detection and outcome prediction, toward promoting outcomes in this vulnerable neonatal population.",Multi-Site Clinical Data to Power MRI Biomarker of Neonatal Brain Injury,10194889,R03HD104891,"['2 year old', '3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Agreement', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Archives', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Atlases', 'Authorization documentation', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Caring', 'Cerebral Palsy', 'Cessation of life', 'Child Health', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collection', 'Consensus', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Ethnic group', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Hearing', 'Hospitals', 'Human Development', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Length of Stay', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metadata', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Brain Injury', 'Neonatal Intensive Care Units', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Neurologist', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Protocols documentation', 'Race', 'Reader', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study of magnetics', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Treatment outcome', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'cohort', 'cranium', 'data access', 'data de-identification', 'database of Genotypes and Phenotypes', 'design', 'early childhood', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intervention program', 'magnetic resonance imaging biomarker', 'meetings', 'mortality', 'motor impairment', 'natural hypothermia', 'neonatal brain', 'neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury', 'neonatal outcome', 'neonate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'patient registry', 'response', 'sex', 'success', 'symposium', 'targeted treatment', 'visual motor']",NICHD,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2021,94911
