"Inverted Spectroscopic Infrared Microscope (ISIM) for High Throughput Multi-Dimensional Cell Assays Abstract The goal of this research is to develop a novel spectroscopic cellular assay that will enable us to measure the real-time intra-cellular response of a cell to various extra-cellular stimuli. The uniqueness of our approach relies on several innovations. We will construct an Inverted Spectral Infrared Microscope (ISIM) based on Fourier- transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and combining it with a novel biosensor based on plasmonic nanostructures (metasurfaces). The biosensor will be integrated with multi-well plates to enable high- throughput. The proposed assay will detect biochemical and morphological changes of the cell, with the emphasis on the reorganization of the cellular membrane and its cytoskeleton. The multi-dimensional nature of the spectroscopic data will enable the application of machine learning techniques and improve its sensitivity in comparison with traditional one-dimensional real-time assays. To our knowledge, this will be the first real-time cellular assay that satisfies all of the four requirements below: (i) high throughput, (ii) multi-dimensionality of the collected time-dependent data, (iii) specific focus on biochemical changes of the cell, and (iv) focus on the changes occurring in close proximity of the cellular membrane. The assay will be validated using very common external stimuli of the cell, such as small-molecule compounds acting on G-protein coupled receptors. Relevance Statement: The goal of our program is to develop a novel multi-dimensional real-time cell assay. This will be accomplished by constructing an FTIR-based inverted spectral infrared microscope (ISIM) and combining it with a novel biosensor. The biosensor is based on the integration of plasmonic metasurface fabricated on an infrared-transparent glass with multi-well microtiter plates. The proposed geometry will enable high throughput while the metasurface will dramatically enhance the signal-to-noise ratio and reduce the penetration depth of the infrared light into the cell. These innovations will enable us to quantify the effects of extra-cellular signaling on the excitation of intra-cellular signaling pathways. The multi-dimensional nature of the spectroscopic data will enable the application of machine learning techniques and improve the sensitivity in comparison with traditional one-dimensional real-time assays.",Inverted Spectroscopic Infrared Microscope (ISIM) for High Throughput Multi-Dimensional Cell Assays,10218929,R21GM138947,"['Adherence', 'Adhesions', 'Agonist', 'Apoptosis', 'Bar Codes', 'Benchmarking', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Testing', 'Biosensor', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell-Matrix Junction', 'Cells', 'Cellular Assay', 'Cellular Membrane', 'Cessation of life', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Concentration measurement', 'Coupled', 'Cyclic AMP', 'Cytoskeletal Modeling', 'Cytoskeleton', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Dopamine', 'Ensure', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Fingerprint', 'Focal Adhesions', 'Fourier Transform', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Geometry', 'Glass', 'Go Alpha Subunit', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Image', 'Label', 'Lasers', 'Lateral', 'Ligands', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Membrane', 'Microscope', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nanostructures', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Pathologic', 'Penetration', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacologic Substance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Radiation', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Stimulus', 'Surface Plasmon Resonance', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Trypsin', 'Validation', 'Visible Radiation', 'Water', 'absorption', 'base', 'biological systems', 'data standards', 'design', 'detector', 'electric impedance', 'extracellular', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'light transmission', 'novel', 'plasmonics', 'programs', 'receptor', 'response', 'sensor', 'small molecule', 'spectroscopic data', 'temporal measurement', 'tomography', 'tool', 'vibration']",NIGMS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R21,2021,233752
"Regulation of Cellular Proliferation by Novel Mitochondrial-Encoded Tumor Suppressors ABSTRACT Cellular compartments are coordinated through a dynamic bidirectional communication network amongst various organelles. Here, we focus on the communication between mitochondria and the nucleus, organelles that each possess their own genomes. The mitochondrial and nuclear genomes have co-evolved for over a billion years and have likely required close communication and cross-regulation. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by over 1,000 nuclear-encoded proteins, but there is currently no known mitochondrial-encoded factor that actively communicates to and regulates the nucleus. We have recently identified a novel gene encoded within the mitochondrial DNA and named it MOTS-c (Mitochondrial ORF within the Twelve S rRNA type-c). MOTS-c is a small 16 amino acid peptide that regulates metabolic homeostasis, in part, via the master nutrient sensor AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase). We recently reported that MOTS-c can translocate into the nucleus in response to metabolic stress to bind to chromatin and regulate nuclear gene expression. Further, our preliminary study using a multi-pronged approach, including single cell RNA-seq, bioinformatics (including machine learning), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with quantitative PCR (qPCR), and cell sorting, showed that MOTS-c can regulate cellular proliferation; MOTS-c targeted the p53/p21 pathway and ribosomal processes. Considering the important metabolic role of mitochondria in cellular proliferation processes (29), a critical question that remains largely enigmatic is how mitochondrial-encoded factors communicate to the nucleus to coordinate the metabolic shift with gene expression during proliferation. Notably, rapidly dividing cancer cells had undetectable levels of MOTS-c or nuclear-translocation deficiency, suggesting loss of mito-nuclear communication by MOTS-c. Together, cancer may be a genetic disease in which our two genomes exist in a state of disrupted bi-directional communication/regulation, and may serve as a unique model to start understanding the role of MOTS-c in cellular proliferation. Because MOTS-c expression/function was dysregulated and that MOTS-c can negatively regulate cell cycle/proliferation, we hypothesize that MOTS-c is a mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressor, the first of its kind to be identified, that directly regulates the nucleus to coordinate cellular metabolism with proliferation. We propose three aims to test this hypothesis. First, we will characterize MOTS-c as a tumor suppressor that regulates cell proliferation at the molecular, cellular, genetic level. Second, we will comprehensively map the MOTS-c-dependent functional nuclear genomic landscape using multiple complimentary genomics approach, including single cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility), and genomic footprinting using ChIP-seq. The data from each genomic approach will be integrated using cutting-edge computational methods, including machine learning, to decipher the message(s) MOTS- c delivers to the nuclear genome to regulate cancer cell proliferation and survival. Lastly, we will determine how MOTS- c-mediated communication to the nucleus can differentially regulate cellular proliferation and stress resistance in normal and malignant cells using mouse models of cancer. If successful, we predict that our study will have broad and lasting impact on (i) basic research by introducing the paradigm-shifting concept of mitochondrial-encoded tumor suppressors that coordinate cellular metabolism and proliferation and (ii) therapeutic development by revealing mtDNA as a source of novel drug targets (currently there are no FDA-approved drugs based on the mitochondrial genome). PROJECT NARRATIVE Key cellular functions, such as proliferation, require the coordination of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes through dynamic bi-directional communication. However, whereas mitochondria are known to be regulated by many nuclear-encoded proteins, the nucleus has traditionally been not considered to be actively regulated by mitochondrial-encoded factors.

"SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A  PROJECT SUMMARY  What if healthcare providers were equipped with biocompatible, biodegradable, robust, and affordable treatment options that combine therapeutic modalities with controlled mechanisms of action? What if this versatile technology had learning capacity and could be educated to recognize patient-specific diseases and interfere with their progression by redirecting fundamental cellular processes? What if the very same formulation could offer an additional means of control over patients’ immune responses and further advance favorable therapeutic outcomes with minimal toxicities? These next generation therapies would then become a game changer in helping to prevent, detect, diagnose, and treat diseases and disabilities at their source. With the support from MIRA (R35) funding, we envision a data-driven platform, SMART NANPs (specific, modular, adjustable, reproducible, and targeted nucleic acid nanoparticles), encoded by self-assembling nucleic acids. By controlling the flow of genetic information across all forms of life, nucleic acids have become instrumental in acquiring new knowledge about major cellular processes and origins of diseases. Besides their diverse biological roles, these biopolymers can be programmed into NANPs with specified physicochemical properties and functionalities that dictate NANPs’ biological actions with endless possibilities for reprogramming cellular behavior through molecular signaling. We recently discovered that different architectural parameters and compositions of NANPs, delivered to primary human immune cells, can activate monocytes and dendritic cells to produce type I and type III interferons. This pioneering work on NANPs’ immunorecognition highlighted an unforeseen clinical application for this technology in the field of vaccines and immunotherapy. A defined structure-function relationship for any given NANP would then allow conditional actuation of its immunorecognition or any other therapeutic activity through a set of embedded architectural codes. With this notion, we introduced two orthogonal concepts of therapeutic NANPs which can be conditionally activated in human cancer cells to release pre-programmed therapeutics. By uniting these breakthroughs and other preliminary findings from my lab, as highlighted in the current application, and integrating them into a unified network of SMART NANPs with programmable control of biodistribution, immunological activity, and therapeutic modules, we will advance the current repertoire of therapies against infectious diseases and cancers (through NANP-based vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation by thrombin-targeting NANPs), and address drug overdose and safety issues (through the biodegradable nature of NANPs and their controlled deactivation). To maximize the successful translation of this technology, the proposed program will employ a multidisciplinary approach that spans the fields of nucleic acid nanotechnology, immunology, drug delivery, translational oncology, and machine learning. The long-term goal of this program is to elevate SMART NANPs to the level of clinical use. Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Afonin, Kirill, A PROJECT NARRATIVE  Beyond their traditionally known roles as carriers and regulators of genetic information, nucleic acids have auspiciously emerged as versatile therapies for taking advantage of cellular pathways to drive the sensing, targeting, and silencing of a variety of diseases. With MIRA support, we will explore additional nanotechnology- based therapeutic options that enlist a biocompatible nucleic acid-encoded platform (SMART NANPs) for the controlled immunostimulation and modulation of therapeutic responses. This research program aims to advance the envisioned technology towards personalized medicine and aid in addressing top public health challenges in the U.S. as they relate to cancer (through vaccines and immunotherapies), cardiovascular diseases (through regulated coagulation), and drug overdose and safety (through the biodegradable nature of the platform and its functional regulation).",SMART NANPs: new molecular platform for communication with human immune system and modulation of therapeutic responses,10086567,R35GM139587,"['Address', 'Architecture', 'Biodistribution', 'Biological', 'Biopolymers', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Coagulation Process', 'Code', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Formulation', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Health Personnel', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immune system', 'Immunization', 'Immunologics', 'Immunology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interferons', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nanotechnology', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Oncology', 'Overdose', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Principal Investigator', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Role', 'Safety', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thrombin', 'Toxic effect', 'Translations', 'Vaccines', 'Work', 'base', 'biomaterial compatibility', 'cancer cell', 'cell behavior', 'clinical application', 'disability', 'genetic information', 'immunoregulation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'monocyte', 'nanoparticle', 'next generation', 'personalized medicine', 'prevent', 'programs', 'therapy outcome', 'treatment response']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA CHARLOTTE,R35,2021,141556
"A knowledge graph framework for automated gating analysis of cytometry data Project Summary / Abstract Flow and mass cytometry provide multiparametric single-cell data critical for understanding the cellular heterogeneity in various biological systems. Modern polychromatic flow cytometers simultaneously measure about 16 parameters routinely. The next-generation mass cytometry (CyTOF) technology allows for the simultaneous measurement of 50 or more parameters. Even as the cytometry technology is rapidly advancing, approaches for analyzing such complex data remain inadequate. The widely-used manual gating analysis is knowledge-driven and easy-to- interpret, but it is subjective, labor-intensive, and not scalable to handle the increasing complexity of the data. Recent developments of automated data-driven algorithms are able to address the issues of manual gating, but the results from data-driven algorithms are often not intuitive for biology experts to interpret. These limitations create a critical bottleneck for flow and mass cytometry analysis. The overall objective of this application is to develop a novel framework that combines both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches to achieve automated gating analysis of flow cytometry and CyTOF data. The specific aims are: (1) build knowledge graphs to capture existing knowledge of manual gating analysis, (2) develop algorithms for automated gating analysis, and (3) validate the knowledge graph framework using large-scale studies in ImmPort. The proposed research is significant because it will enable efficient and reproducible gating analysis and provide visualizations that are easy-to-interpret, both of which are critically important to the research community. Such contributions will fundamentally impact single-cell analysis of cellular heterogeneity in diverse fields including immunology, infectious diseases, cancer, AIDS, among others. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is expected to develop novel computational methods for automated analysis and interpretation of single-cell analysis by flow and mass cytometry.

"The Human Body Atlas: High-Resolution, Functional Mapping of Voxel, Vector, and Meta Datasets Project Summary/Abstract The ultimate goal of the HIVE MC-IU effort is to develop a common coordinate framework (CCF) for the healthy human body that supports the cataloguing, exploration, and download of differenttypes of tissue and individual cell data. The CCF will use different visual interfaces in order to exploit human and machine intelligence to improve data exploration and communication. The proposed effort combines decades of expertise in data and network visualization, scientific visualization, biology, and biomedical data standards. The goal is to develop a highly accurate and extensible multidimensional spatial basemap of the human body with associated data overlays. This basemap will be designed for online exploration as an atlas of tissue maps composed of diverse cell types, developed in close collaboration with the HIVE MC-NYGC team. To implement this functionality, we will develop methods to map and connect metadata, pixel/voxel data, and extracted vector data, allowing users to “navigate” across multiple levels (whole body, organ, tissue, cells). MC-IU will work in close collaboration with the HIVE Infrastructure and Engagement Component (IEC) and tools components (TCs) to connect and integrate further computational, analytical, visualization, and biometric resources driven by spatial context. Project Narrative This project will create a high-resolution, functional mapping of voxel, vector, and meta datasets in support of integration, interoperability, and visualization of biomedical HuBMAP data and models. We will create an extensible common coordinate framework (CCF) to facilitate the integration of diverse image-based data at spatial scales ranging from the molecular to the anatomical.

"Spatially Resolved Dynamics of Molecular Pathology and Intercellular Interactions in Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis Project Abstract Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease in which the loss of upper (primary motor cortex, M1) and lower (spinal cord, SC) motor neurons (MNs) ultimately leads to total paralysis. MN loss in ALS involves cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous activities in multiple cell types of the M1 and SC, the organization of which are well understood. However, there remain 4 major gaps in our knowledge: 1) How ALS-associated molecular pathology in the various cell types of the M1 relates to those in the SC; 2) How subpopulations of specific cell types are spatially arranged in these two regions; 3) How subpopulations of different cell types are organized in higher-order ensembles; and 4) How the coordinated behavior of these ensembles relates to disease-associated molecular pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). Towards addressing these questions, we propose to develop a spatially resolved multi-omics catalog of cellular subpopulations in the M1 and SC of patients with ALS and healthy controls. By using a combination of approaches to simultaneously map the spatial transcriptome and proteome of all interacting cellular subpopulations in these regions, our aim is to elucidate the origins and temporal dynamics of inter- and intra-cellular activities that may reveal novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets for ALS. Our overarching hypothesis is that ALS pathology stems from dysfunctional MN-glial interactions, and that this predictably differs in the M1 and SC in accordance with patient symptomatology. To address this hypothesis, we propose to use spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic measurements to study intact human postmortem tissue from patients stratified by clinical presentation (i.e., site of initial symptom presentation, bulbar or lower limb). We have previously implemented Spatial Transcriptomics on mouse and human SC to identify regional differences within subpopulations of various cell types that vary as a function of disease dynamics. Here, we propose to build upon our existing human study, and for the first time, develop a spatially resolved multi-omics dataset at scale and in the context of disease in matched human postmortem M1 and SC samples (Aim 1), to enable simultaneous exploration of upper and lower motor neurons in the context of intact tissue. These data will be directly tied to measures of ALS pathology (e.g., pathognomonic inclusions). To integrate and analyze relationships between data across modalities, we will develop a computational framework for harmonized analysis of multi-modal, multi- omic measures of ALS disease burden (Aim 2). Finally, we will implement highly multiplexed immuno-imaging to validate top gene candidates generated in Aim 1 at a single-cell level in situ (Aim 3). We expect to obtain an unmatched view of cellular interactions in the postmortem ALS M1 and SC, and to be able to directly link such interactions to features of ALS pathology in situ. This will allow us to identify dysregulated signaling that drives upper and lower motor neuron loss and associated symptoms in patients in ALS. Project Narrative Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease for which there are no biomarkers and only limited treatments stemming from a poor understanding of its pathogenesis. Here, we propose to integrate novel computational methods with spatially resolved transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of clinically deep-phenotyped postmortem ALS brains and spinal cords to determine the specific molecular correlates of functional impairment in this disease. By integrating these data with WGS and RNAseq data, our ultimate goal is to unveil how disease-associated variants drive specific dysfunction in ALS, which may in turn foster precision medicine-based treatment strategies.",Spatially Resolved Dynamics of Molecular Pathology and Intercellular Interactions in Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis,10086894,R01NS116350,"['ALS pathology', 'ALS patients', 'Address', 'Age', 'Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Catalogs', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Fostering', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Gene Proteins', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'In Situ', 'Indirect Immunofluorescence', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Lower Extremity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Motor Cortex', 'Motor Neurons', 'Multiomic Data', 'Mus', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Onset of illness', 'Paralysed', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Primary Lateral Sclerosis', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publishing', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Spinal Cord', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Variant', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cell type', 'computer framework', 'data integration', 'functional disability', 'graph theory', 'human study', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'molecular dynamics', 'molecular pathology', 'mouse model', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuron loss', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'patient stratification', 'precision medicine', 'protein TDP-43', 'regional difference', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'stem', 'symptomatology', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'treatment strategy']",NINDS,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,R01,2021,576665
"San Diego Nathan Shock Center PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Since aging is the biggest risk factor of most human diseases and the overall functional decline in individuals, there is great interest in understanding its biological underpinnings, with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of healthy and productive years of human life (i.e., healthspan). Conserved mechanisms of aging and longevity have been identified via investigations into the basic biology of aging. These include studies in model organisms that have also shown that aging is pliable, opening the door for healthspan-promoting interventions. However, a major complicating factor that impedes our understanding of aging and our ability to intervene is the intrinsic and induced heterogeneity of the process. Distinct cell types have intrinsically different aging modalities, and even identical cell types age at different rates depending on physiological context or environmental exposures. These and other cellular heterogeneities (e.g., altered epigenetic states and gene expression) can drive tissue dysfunction and age-related pathology that ultimately impact healthspan and lifespan. Unravelling this complexity experimentally requires application of robust single-cell and imaging approaches to address the heterogeneity of cellular aging head-on, as well as computational and mathematical modelling approaches to illuminate aging networks and pathway interactions that involve known hallmarks of aging. Another major gap in aging research is the need for new and better human cell and tissue models to allow basic research directly relevant to human aging.

"Diversity Candidate Research Supplement to Study Human Cell Models of Aging PROJECT SUMMARY – Overall Since aging is the biggest risk factor of most human diseases and the overall functional decline in individuals, there is great interest in understanding its biological underpinnings, with the ultimate goal of increasing the number of healthy and productive years of human life (i.e., healthspan). Conserved mechanisms of aging and longevity have been identified via investigations into the basic biology of aging. These include studies in model organisms that have also shown that aging is pliable, opening the door for healthspan-promoting interventions. However, a major complicating factor that impedes our understanding of aging and our ability to intervene is the intrinsic and induced heterogeneity of the process. Distinct cell types have intrinsically different aging modalities, and even identical cell types age at different rates depending on physiological context or environmental exposures. These and other cellular heterogeneities (e.g., altered epigenetic states and gene expression) can drive tissue dysfunction and age-related pathology that ultimately impact healthspan and lifespan. Unravelling this complexity experimentally requires application of robust single-cell and imaging approaches to address the heterogeneity of cellular aging head-on, as well as computational and mathematical modelling approaches to illuminate aging networks and pathway interactions that involve known hallmarks of aging. Another major gap in aging research is the need for new and better human cell and tissue models to allow basic research directly relevant to human aging. Thus, the overarching premise of the proposed San Diego Nathan Shock Center (SD-NSC) is to create the requisite infrastructure to facilitate and promote the systematic study of cellular heterogeneity in aging and to provide novel cell and tissue models for basic human aging studies.

"Center for Integrated Cellular Analysis Abstract While rapid advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing are yielding comprehensive taxonomies of cell states in the human body, understanding the complex molecular and environmental factors that regulate cell behavior remains a central challenge. New methods for simultaneous measurement of multiple molecular modalities, spatial context, and lineage relationships are needed to address this goal, but are currently outside the scope of present technologies which largely focus on a single data type. We propose to create a Center for Integrated Cellular Analysis, with a mission to develop a comprehensive suite of technologies and analytical methods to measure and integrate the molecular and environmental determinants of cellular identity. To achieve these goals, we propose the following series of synergistic Aims that will be developed in parallel: 1) Develop massively- parallel assays to simultaneously profile multiple molecular components across millions of cells; 2) Identify the spatial and environmental determinants of cellular state in complex interacting populations; 3) Develop scalable platforms to profile inherited molecular components, and determine the role of cell lineage in establishing molecular and phenotypic differences across cells; and 4) Develop methods to harmonize single- cell profiles across distinct modalities, enabling the inference of cellular identity. Our Center will address critical challenges in data integration, and produce software and protocols that will be applicable to diverse biological systems. We will share these resources broadly with the community, alongside a broader educational focus to encourage New York City students from under-represented backgrounds to pursue academic training in Genomics and Systems Biology. Project Narrative Understanding how the molecular components, inherited lineage, and spatial milieu of single cells dictate function in health and disease remains a key outstanding challenge in genomics. The overarching goal of our Center for Integrated Cellular Analysis is to develop methods to simultaneously assess these multimodal cellular properties, develop tools to harmonize them to allow inferential assessment of cell identity based on partial phenotyping, and share these developments with the broad scientific community while encouraging community engagement through education and outreach. Success in our strategy will facilitate deep, multi-omic phenotyping of single cells for basic research and clinical applications.",Center for Integrated Cellular Analysis,10176553,RM1HG011014,"['Academic Training', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Communication', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Copy Number Polymorphism', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Education and Outreach', 'Ensure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epitopes', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human body', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'In Situ', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Membrane Proteins', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'New York City', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Protocols documentation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Resolution', 'Resource Sharing', 'Role', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Students', 'Systems Biology', 'Taxonomy', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cell behavior', 'clinical application', 'combinatorial', 'cost', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'epigenome', 'experimental study', 'extracellular', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'insight', 'molecular phenotype', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'novel strategies', 'outreach', 'reconstruction', 'single cell sequencing', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'tool', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,NEW YORK GENOME CENTER,RM1,2021,2935850
"Discovery and characterization of novel ciliopathy protein complexes Abstract Ciliopathies are a collection of debilitating developmental disorders (e.g. Joubert syndrome, Meckel syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, orofaciodigital syndrome, polycystic kidney disease) which have no cures and limited but expensive treatments. Diagnosis and treatment is complicated due to ciliopathies causing multisystem pathologies and having large variance in their clinical presentations potentially resulting in neural tube defects, orofacial clefting, obesity, polycystic kidneys, retinal degeneration and in some cases, infant death. All ciliopathies are caused by dysfunctional cilia, the microtubule based organelle critical for cell-to-cell signaling, but currently there is limited understanding of the underlying molecular network responsible for proper cilia function. Recently, large-scale proteomic techniques have advanced where it is now possible to query the cell's molecular network and identify many new protein complexes. This proposal describes a research program that will 1) construct a ciliary complex map using proteomic techniques, 2) functionally characterize newly discovered ciliary complexes and 3) identify disruptions in complex assembly due to known ciliopathy mutations. Additional products of the proposed research will include a compendium of proteomic data on ciliated cells, statistical analysis tools for the discovery of protein complexes, functional characterization of critical ciliary processes and a more complete understanding of the underlying molecular network of ciliopathy disease states. This work aims to provide an important perspective of cilia biology in order to better understand the complex etiology and molecular causes of ciliopathies and potentially open new therapeutic avenues. Project Narrative Ciliopathies are a class of debilitating birth defects without known cures and limited but expensive treatments. Currently, we lack understanding of the underlying molecular network in ciliopathy patient cells and know even less about the causes of clinical presentations in ciliopathy patients. I propose to discover the differences in the molecular network between healthy cells and ciliopathy patient cells in an effort to better understand the molecular causes of clinical presentations possibly open new avenues for therapeutics.""""""",Discovery and characterization of novel ciliopathy protein complexes,10291010,R00HD092613,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Bardet-Biedl Syndrome', 'Biochemical', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Cells', 'Cilia', 'Cilium Microtubule', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computational Biology', 'Congenital Abnormality', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Developmental Cell Biology', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Embryo', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fractionation', 'Future', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Human', 'Ion Exchange', 'Joubert syndrome', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Meckel-Gruber syndrome', 'Mentors', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sieve Chromatography', 'Mus', 'Mutation', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Obesity', 'Organelles', 'Orofaciodigital Syndromes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Polycystic Kidney Diseases', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Rana', 'Recording of previous events', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Retinal Degeneration', 'Role', 'Sea Anemones', 'Sea Urchins', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structural Models', 'Structure of ciliary processes', 'Syndrome', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Work', 'Xenopus laevis', 'base', 'cell type', 'ciliopathy', 'clinically relevant', 'developmental disease', 'educational atmosphere', 'fly', 'human disease', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'infant death', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'loss of function', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'orofacial cleft', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein function', 'skills', 'success', 'tool']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R00,2021,249000
"Integrated visualization, control, and analysis of GEF – GTPase networks in living cells A small number of Rho family GTPases participate in a broad array of fundamental cellular behaviors. Specificity is possible due to spatial and temporal control of GTPase “activation”; Guanine exchange factors (GEFs) generate activated, GTP-bound GTPases with precise timing and localization, while specialized interactions with adhesion molecules, membrane domains and other localized structures specify GEF-GTPase interactions. GEF/GTPase circuits are complex, with localized feedbacks, multiple GEFs controlling one GTPase, and vice versa. To dissect this spatiotemporally regulated circuitry requires imaging, and new analytical techniques that can dissect causal relationships from imaging data. Following the intentions of PAR- 19-158 (Bioengineering Research Grants), we propose a multidisciplinary collaboration leveraging organic chemistry, protein engineering, imaging, and computer science to fudnamentally advance signal transduction imaging and analysis. As a biological testbed we will explore the role of GEF-GTPase interactions in cell protrusion, single cell migration and collective migration. We will develop a generalizable approach to GEF biosensors, and adapt our proven GTPase biosensors to image GEF and GTPase activities in the same cell. Because GEF-GTPase interactions are heterogeneous and complex, multiplexed imaging is necessary to quantify their relative dynamics. However, perturbation of cell behavior is especially problematic when using two biosensors in the same cell. We will therefore develop new biosensor designs that greatly reduce cell perturbation. Even the most precise imaging of overlapping molecular activations has not revealed causal relationships. We will therefore adopt the framework of Granger Causality inference, which was originally devised for financial market analysis, to extract causal connections and feedback interactions from imaging data. Numerous steps will be necessary to translate the existing concepts of Granger causality to the analysis of spatially and temporally distributed molecular processes. Most importantly, we will implement a schema for Granger causality inference in multivariate time series models that will capture spatial relations, and we will combine principles of high-dimensional statistical regression with approaches from control theory to estimate information flows between variables that are coupled by strong feedbacks. We will also develop a novel clustering approach that preserves the neighborhood topology of data in a high-dimensional feature space and in the Euclidian space of the cell outline to identify signaling microdomains. Finally, to test and confirm our hypotheses, we will use new photo-activatable and photo-inhibitable analogs of GEFs together with GTPase biosensors to control one protein while observing another. This research plan will produce biosensors with reduced perturbation, biosensor/optogenetic multiplexing capabilities, and image analysis/modeling approaches necessary to shed light on the network topology of nonlinear, spatiotemporally controlled signaling pathways. All tools will efficiently deployed to the community. In this project we are developing new ways to understand the mechanisms by which cells interpret, and in cancer misinterpret, the host of stimuli from outside and inside the cell that determine behavior. We are building molecules that can report, through light emission, the behavior of multiple key elements of the cellular “decision making circuits”, and in parallel developing new mathematical tools to interpret the output of these molecules, and to integrate this data into overall models that reveal information flow in the circuitry. We are also developing the ability to control one circuit component while watching the activity of another, enabling us to dissect out causal relationships within cellular circuits.","Integrated visualization, control, and analysis of GEF – GTPase networks in living cells",10221568,R01CA252826,"['Actomyosin', 'Acute', 'Address', 'Adhesions', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Architecture', 'Basic Science', 'Behavior', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biosensor', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Family', 'Feedback', 'Fiber', 'Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer', 'GTP Binding', 'Guanine', 'Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors', 'Guanosine Triphosphate Phosphohydrolases', 'Homeostasis', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Label', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Membrane', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Morphogenesis', 'Neighborhoods', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Oncogenic', 'Organic Chemistry', 'Output', 'Pathway interactions', 'Play', 'Process', 'Protein Engineering', 'Proteins', 'Proxy', 'Regression Analysis', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Route', 'Series', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signal Transduction Pathway', 'Site', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Visualization', 'analog', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'cell behavior', 'cell motility', 'computer science', 'control theory', 'design', 'econometrics', 'guanine analog', 'high dimensionality', 'image processing', 'imaging approach', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'light emission', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical theory', 'migration', 'multiplexed imaging', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'preservation', 'response', 'rho', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins', 'single molecule', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NCI,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,541157
"Dynamic µOCT for cellular tissue phenotyping Phenotyping cells and tissue is a critical function that spans basic science to clinical diagnosis. Yet, established methods for phenotyping cells in tissue are static, are evaluated when the tissue is dead, and typically involve destruction of the sample. This paradigm misses an entire dimension represented by cellular function and activity, information that is potentially of great significance in understanding cell/tissue state. Recently, a new field has emerged that uses coherence-gated imaging to quantify living tissue motion as a proxy of cellular function and activity. Coherence-based motility imaging is relatively new - much remains to be learned about the nature of its dynamic signal. In addition, many of the coherence-gated technologies described to date lack the resolution to investigate individual cells. The ones that are capable of seeing cells do not provide cross-sectional images and thus miss important architectural patterns associated with tissue maturation. We have developed a form of coherence-gated imaging called 1-µm optical coherence tomography (µOCT). µOCT has a resolution of 1 µm axial by 2 µm lateral, enabling cross-sectional visualization of tissue at the cellular level. Recently, we have discovered that by sequentially acquiring multiple µOCT images and computing the pixel-per-pixel power spectrum, we observe a dramatic increase in image contrast and new information emerging from the µOCT datasets. Preliminary studies with this new technology, termed dynamic µOCT (DµOCT), suggest that it can be used to visualize epithelial maturation, cell death/apoptosis, and cellular activity. In this grant, we will mature this technology by conducting key validation studies in a variety of clinically relevant human tissues, animal models, and spheroids to understand the dynamic signal and determine its accuracy for diagnosing pathology, activity, and response to therapy (apoptosis/necrosis) (Aim 1). We also will advance DµOCT further by increasing spatial and temporal resolution, creating new data mining analysis pipelines, and developing and validating technology and probes that enable DµOCT to be implemented in vivo (Aim 2). By expanding our understanding and implementation of this exciting technology, we hope to provide a powerful new tool that will have significant and wide-reaching impact in the biological and clinical sciences. In this proposal we will develop a cross-sectional imaging technology termed dynamic µOCT (DµOCT) that identifies distinct cells and tissues using intracellular motility signatures, a proxy of cell activity and state. Research will involve conducting a series of experiments in spheroids, animals, and human tissue to understand the nature of the dynamic signal and determine the diagnostic capacity of this technology for distinguishing disease, cell/tissue activity, and response to therapy. We additionally will develop next generation DµOCT technology that will increase resolution, provide more powerful diagnostic algorithms, and enable the use of DµOCT in living patients.",Dynamic µOCT for cellular tissue phenotyping,10221328,R01CA265742,"['3-Dimensional', 'ANXA5 gene', 'Algorithms', 'Animal Model', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptotic', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Maturation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Epithelial', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescence Microscopy', 'Frequencies', 'Gold', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lateral', 'Light', 'Measures', 'Melanoma Cell', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Morphology', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Necrosis', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Optics', 'Organism', 'Organoids', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Phase-Contrast Microscopy', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Process', 'Propidium Diiodide', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Skin', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Upper digestive tract structure', 'Visualization', 'analysis pipeline', 'animal tissue', 'base', 'cell motility', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinically relevant', 'contrast imaging', 'data mining', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease diagnosis', 'drug efficacy', 'experimental study', 'histological slides', 'human tissue', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microdevice', 'mouse model', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'temporal measurement', 'three dimensional cell culture', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NCI,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2021,619861
"Interpretable deep learning models for translational medicine Understanding the state of cellular signaling systems provides insights to how cells behave under physiological and pathological conditions. Cellular signaling systems are organized as hierarchy (cascade) and signals of a molecular is often compositionally encoded to control cellular processes, such as gene expression. This project aims to develop advanced deep learning models (DLMs) to simulate cellular signaling systems based on gene expression data. In last 3 years, the project has made significant progresses, but the challenges remain. Importantly, contemporary DLMs behave as “black boxes”, in that it is difficult to interpret how signals are encoded and how to interpret which signal a hidden node represent in a DLM. This black-box nature prevents researchers from gaining biological insights using DLMs, even though these models can be much superior in modeling data than other types of models in many tasks, e.g., predicting drug sensitivity of cancer cells. In this competitive renewal, we propose to develop novel DLMs and innovative inference algorithms to train “interpretable” DLMs and apply them in translational research. The proposed research is innovative and of high significance in several perspectives: 1) Our novel DLMs and algorithms take advantage of big data resulting from systematic chemical/genetic perturbations of cellular signaling machinery, so that we can use the perturbation condition as side information to reveal how signals are encoded in a DLM. 2) We integrate principles of causal inference and information theory with deep learning method to make DLMs interpretable. As results, that researchers can gain mechanistic insights from such models. 3) Innovative application of interpretable DLMs will advance translational research. For example, we will train interpretable DLMs to model cellular signaling at the level of single cells and use this information investigate inter-cellular interactions among cells in tumor microenvironment to shed light on immune evasion mechanisms of cancers. We will also use information derived from interpretable DLMs to predict cancer cell drug sensitivity. We anticipate that our study will bring forth significant advances not only in deep learning methodology but also in precision medicine. This project aims to develop advance machine learning methods, referred to as deep learning models, to simulate cellular signaling systems, at both multiple cell and single cell levels. Success of these models will enable researchers to investigate cellular behaviors under physiological and pathological condition, and such information can be used to guide therapy of cancer patients.",Interpretable deep learning models for translational medicine,10171908,R01LM012011,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Event', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Grain', 'Human', 'Immune Evasion', 'Immunotherapy', 'Individual', 'Information Theory', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Light', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Messenger RNA', 'Methodology', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Network-based', 'Organoids', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Signaling Molecule', 'Structure', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Yeasts', 'base', 'biological systems', 'cancer cell', 'cancer therapy', 'cell behavior', 'chemical genetics', 'data modeling', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'drug sensitivity', 'experience', 'genome-wide', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'insight', 'learning algorithm', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'patient response', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'precision oncology', 'predicting response', 'prevent', 'response', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics', 'translational impact', 'translational medicine', 'translational model', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2021,309404
"National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) is to advance the science of biological networks by creating leading-edge bioinformatic methods, software tools and infrastructure, and by engaging the scientific community in a portfolio of collaboration and training opportunities. Much of biomedical research is dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types and scales, including molecular interactions among genes, proteins, metabolites and drugs; cell communication systems; relationships among genotypes and biological and clinical phenotypes; and patient and social networks. NRNB-supported platforms like Cytoscape are among the most widely used software tools in biology, with tens of thousands of active users, enabling researchers to apply network concepts and data to understand biological systems and how they are reprogrammed in disease.  NRNB’s three Technology Research and Development projects introduce innovative concepts with the potential to transform network biology, transitioning it from a static to a dynamic science (TR&D 1); from flat network diagrams to multi-scale hierarchies of biological structure and function (TR&D 2); and from descriptive interaction maps to predictive and interpretable machine learning models (TR&D 3). In previous funding periods our technology projects have produced novel and highly cited approaches, including network-based biomarkers for stratification of disease, data-driven gene ontologies assembled completely from network data, and deep learning models of cell structure and function built using biological networks as a scaffold.  During the next period of support, we introduce dynamic regulatory networks formulated from single-cell transcriptomics and advanced proteomics data (TR&D 1); substantially improved methodology for the study of hierarchical structure and pleiotropy in biological networks (TR&D 2); and procedures for using networks to seed machine learning models of drug response that are both mechanistically interpretable and transferable across biomedical contexts (TR&D 3). These efforts are developed and applied in close collaboration with outside investigators from 19 Driving Biomedical Projects who specialize in experimental generation of network data, disease biology (cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes), single-cell developmental biology, and clinical trials. TR&Ds are also bolstered by 7 Technology Partnerships in which NRNB scientists coordinate technology development with leading resource-development groups in gene function prediction, mathematics and algorithm development, and biomedical databases. Beyond these driving collaborations, we continually support a broader portfolio of transient (non-driving) research collaborations; organize and lead international meetings including the popular Network Biology track of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference; and deliver a rich set of training opportunities and network analysis protocols. OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We are all familiar with some of the components of biological systems – DNA, proteins, cells, organs, individuals – but understanding biological systems involves more than just cataloging its component parts. It is critical to understand the many interactions of these parts within systems, and how these systems give rise to biological functions and responses and determine states of health and disease.

"Pathogenesis of Primary Biliary Cholangitis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The major goal of this proposal is to conduct the first multi-omics translational study of Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC), thereby identifying the systems-level networks driving pathological processes in this rare, autoimmune liver disease. Improved understanding of PBC pathogenesis is urgently needed to inform tailored care and the development of new effective therapies. Comprehensive assessments of immunity and the role of environmental influence in PBC are currently lacking. Such evaluations would provide critical knowledge to leverage recent advances in the field’s ability to pharmacologically alter the immune system, thereby providing new hope to PBC patients. Having made significant contributions to the understanding of the genomic architecture underlying development of autoimmunity in PBC, we propose a novel, patient-oriented, multi- omics approach. In this new application, we will decipher how peripheral cellular immunity and non-cellular circulating factors contribute to PBC pathogenesis. We hypothesize that multi-omic analyses integrating cellular and non-cellular factors will identify systems-level pathways driving PBC pathogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we develop an innovative platform that combines aspects of machine learning and quantum statistical mechanics to identify omics-based signatures of PBC that when integrated with clinical features will unveil biological pathways driving disease pathogenesis.  To perform this multi-omic study of PBC, we have assembled a world-class, multi-disciplinary team synergizing expertise in PBC biology and omics-scale analytics as well as resources across Mayo Clinic and Columbia University. With a new, in-hand collection of diverse biological specimens from 300 deeply- phenotyped PBC patients and 300 well-matched controls, our studies are already underway with preliminary data demonstrating measureable immunome, methylome, inflammatory protein, exposome, and metabolome differences between PBC patients and controls. In Aim 1, we thoroughly evaluate peripheral immune composition (the immunome) and activation state (methylome, transcriptome, inflammatory proteins) using mass-cytometry (CyTOF), sequencing- and proximity extension-based methods. In Aim 2, we perform a cutting-edge study of exogenous chemicals “the exposome” and endogenous metabolites “the metabolome” using ultrahigh resolution mass spectroscopy to discover pathogenic alterations in metabolism in PBC. We also develop an assay to quantify liver-specific cell-free DNA in blood as a measure of disease severity. In Aim 3, we integrate omic-specific signatures (Aims 1 and 2) using a novel approach to identify and prioritize PBC- associated features for further biological investigation. We then infer clinically-relevant subgroups of PBC patients by performing similarity network fusion analysis. In summary, using state-of-the-art, multi-omic analyses, we will discover systems-level networks driving PBC pathogenesis, spurring development of new hypotheses and studies designed to elucidate PBC pathobiology and identify novel therapies. PROJECT NARRATIVE We will conduct the first multi-omics translational study of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), to improve understanding of the culprits driving this rare, autoimmune liver disease. By integrating multiple layers of omics data, we will better define the architecture of cellular networks driving PBC. In so doing, we will identify molecular signatures including immune alterations, environmental toxins, and metabolism-related chemicals unique to PBC patients, thereby spurring improved understanding of PBC pathobiology and identification of novel druggable targets.",Pathogenesis of Primary Biliary Cholangitis,10095117,R01DK126691,"['Architecture', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Autoimmunity', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Blood', 'Caring', 'Cellular Immunity', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Cytometry', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Heel', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Liver', 'Liver diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Primary biliary cirrhosis', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Publications', 'Questionnaires', 'Research Design', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severity of illness', 'Specimen', 'Statistical Mechanics', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Toxic Environmental Substances', 'Universities', 'Work', 'advanced disease', 'base', 'biobank', 'cell free DNA', 'clinically relevant', 'combinatorial', 'effective therapy', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'metabolome', 'methylome', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'patient oriented', 'quantum', 'response', 'toxin metabolism', 'transcriptome', 'translational study']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC ROCHESTER,R01,2021,628683
"AI-driven biomarker analysis of intact whole brains imaged at micron and sub-micron resolution Abstract. Whole-organ 3D immunohistochemistry is revolutionizing the field of neuroscience, enabling unprecedented insight into the distribution of neural cells and neurological markers throughout the brain in health and disease. LifeCanvas Technologies is at the forefront of the new field of spatial proteomics, providing a complete workflow for whole-organ preservation, tissue clearing, immunohistochemical labeling, and imaging. Nevertheless, an ongoing challenge for such studies is the need to rapidly, reproducibly and rigorously quantify terabyte-sized datasets from whole-organ imaging efforts. While progress has been made in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools to enable detection of cellular and sub-cellular markers in neural tissue, one-size-fits-all algorithms are inadequate for analyzing complex, information-rich brain datasets due to varying biomolecular expression patterns (e.g. nuclear, cytoplasmic, membrane-bound) and region-specific heterogeneities in cell density and neural cell types. However, AI-driven algorithms targeting a subset of labeling patterns can be effective provided the availability of adequate training data. LifeCanvas Technologies LCT is optimally positioned to develop highly accurate algorithms serving a wide range of detection tasks through its access to high volumes of whole-organ image data containing a variety of label expression patterns via its Contract Research Organization and user base. LCT proposes to develop a data analysis program, SmartAnalytics, which will embed a suite of AI algorithms within a user-friendly software package to identify labeled cell locations and characterize morphological features across the whole brain at cellular and sub-cellular resolution. Specifically, LCT will use intact, 3D immunolabeled mouse brains to design AI algorithms to detect labeled cells imaged at cellular resolution and generate further algorithms for the segmentation of labeled features imaged at sub-micron resolution. Data from LCT’s Contract Research Organization and academic collaborations will be continually fed back to improve and expand the library of detection algorithms available within SmartAnalytics, and these developments will drive further customer adoption and enhancement of future versions of the software. SmartAnalytics will guide users through model application, quality-control testing, and the generation of output products such as figures and summary statistics. In summary, SmartAnalytics will be an evolving and user- friendly workflow execution program that enables neuroscientists to take full advantage of their 3D image data, driving new discoveries in brain function, development and disease. Narrative. The ability to readily and accurately quantify proteomic expression patterns that define neural cell- type specific distributions and morphologies across intact brains will enable unprecedented and unbiased insights into studies of brain function. LifeCanvas Technologies’ state-of-the-art tissue processing pipeline provides uniform clearing, labeling, and imaging of whole brains at cellular and sub-cellular resolution. By developing Artificial Intelligence algorithms to detect labeled cells and determine morphologies and by packaging these algorithms in a user-friendly software ‘SmartAnalytics’, LifeCanvas will enable neuroscientists to quantify image data and derive critical results towards a more complete understanding of brain function in development, health and disease.",AI-driven biomarker analysis of intact whole brains imaged at micron and sub-micron resolution,10139966,R43MH125512,"['3-Dimensional', 'Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Antibodies', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytes', 'Automobile Driving', 'Back', 'Binding Proteins', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Density', 'Cell membrane', 'Cells', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cytoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Feedback', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Label', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Maps', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nuclear', 'Organ', 'Organ Preservation', 'Output', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Quality Control', 'Research Contracts', 'Resolution', 'Rosaniline Dyes', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissue imaging', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'algorithm development', 'base', 'biomarker-driven', 'cell type', 'cellular imaging', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'extracellular', 'improved', 'insight', 'intelligent algorithm', 'neuronal cell body', 'new technology', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'segmentation algorithm', 'software development', 'statistics', 'submicron', 'terabyte', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"LIFECANVAS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.",R43,2021,226754
"Manifold representations and active learning for 21 st century biology Project Summary With the rise of high-throughput sequencing and multiplexed biotechnologies enabling single-cell multi-omics and massively parallel CRISPR experiments, the biomedical community is generating a monumental amount of data. These data promise to reveal new biology and drive personal and precision medicine. However, the sheer volume of genomic data is overwhelming current computational resources, requiring prohibitively high compute time, memory usage, and storage. My lab has been at the forefront of solving big data challenges in genomics, designing novel algorithms that enable efficient and secure analyses that were previously computationally infeasible, and that reveal novel structural, cellular, and systems biology. Drawing upon our expertise in developing scalable and insightful algorithms for analyzing genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, we aim to tackle two key data-driven challenges facing the biological community: 1) efficient, accurate, and robust characterization of tissues at the single-cell level, and 2) translating high-throughput datasets into biological discoveries via machine learning-based prediction. To solve the first challenge, we will leverage our discovery that seemingly high-dimensional sequencing data often lies on low-dimensional manifolds that capture the underlying biological state of interest. We will design algorithms that generate these compact, meaningful manifold representations of single-cell omics datasets. This will enable a number of key applications including characterizing co-expression and gene-modules that define healthy and pathologic cell states; integrating multi-modal single-cell omics datasets to more richly characterize cellular diversity; and investigating the mechanisms underlying transcriptomic diversity across tissues and developmental states. To solve the second challenge, we will take a two-pronged approach. First, we will design novel machine learning frameworks that provide a measure of confidence when predicting in unfamiliar biological states, enabling prediction that is robust to “out-of-distribution” (unobserved) examples. We will then work with our experimental collaborators and CROs to rapidly perform experimental validation of model-based predictions. Finally, we will return the experimental results to the model to further improve performance. This will enable an “active learning” feedback loop to efficiently explore a complex biological space for outcomes of interest. We will use this uncertainty-powered active learning approach to explore several pressing biological concerns such as the identification of small molecule compounds with enzymatic or whole-cell growth inhibitory properties, efficient design of spatial- transcriptomic experiments, computationally guided CRISPR perturbation experiments, and identification of functional non-coding mutations. This project will result in 1) numerous software tools with wide utility that efficiently analyze massive biological datasets and guide complex experimentation, and 2) reveal biological insights, especially into biomolecular interactions and cellular heterogeneity. Project Narrative The rise of high-throughput genomic profiling of individual cells and efficient, targeted manipulation of cellular phenotypes (including CRISPR-based genetic perturbations) promise to revolutionize our understanding of cellular biology and disease. However, realizing this revolution will require new computing paradigms that can integrate and analyze these massive datasets and suggest new biological hypotheses and experimental designs. Here we develop novel computational algorithms and software for tackling these challenges to characterize cellular diversity and improve our ability to manipulate cells to understand and treat disease.",Manifold representations and active learning for 21 st century biology,10207091,R35GM141861,"['Active Learning', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Secure', 'Software Tools', 'Spatial Design', 'State Interests', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cell growth', 'computing resources', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2021,478341
