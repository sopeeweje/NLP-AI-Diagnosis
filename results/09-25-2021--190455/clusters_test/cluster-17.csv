"Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION) PROJECT SUMMARY: Trauma to the spinal cord and brain (neurotrauma) together impact over 2.5 million people per year in the US, with economic costs of $80 billion in healthcare and loss-of-productivity. Yet precise pathophysiological processes impacting recovery remain poorly understood. This lack of knowledge limits the reliability of therapeutic development in animal models and limits translation across species and into humans. Part of the problem is that neurotrauma is intrinsically complex, involving heterogeneous damage to the central nervous system (CNS), the most complex organ system in the body. This results in a multifarious CNS syndrome spanning across heterogeneous data sources and multiple scales of analysis. Multi-scale heterogeneity makes spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) difficult to understand using traditional analytical approaches that focus on a single endpoint for testing therapeutic efficacy. Single endpoint-testing provides a narrow window into the complex system of changes that describe the holistic syndromes of SCI and TBI. In this sense, complex neurotrauma is fundamentally a problem that requires big- data analytics to evaluate reproducibility in basic discovery and cross-species translation. For the proposed TOP-VISION cooperative agreement we will: 1) integrate preclinical neurotrauma data on a large-scale; 2) develop novel applications of cutting-edge multidimensional analytics to make sense of complex neurotrauma data; and 3) validate bio-functional patterns in targeted big-data-to-bench experiments in multi-PI single center (UG3 phase), and multicenter (UH3 phase) studies. The goal of the proposed project is to develop an integrated workflow for preclinical discovery, reproducibility testing, and translational discovery both within and across neurotrauma types. Our team is well-positioned to execute this project given that with prior NIH funding we built one of the largest multicenter, multispecies repositories of neurotrauma data to-date, housing detailed multidimensional outcome data on nearly N=5000 preclinical subjects and over 20,000 curated variables. We will leverage these existing data resources and apply recent innovations from data science to render complex multidimensional endpoint data into robust syndromic patterns that can be visualized and explored by researchers and clinicians for discovery, hypothesis-generation and ultimately translational outcome testing. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Multicenter, multispecies central nervous system (spinal cord and brain) injury data provides a unique and clinically-relevant opportunity to discover translational outcomes, if we can develop analytical workflows that fully harness these data. Our team has assembled one of largest repositories of such data spanning across spinal cord injury and traumatic brain injury models under prior NIH support. The proposed cooperative agreement will expand data-sharing and big-data analytical workflows to render raw neurotrauma data into novel insights to promote bench-to-bedside translation.",Translational Outcomes Project: Visualizing Syndromic Information and Outcomes for Neurotrauma (TOP-VISION),10199067,UH3NS106899,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Commons', 'Data Element', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Science', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Drug Targeting', 'FAIR principles', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Housing', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Trauma', 'Mus', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neuraxis', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Assessment', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Precision Health', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Rattus', 'Recovery', 'Recovery of Function', 'Reproducibility', 'Research Personnel', 'Rodent', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Spinal Cord', 'Spinal Injuries', 'Spinal cord injury', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Translations', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Traumatic CNS injury', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'bench to bedside', 'biobehavior', 'biomarker discovery', 'body system', 'clinically relevant', 'cost', 'data curation', 'data integration', 'data repository', 'data resource', 'diverse data', 'economic cost', 'economic impact', 'experimental study', 'functional outcomes', 'heterogenous data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large scale data', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'precision medicine', 'preclinical study', 'predictive modeling', 'productivity loss', 'repository', 'response to injury', 'spinal cord and brain injury', 'success', 'therapeutic development', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",UH3,2021,323000
"Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data Big data is now ubiquitous in every field of modern scientific research. Many contemporary applications, such as the recent national microbiome initiative (NMI), greatly demand highly flexible statistical machine learning methods that can produce both interpretable and reproducible results. Thus, it is of paramount importance to identify crucial causal factors that are responsible for the response from a large number of available covariates, which can be statistically formulated as the false discovery rate (FDR) control in general high-dimensional nonlinear models. Despite the enormous applications of shotgun metagenomic studies, most existing investigations concentrate on the study of bacterial organisms. However, viruses and virus-host interactions play important roles in controlling the functions of the microbial communities. In addition, viruses have been shown to be associated with complex diseases. Yet, investigations into the roles of viruses in human diseases are significantly underdeveloped. The objective of this proposal is to develop mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient approaches to deal with highly complex big data and the applications of these approaches to solve fundamental and important biological and biomedical problems. There are four interrelated aims. In Aim 1, we will theoretically investigate the power of the recently proposed model-free knockoffs (MFK) procedure, which has been theoretically justified to control FDR in arbitrary models and arbitrary dimensions. We will also theoretically justify the robustness of MFK with respect to the misspecification of covariate distribution. These studies will lay the foundations for our developments in other aims. In Aim 2, we will develop deep learning approaches to predict viral contigs with higher accuracy, integrate our new algorithm with MFK to achieve FDR control for virus motif discovery, and investigate the power and robustness of our new procedure. In Aim 3, we will take into account the virus-host motif interactions and adapt our algorithms and theories in Aim 2 for predicting virus-host infectious interaction status. In Aim 4, we will apply the developed methods from the first three aims to analyze the shotgun metagenomics data sets in ExperimentHub to identify viruses and virus-host interactions associated with several diseases at some target FDR level. Both the algorithms and results will be disseminated through the web. The results from this study will be important for metagenomics studies under a variety of environments. Big data is ubiquitous in biological research. Identifying causal factors associated with complex diseases or traits from big data is highly important and challenging. New statistical and computational tools will be developed to control False Discovery Rate (FDR) for molecular sequence data based on the novel model-free knockoffs framework. They will be used to detect sequence motifs for viruses and motif-pairs for virus-host interactions, and to analyze multiple metagenomics data sets related to complex diseases.",Adaptive Reproducible High-Dimensional Nonlinear Inference for Big Biological Data,10159277,R01GM131407,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Archaea', 'Attention', 'Bacteria', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Bypass', 'Cells', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Effectiveness', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Frequencies', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic Materials', 'Genomics', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Length', 'Linear Regressions', 'Literature', 'Liver Cirrhosis', 'Mathematics', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neurosciences', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Non-linear Models', 'Obesity', 'Organism', 'Performance', 'Planet Earth', 'Play', 'Procedures', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Studies', 'Shotguns', 'Social Sciences', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Viral', 'Virus', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'biological research', 'computerized tools', 'contig', 'dark matter', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'design', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'human disease', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'machine learning method', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome research', 'model design', 'model development', 'new technology', 'novel', 'power analysis', 'response', 'simulation', 'statistical and machine learning', 'theories', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'virus host interaction', 'virus identification']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2021,276700
"Super Greedy Trees Project Summary/Abstract We identify critical weaknesses with Classiﬁcation and Regression Trees (CART), a widely used base learner for machine learning of big omic-data analysis, and propose to replace these with a fundamentally different type of base learner we call super greedy trees (SGT's). SGT's cut the space in a fundamentally different manner, resulting in a richer partition structure with provable consistency and superior empirical performance. The project will develop a uniﬁed SGT framework for big data analysis using machine learning including the treatment of time varying covariate survival analysis, unsupervised learning, highly imbalanced data and multivariate regression. The SGT framework will be deployed within scalable and extensible open source software that will allow NIGMS researchers to deploy them to deal with their challenging big data problems. Project Narrative We develop a comprehensive framework and scalable open source software for machine learning of big omic-data using super greedy tree base learners.",Super Greedy Trees,10086529,R35GM139659,"['Big Data', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Machine Learning', 'National Institute of General Medical Sciences', 'Performance', 'Research Personnel', 'Structure', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time', 'Trees', 'base', 'classification trees', 'open source', 'regression trees', 'unsupervised learning']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R35,2021,415245
"Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The emergence of electronic medical records, large data registries and readily accessible, protected servers have resulted in an explosion of digital information with potentially high clinical impact for improving patient management and outcomes. Big data warehouses that capture standardized information within the scope of clinical practices allow trained scientists to not only engage in traditional hypothesis testing, but to also uncover new hypotheses, refine existing theories and apply new discoveries to health assessments and interventions. Despite the accessibility and potential impact of these data platforms, clinician scientists have traditionally directed experiments that incorporate relatively small sample sizes and data from individual laboratories, and have not been trained in big data analytics or in engaging appropriate team scientists who work in this space, such as computer scientists, biostatisticians and engineers. The overarching goal of this proposal is to mentor early patient oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analytics and to mentor and involve early data science scholars in communication and swallowing research. The PI proposes four primary mentorship and research goals in this K24 renewal proposal: 1. Train a cadre of early stage communication and swallowing scientists in data science methods, including machine learning, by an expert, interdisciplinary, collaborative data science team, 2. Engage and introduce early career data scientists from fields of biostatistics, computer science and engineering to communication and swallowing sciences, and respective data sets, toward facilitating interdisciplinary data science teams and research productivity, 3. Apply novel data science methods to identify phenotypes of swallowing impairment and severity classifications in patient groups known to be at high risk for nutritional and health complications related to dysphagia, and 4. Develop a new area of research in machine learning applications toward improving reliability of physiologic swallowing assessment. The data science theme of the career development and research plan directly align with NIDCD's Strategic Plan for Data Science which lists as its mission: Storing, managing, standardizing and publishing the vast amounts of data produced by biomedical research. NIDCD recognizes that accessible, well-organized, secure and efficiently operated data resources are critical to modern scientific inquiry…and by maximizing the value of data generated through NIH-funded efforts, the pace of biomedical discoveries and medical breakthroughs for better health outcomes can be accelerated. PROJECT NARRATIVE The emergence of electronic health records exposes clinicians to massive amounts of information about the millions of patients who suffer from communication and swallowing disorders, yet most clinical scientists do not have the training or skill to apply meaning to the data toward improving patient care. The overarching mentorship goal of this proposal is to train early, patient-oriented communication and swallowing scientists in big data analyses, including computer machine learning approaches. The research project will uncover distinct patterns and severity of swallowing impairments in large groups of patients with high risk medical diagnoses, which will have high impact on patient care planning and identification of treatments that directly target these impairments for improved outcomes.",Data Science Applications in Communication andSwallowing Disorders,10073493,K24DC012801,"['Algorithms', 'Area', 'Award', 'Barium swallow', 'Big Data', 'Big Data Methods', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Biometry', 'Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communication impairment', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Deglutition', 'Deglutition Disorders', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Explosion', 'Funding', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Head and Neck Cancer', 'Health', 'Hearing', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Mid-Career Clinical Scientist Award (K24)', 'Mission', 'Modernization', 'National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders', 'Nutritional', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Productivity', 'Publishing', 'Registries', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sample Size', 'Science', 'Scientific Inquiry', 'Scientist', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Speech', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Strategic Planning', 'Stroke', 'Supervision', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'computer science', 'computerized', 'data registry', 'data resource', 'data warehouse', 'digital', 'experimental study', 'health assessment', 'high risk', 'human error', 'impression', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'learning algorithm', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'programs', 'research and development', 'skills', 'statistical learning', 'theories', 'uptake']",NIDCD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,K24,2021,183209
"Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data PROJECT SUMMARY In this dawning era of `Big Data' it is vital to recruit and train the next generation of biomedical data scientists in `Big Data'. The collection of `Big Data' in the biomedical sciences is growing rapidly and has the potential to solve many of today's pressing medical needs including personalized medicine, eradication of disease, and curing cancer. Realizing the benefits of Big Data will require a new generation of leaders in (bio)statistical and computational methods who will be able to develop the approaches and tools necessary to unlock the information contained in large heterogeneous datasets. There is a great need for scientists trained in this specialized, highly heterogeneous, and interdisciplinary new field of health big data. Thus, the recruitment of talented undergraduates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) programs is vital to our ability to tap into the potential that `Big Data' offers and the challenges that it presents. The University of Michigan Undergraduate Summer Institute: Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data will primarily draw from the expertise and experience of faculty from three different departments within three different schools at the University of Michigan: Biostatistics in the School of Public Health, Computer Science in the School of Engineering, Statistics in the College of Literature, Sciences and the Arts. The faculty instructors and mentors have backgrounds in Statistics, Computer Science, Information Science, Medicine, Population Health, Social and Biological Sciences. They have active research programs in a broad spectrum of methodological areas including statistical modeling, data mining, natural language processing, statistical and machine learning, large-scale optimization, matrix computation, medical computing, health informatics, high- dimensional statistics, distributed computing, missing data, causal inference, data management and integration, signal processing and medical imaging. The diseases and conditions they study include obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, neurological disease, kidney disease, injury, macular degeneration and Alzheimer's disease. The areas of biology include neuroscience, genetics, genomics, metabolomics, epigenetics and socio-behavioral science. Undergraduate trainees selected will have strong quantitative skills and a background in STEM. The summer institute will consist of a combination of coursework, to raise the skills and interests of the participants to a sufficient level to consider pursuing graduate studies in `Big Data' science, along with an in depth mentoring component that will allow the participants to research a specific topic/project utilizing `Big Data'. We have witnessed tremendous enthusiasm and success with the current summer program on Big Data led by this team with 164 students trained in the last 4 years (2015-2018) including 90 female students and 30 students from underrepresented minority groups. Fourteen of these participants from the last three years are currently graduate students in Michigan Biostatistics. The ongoing program has gained traction in the national landscape of summer research programs with 20% rate of admission and 80% rate of acceptance among those who are offered this opportunity. The program has consistently received very strong evaluation and our past alumni have become brand ambassadors and advocates for our program. We plan to build on the success and legacy of this program in the next three year funding cycle of this grant (2019-2021). The overarching goal of our summer institute in big data is to recruit and train the next generation of big data scientists using a non-traditional, action-based learning paradigm. This six week long summer institute will recruit a group of approximately 45 undergraduates nationally and internationally, with 20 domestic students supported by the requested SIBS funding mechanism and others supported by supplementary institutional and foundation support. We propose to expose the trainees to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of health Big Data. They will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research. They will engage in mentored research projects in three primary areas of health big data: Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. Some of the projects will be defined in the area of cardiovascular precision medicine, defined by a team of highly quantitative researchers engaged in cardiovascular research that uses big data. At the conclusion of the program there will be a concluding capstone symposium showcasing the research of the students via poster and oral presentation. There will be lectures by U-M researchers, outside guests and a professional development workshop to prepare the students for graduate school. We propose an inter-SIBS collaboration with Dordt College summer program trainees who will attend this concluding symposium. The resources developed for the summer institute, including lectures, assignments, projects, template codes and datasets will be freely available through a wiki page so that this format can be replicated anywhere in the world. This democratic dissemination plan will lead to access of teaching and training material for undergraduate students in this new field across the world. We will offer multiple professional development opportunities and resources for graduate school preparation to our trainees so that they can reflect and plan beyond their senior year. All of our proposed activities are reflected through our three specific aims: Teaching, Mentoring and Dissemination. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose a six week long undergraduate summer institute: “Transforming Analytical Learning in the Era of Big Data” to be held at the Department of Biostatistics, University of Michigan (U-M), Ann Arbor, with a group of approximately 45 undergraduate students recruited nationally and internationally, from 2019-2021. Funding is requested for 20 domestic students with supplementary funding expected to be garnered through institutional resources and private foundation support. The program builds on the success of our existing Big Data Summer Institute (BDSI) supported by a NIH BD2K Courses and Skills grant award that is ending in 2018. We plan to expose program students to diverse techniques, skills and problems in the field of Big Data and Human Health. We enhance our ongoing summer program structure in the current proposal by involving a team of researchers working at the intersection of cardiovascular research and data science with a focus on cardiovascular precision medicine where some of the new mentored research projects will be defined. We primarily focus on three genres of health Big Data arising in Electronic Health Records/Medical Claims, Genomics and Imaging. The trainees will be taught and mentored by a team of interdisciplinary faculty from Biostatistics, Computational Medicine and Bioinformatics, Statistics, Computer Science and Engineering, Information Sciences, Epidemiology and Medicine, reflecting the shared intellectual landscape needed for Big Data research.

"Statistical Methods for Ultrahigh-dimensional Biomedical Data This proposal develops novel statistics and machine learning methods for distributed analysis of big data in biomedical studies and precision medicine and for selecting a small group of molecules that are associated with biological and clinical outcomes from high-throughput data such as microarray, proteomic, and next generation sequence from biomedical research, especially for autism studies and Alzheimer’s disease research. It focuses on developing efficient distributed statistical methods for Big Data computing, storage, and communication, and for solving distributed health data collected at different locations that are hard to aggregate in meta-analysis due to privacy and ownership concerns. It develops both computationally and statistically efficient methods and valid statistical tools for exploring heterogeneity of big data in precision medicine, for studying associations of genomics and genetic information with clinical and biological outcomes, and for feature selection and model building in presence of errors-in- variables, endogeneity, and heavy-tail error distributions, and for predicting clinical outcomes and understanding molecular mechanisms. It introduces more robust and powerful statistical tests for selection of significant genes, SNPs, and proteins in presence of dependence of data, valid control of false discovery rate for dependent test statistics, and evaluation of treatment effects on a group of molecules. The strength and weakness of each proposed method will be critically analyzed via theoretical investigations and simulation studies. Related software will be developed for free dissemination. Data sets from ongoing autism research, Alzheimer’s disease, and other biomedical studies will be analyzed by using the newly developed methods and the results will be further biologically confirmed and investigated. The research findings will have strong impact on statistical analysis of high throughput big data for biomedical research and on understanding heterogeneity for precision medicine and molecular mechanisms of autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and other diseases. This proposal develops novel statistical machine learning methods and bioinformatic tools for finding genes, proteins, and SNPs that are associated with clinical outcomes and discovering heterogeneity for precision medicine.
