"Computational Social Science Training Program Project Summary/Abstract The Computational Social Science Training Program (CSSTP) at UC Berkeley provides training in advanced analytics to predoctoral students in the social and behavioral sciences studying health topics covered by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child and Human Development. CSSTP is a new program that combines Berkeley's long-standing strength in quantitative social and behavioral science with its nationally- recognized campus programs in data science education, practice, and research. It will serve five entering trainees per year over five years. The training faculty includes 22 social scientists who have exemplary records of developing and applying novel statistical methods to health-related social/behavioral science problems, as well as 13 data scientists who are leading figures in the foundations of mathematics, statistics/biostatistics, and computer science. Trainees, who will be drawn from a diverse pool of students in six social science doctoral programs, are provided with a rigorous and tailored program designed to teach a team science-based approach to problem solving and to emphasize the analysis of intensive or voluminous longitudinal data and high-density, large sample or population level agency databases. Each trainee is supported by a dual-preceptor model in which s/he is provided with a social sciences faculty mentor and a data science mentor who help to facilitate the trainee's progress through the program. CSSTP trainees are provided with community space at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science (BIDS), a dynamic multi-disciplinary data science research center, where trainees work alongside other data science fellows in residence. After completing their first-year course requirements in their home departments, trainees formally enter the program in their second year of graduate school, devise an individual development plan, and take a core two-semester course in computational social science, team-taught by training faculty. This course introduces students to essential data science methods and tools, including Python programming, data management, natural language processing, machine learning, causal inference, and responsible conduct and reproducibility of research, through lectures, in-depth discussion of social science applications, and small group learning exercises. In the following year, students apply these skills through placements on collaborative health-related research teams or labs on campus and/or with external industry partners, thus developing skills in advanced analytics through research practice involving the development and implementation of new methods. Additional training tailored to student needs and interests is provided through elective courses, a weekly computational social science workshop series, and ongoing working groups at the Berkeley Institute for Data Science and the Social Science D-Lab, a campus hub for data science training and research for social scientists. CSSTPs benefits will ripple out to the greater campus and beyond by stimulating new faculty collaborations and by creating a critical mass of rigorously trained computational social science students who will be competitive and qualified for jobs in rapidly changing and evolving data intensive fields. PROJECT NARRATIVE Advanced data analytics is transforming social and behavioral science research on medicine and health. This training program in Computational Social Science will equip a diverse cadre of social and behavioral science health investigators to conduct novel research using advanced computational and statistical methods, preparing them for transdisciplinary careers in data analytics. All aspects of the training will emphasize rigor in research and reproducibility of research results.",Computational Social Science Training Program,10142523,T32HD101364,"['Social Sciences', 'Training Programs']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,T32,2021,233014
"NRSA Training This revised CTSA Institutional Training Core (TL1) has been designed to leverage the strengths of The New Jersey Alliance for Clinical and Translational Science (NJ ACTS), the umbrella organization that will provide an infrastructure to support and enhance clinical and translational research and training in New Jersey. Led by Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences (RBHS) and administered by the Rutgers Institute for Translational Medicine and Science (RITMS), NJ ACTS comprises an Alliance of three universities (Rutgers University, Princeton University, and the New Jersey Institute of Technology) and community-based organizations, hospitals, community health centers, outpatient practices, data centers and two Health Information Exchanges. This unique and dynamic environment will allow us to create a robust and effective platform to train the next generation of translational researchers. Innovative translational research can neither be taught nor accomplished in a silo. We want to encourage our trainees to consider, from the earliest stages of their doctoral experience, the implication and application of their research efforts to the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease. To accomplish this, rather than limit our training within a particular department or program, we have gathered an initial cohort of highly productive mentors with proven expertise in basic biomedical and bioengineering research, clinical research, bioinformatics, biostatistics, machine learning, epidemiology, health policy and other key areas that will coalesce to provide mentorship to our trainees. Our cross-disciplinary team has been united as the “NJ ACTS Academy of Mentors” which will be the educational platform for this TL1 training effort. To enhance the translational nature of this experience, the Academy of Mentors will be shared by both our NJ ACTS Trainees (TL1) and Scholars (KL2). Strategically, we will focus on a trainee pool composed of students who have expressed, by choice of degree(s) and/or graduate program, an interest in translating basic science findings and concepts into disease-relevant applications (MD/PhD. PharmD/PhD, DPT/PhD, Biotechnology, Biomedical Engineering and Psychiatry PhD). With the help of the program leadership and their mentoring team, each trainee will design a curriculum of core and elective courses, workshops, seminars and immersion experiences, to achieve “precision” training tailored to their needs and research career aspirations. Further, we will systematically assess our programmatic outcomes using valid and reliable metrics within the context of an internal and external evaluation team. n/a",NRSA Training,10115155,TL1TR003019,"['Academy', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Biometry', 'Biotechnology', 'Career Choice', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communities', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Pharmacy', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Educational workshop', 'Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Evaluation', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Sciences', 'Hospitals', 'Immersion', 'Infrastructure', 'Institutes', 'Leadership', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'National Research Service Awards', 'Nature', 'Neighborhood Health Center', 'New Jersey', 'Outcome', 'Outpatients', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Students', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Universities', 'base', 'cohort', 'data centers', 'design', 'disorder prevention', 'experience', 'innovation', 'interest', 'next generation', 'programs', 'translational medicine', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,RUTGERS BIOMEDICAL/HEALTH SCIENCES-RBHS,TL1,2021,377615

"Education Pathways for Biomedical Data Science (R25) Project Summary / Abstract This project brings together Drexel University and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) to create an adaptive Biomedical Data Science education program to empower researchers to learn and use emerging data science methods. We propose an in-line program to prepare researchers for data-driven work directly in their current field, while also identifying avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration. We will develop novel curricula pathways, leverage existing educational resources, create bridge materials, and provide practicum “lab” activities matching domain-specific projects to participants for hands-on experience. Educational Pathways in Biomedical Data Science will collaborate with the CHOP Office of Academic Training and Outreach Programs to engage a diverse learner audience in novel pedagogical research. Learners will be recruited from active participants in many existing CHOP training initiatives, including a novel data science education program, graduate student training, postdoc mentorship, physician fellowship research, and clinical research staff training. After enrollment, education program managers will cluster participants into collaborative communities of practice where they will receive mentorship and contribute to development of pathways. We acknowledge that we are still learning the most effective interventions for biomedical data science education, both within our specific communities and broadly within medical education (e.g. Federer et al., 2015; Rowhani-Faarid, Allen, and Barnett, 2017). We will develop new evidence of gaps in knowledge, skills, and attitudes among learners. We will develop and implement biomedical data science literacy instruments based on emerging scholarship. We will also gather learner feedback via mixed methods to adapt and evolve our modular resources, ensure robust learner outcomes, and align deliverables with the NIH Strategic Plan for Data Science. Data Science instruction for researchers outside of traditional computer and information sciences is a concrete step toward data-driven scientific literacy for all. We will ensure that participants emerge from this program with computational and algorithmic literacy solidified through hands-on experience. For non-computing researchers, we also will provide the foundational data fluencies necessary for individuals to contribute meaningfully to machine learning research, which will enable data-driven systems, insight-to-decision transformation, decision- making, and data-driven decision management. Finally, for all participants, we will strive to help individuals from a broad spectrum of backgrounds and identities identify new directions in which to develop their careers. Project Narrative “Educational Pathways in Biomedical Data Science” will create evidence-based pathways to guide and augment researcher skill in data-intensive science. Our learning pathways and supporting modules will equip researchers to perform nimble research with massive datasets that span institutional and disciplinary boundaries. We will model cross-disciplinary collaboration by building upon an existing partnership between the College of Computing and Informatics of Drexel University and the Research Institute of the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, grounding the project in both computing and biomedical research practice.",Education Pathways for Biomedical Data Science (R25),10199482,R25GM141501,"['Academic Training', 'Attitude', 'Biomedical Research', 'Certification', 'Clinical Research', 'Cloud Computing', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Community of Practice', 'Computational algorithm', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Decision Making', 'Degree program', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Effectiveness', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'Feedback', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Sciences', 'Instruction', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Education', 'Mentorship', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Peer Review', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Plant Roots', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Scholarship', 'Science', 'Strategic Planning', 'System', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'acronyms', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biomedical informatics', 'career', 'cohort', 'college', 'computer science', 'education pathway', 'education resources', 'effective intervention', 'evidence base', 'experience', 'formative assessment', 'graduate student', 'insight', 'instrument', 'interdisciplinary collaboration', 'interest', 'literacy', 'novel', 'online course', 'outreach program', 'pedagogy', 'programs', 'science education', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'student training', 'success', 'user centered design']",NIGMS,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,R25,2021,85673
"Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Science Institute (NUCATS) ABSTRACT: The health of children and adolescents is a critical determinant of our nation's health over the entire life course. Yet, research into child health lags behind that for adults. In part, this reflects historical, cultural and economic forces that tend to divert investigators into careers other than pediatric research. To address this concern, the Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute (NUCATS) chose the unique approach of specifically training young investigators to apply engineering solutions to problems in child health. Our overall goal is to generate a community of pediatricians, data scientists and engineers who collaborate across disciplines, using modern technology to improve the health of children and adolescents. The central focus of this continuing and highly successful effort is this Multidisciplinary Training Program in Child and Adolescent Health TL1, which has three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will train 10 postdoctoral fellows in basic science or pediatrics for two years, in a creative and multidisciplinary environment where investigators are equipped to apply innovative engineering approaches to problems in child and adolescent health. The fellows must have a mentor in both pediatrics and engineering. Presently, their projects range from computer-controlled delivery of general anesthesia or using nanotechnology to treat brain tumors, to applying machine learning to optimize discharge planning. This innovative research experience is complemented by mentoring from the TL1 leadership and from their postdoctoral-fellow peers; required foundational elements, which promote communication across traditionally disparate scientific disciplines; required selective components, assigned to individual fellows to optimize their training in pediatric clinical and translational science; and a menu of enrichment opportunities that are optional for each trainee. All of these components include both didactic and experiential approaches. In Aim 2, to expand the pipeline of engineers entering child and adolescent health research, we will provide 2, one-year positions (1 supported by the CTSA and 1 by institutional funds) for predoctoral engineers entering the last year of PhD training, especially those representing underrepresented minorities, as they complete their research and write their thesis. By including engineering trainees who are interested in CTS in the training activities available to our TL1 postdoctoral fellows, we intend to enhance their potential commitment to pediatric translational science. Finally, in Aim 3, we will provide a summer research experience at Northwestern for 4 students in clinical post-baccalaureate programs at a traditionally underrepresented-minority institution. Our experience to date suggests that, with our ongoing involvement after the summer experience, many of these students have been inspired to seek careers in translational research. Together, these aims outline a comprehensive and successful program to increase the number and quality of investigators applying innovative approaches to improving child and adolescent health. PROJECT NARRATIVE This proposal describes a plan to continue a novel program through which we will develop a community of researchers to apply engineering solutions to problems in child health. We will train clinical and basic science postdoctoral fellows with a common curriculum, so that they learn to work together to translate new technical advances into approaches to patient care. To expand the pipeline of trainees entering this field, we will also implement programs to attract predoctoral students and underrepresented-minority, masters-program students to child-health research.",Northwestern University Clinical and Translational Science Institute (NUCATS),10194632,TL1TR001423,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Basic Science', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Child Health', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computers', 'Data Engineering', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Discharge Plannings', 'Discipline', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Economics', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Elements', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'General Anesthesia', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Life Cycle Stages', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentors', 'Minority-Serving Institution', 'Modernization', 'Nanotechnology', 'Patient Care', 'Pediatric Research', 'Pediatrics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Students', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'Talents', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Translating', 'Translational Research', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'adolescent health', 'bridge program', 'career', 'experience', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'pediatrician', 'peer', 'post-doctoral training', 'pre-doctoral', 'programs', 'summer research', 'tool', 'translational health science']",NCATS,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,TL1,2021,706428
"Training in Multi-Modality Molecular and Transitional Cardiovascular Imaging This is the revision of a second competitive renewal of a currently funded T32 grant that received a very favorable initial review. This grant provides post-doctoral training in multi-disciplinary multi-modality molecular and translational cardiovascular imaging for highly qualified fellows holding either a MD or/and PhD, in preparation for academic careers as independent investigators in the highly clinically relevant field of cardiovascular imaging and image guided intervention. As imaging technology and molecular medicine advances, increasingly complex questions often arise requiring the convergence of perspectives from multiple disciplines. The future of cardiovascular imaging will most likely be practiced by integrated multidisciplinary teams with diverse areas of expertise. The goal of this research training program is to provide the necessary skills needed to work in this new multi-disciplinary investigative environment. Applicants will be recruited from both clinical and basic science departments, with attention paid to recruitment of female, minority, disabled, and disadvantaged candidates. We will continue to select and enroll applicants to maintain support for 6 post- doctoral fellows each year, with an equal balance of physicians and scientists. We have added a new pathway that focuses on image-guided therapy, and have expanded the image analysis pathway to include specific training in machine and deep learning provided by the recently established Translational Image Analysis and Machine Learning (TIAML) Center and partnering with data science center at the university. Post-doctoral fellowship training will be 2-3 years in duration. There will be four primary research focuses in the post-doctoral training, 1) cardiovascular molecular imaging, 2) cardiovascular imaging technologies and analyses, 3) image guided therapy, and 4) translational cardiovascular imaging. The primary faculty for this program are from the Department of Biomedical Engineering of the Yale School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and from multiple departments within the Yale School of Medicine, including: Internal Medicine (Section of Cardiovascular Medicine), Radiology & Biomedical Imaging, and Surgery. The faculty sponsors have been selected based on extramural support, research productivity, and commitment to multi-disciplinary training. Each trainee will be assigned a primary preceptor in the basic sciences and engineering or clinical research and co-mentor with complementary expertise. Trainee progress will be monitored by individual mentors, the trainee’s advisory committee, and the Program Directors. Drs. Sinusas and Duncan will co-manage the program to assure a balanced and integrated experience in the relevant clinical and engineering sciences. We have also established a more formal relationship between our T32 training program and the Vascular Biology T32 training program within the section of Cardiovascular Medicine and will establish an annual research retreat with fellow presentations of research in progress. This retreat should help to better integrate basic, translational and clinical research within the Section of Cardiology and other participating departments. Cardiovascular disease remains the major cause of morbidity in the US with the cost of care exceeding $555 billion in 2015 and as such, there has been a shift in emphasis from treatment of disease to the prevention of disease. Prevention of cardiovascular disease necessitates early detection and risk stratification, which may be facilitated by molecular and other multimodality imaging approaches allowing for a more precise and personalized approach to the evaluation and management of cardiovascular disease. For molecular imaging to emerge as a routine part of clinical practice, appropriate education within the cardiovascular physician community and training of a new breed of physicians and scientists is needed.",Training in Multi-Modality Molecular and Transitional Cardiovascular Imaging,10270922,T32HL098069,"['Molecular', 'Training', 'cardiovascular imaging', 'multimodality']",NHLBI,YALE UNIVERSITY,T32,2021,469843
"Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health) PROJECT SUMMARY  To expand the kidney-related biomedical workforce and counter the increasing disparity between the growing prevalence of renal disease and the disproportionate level of trainees, researchers and practitioners in nephrology and kidney health, we developed the Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health). ADVANCE Kidney Health is an education- based, hands-on research, education and clinical experience that applies pillars of 1) science, medical and engineering education; 2) training in innovation, entrepreneurialism and scientific translation; 3) experiential learning, mentorship and clinical immersion; and 4) needs-based application and practical translation – all aimed at producing motivated, trained and committed biomedical trainees interested in renal health and science to advance the workforce and develop the new health-related therapies of the future. The program recruits undergraduate students from across 15 departments within the College of Engineering at the University of Arizona (UArizona) that include: Biomedical Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering. ADVANCE Kidney Health is structured to provide trainees a medical school experience for early-stage undergraduate learners geared to instill an understanding of renal anatomy and kidney function. The core structure accesses a clinical experience to instill a motivation to pursue kidney- related patient care and/or translational research and progresses to an already established innovation bootcamp that culminates in an interdisciplinary capstone that has doubled in size over 10 years and accesses by more than 450 captive engineering students. The program leverages new infrastructure in medical and engineering education along with transdisciplinary programs aimed at innovation, technology development and entrepreneurialism with 15 physician navigators in kidney health and 23 engineering and scientific mentors spanning renal physiology, biomedical engineering, optical sciences and machine learning. The result is an interrelated program that bridges renal medicine, engineering and product development to develop new pipelines and on-ramps to impact career decisions and grow the future kidney-related workforce. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The prevalence of end-stage renal failure (ESRD) has increased ~40% over 20 years, but the kidney-related biomedical workforce has been unable to keep pace. New pathways to a career in nephrology and kidney-related medicine and research are vitally needed that combine early and frequent experiential opportunities to engage in patient-oriented kidney care and contribute to innovative technologies that will one-day change how renal dysfunction is diagnosed and treated. ADVANCE Kidney Health responds to this need by assembling diverse mentors, interdisciplinary infrastructure and novel engineering technologies to impact career trajectories and develop the new technological cures of tomorrow.",Arizona Technology Development and Clinical Education Program for Students in Kidney Health (ADVANCE Kidney Health),10230895,R25DK128859,"['Active Learning', 'Acute Renal Failure with Renal Papillary Necrosis', 'Address', 'Anatomy', 'Arizona', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Businesses', 'COVID-19', 'Career Mobility', 'Caring', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Thinking', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Dialysis procedure', 'Disease', 'Education', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'End stage renal failure', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Health Technology', 'Hypertension', 'Immersion', 'Infrastructure', 'Internal Medicine', 'Internships', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Laws', 'Legal patent', 'Machine Learning', 'Mechanics', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Motivation', 'Nephrology', 'Optics', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Problem Solving', 'Ramp', 'Renal function', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Seeds', 'Solid', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Technology Transfer', 'Thinking', 'Time', 'Touch sensation', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Translations', 'United States', 'Universities', 'base', 'bridge program', 'cancer therapy', 'career', 'career development', 'career preparation', 'cohort', 'college', 'design', 'early experience', 'education research', 'experience', 'fascinate', 'graduate student', 'hands on research', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'interest', 'kidney dysfunction', 'medical schools', 'new technology', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'product development', 'programs', 'recruit', 'response', 'skills', 'summer research', 'technology development', 'undergraduate education', 'undergraduate student']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R25,2021,140400
"NRSA Training Core Contact PD/PI: Urban, Randall J. NRSA-Training-001 (207) J. NRSA Training Core (TL1) Project Summary The strategic objectives of our NRSA Training Core (TL1), which support the workforce development goals of our CTSA hub, are to provide “predoctoral students orientation to translational science and postdoctoral appointees advanced research training aligned with CTSA goals of advancing therapeutics (drugs, devices, and preventatives), clinical interventions, and behavioral modifications to improve health”. These objectives are being met by engaging trainees from diverse biomedical disciplines in an innovative, competency-based training program, centered on the authentic clinical and translational (C&T) research practices of our Multidisciplinary Translational Teams (MTTs). Existing curricula and training programs in the biomedical sciences at UTMB, as elsewhere, excel at developing an individual’s discipline-specific knowledge and technical skills, but are less adept at developing the core competencies needed to effectively participate in the interprofessional, multidisciplinary team-based research environment critical to translate scientific discoveries into improvements in human health. To address this gap, our Specific Aim is to produce highly skilled researchers who possess both an integrated knowledge of the human diseases that underlie their C&T research and learner-level appropriate competency in team management, leadership, conflict resolution and negotiations, interprofessional communication, stakeholder engagement, entrepreneurship, and the regulatory/ethical issues associated with human-subjects research and clinical trials. Since our program’s inception, trainees have engaged in a competency-based curriculum using the latest pedagogical approaches, active learning modalities, and authentic experiences. Our current TL1 curriculum includes: 1) the Interprofessional Translational Research Design (ITRD) Course, 2) a Team Leadership Workshop for predocs; 3) the Clinical Encounters course, and 4) dissertation/postdoctoral research projects co-mentored by both scientific and clinical experts. For this renewal application, we introduce several new training initiatives including: new courses in medical-/bio-informatics and machine learning, team science (e.g., TeamMAPPS) and community-engaged research, a bench-to-global health policy Vaccinology Track, and new opportunities for training in entrepreneurship. Training will continue to be personalize through reiterative use of the Individual Development Plan (IDP) by our trainees and mentors. In addition to tracking NCATS common metrics, the outcomes of our training on learner competency across multiple C&T research domains will be assessed using a robust set of rubrics and validated assessment tools. Results will continue to be disseminated to the education and research communities through, on-line course materials, publications, presentations and workshops. The need for well-trained C&T researchers with the knowledge and skills needed to advance new scientific discoveries into improvements in human health has never been greater. With further support from NIH/ NCATS for 6 full-time training slots (4 predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral) and 10 short-term positions annually, we will continue to prepare the biomedical workforce needed to solve the health care challenges of the 21st century.

"Advanced Graduate Training Program in Theoretical Neuroscience We are requesting the continuation of a training program in theoretical neuroscience with funds to support 4 predoctoral trainees. Our goal is to train students who combine exceptional skills in mathematics, statistics, modeling and machine learning with a deep understanding of neurobiology. The complexity of neural systems and of the data that we can now obtain demands researchers with these skills if we are to realize the neuroscience community's goals of achieving a mechanistic understanding of nervous system function and making significant progress in the treatment of neural disorders and mental illness. Training will occur at the Center for Theoretical Neuroscience at Columbia University, supported by the 6 faculty at the Center, faculty visitors to the Center, and 26 other faculty from the Departments of Neuroscience, Psychology, Biology, Biochemistry, Biomedical Engineering, and Statistics at Columbia. The Theory Center provides an exceptional environment in which pre-doctoral, post-doctoral and faculty researchers interact and collaborate extensively both within the Center and with researchers in experimental laboratories. Most trainees are members of the Columbia graduate program in Neurobiology and Behavior (with a small number drawn from other graduate programs) and take the courses that satisfy the requirements of that program. The required courses are augmented by a large selection of electives, including courses in theoretical neuroscience, statistics and machine learning. The goal of this training program is twofold: 1) To produce theoreticians who combine outstanding skills in analysis and model-building with a deep understanding and ""sense"" of biological neuroscience; and 2) To train experimentalist who are skilled at applying theoretical and computational methods in their research. This will be accomplished through extensive collaborations with outstanding experimental laboratories both at Columbia and elsewhere combined with training in state-of-the art theoretical methods. Whenever possible, students will be co-advised by both a member of the Theory Center faculty and a researcher from our associated experimental faculty, and they will be given desk space both in the Theory Center and in the laboratory of their experimental co-advisor. The opportunity to be involved in the operations of an outstanding laboratory and in the activities and intellectual atmosphere of a world-class theory center provides an exceptional training experience. The complexity of neuroscience data and the challenges of understanding and treating diseases and dysfunctions of the brain demand an unprecedented level of sophistication in data analysis and modeling. The proposed training program provides two solutions to this challenge: training theorists who combine technical expertise with a deep understanding of experimental neuroscience and of how to work with experimentalists; and training experimentalists who know how to apply theoretical methods and work with theorists. People with these combined skills will be essential for progress in neuroscience in the coming years.",Advanced Graduate Training Program in Theoretical Neuroscience,10168654,T32NS064929,"['Neurosciences', 'Training Programs']",NINDS,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,T32,2021,195916
"Training in Computational Neural Engineering The proposal initiates a new, innovative training program in Computational Neural Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory University to train the next generation of researchers at the intersection of computational neuroscience, data science, and clinical neurophysiology. It addresses the opportunities provided by the explosion of tools for measurement and manipulation of nervous system function and the challenges posed by the growing threat of neurological diseases and disorders on an expanding senior population. The program leverages past successes in federally-funded training efforts that have helped to catalyze rapid and recent growth in research and education in Computational Neural Engineering across Emory and Georgia. Early exposure to the intersection of fields is critical to the program mission. Interdisciplinary training in the first two years of the PhD program will provide trainees with unique opportunities for training across axes that span basic to clinical neuroscience, and from neural engineering to computational neuroscience, data science, and machine learning. Two graduate students per will be recruited from the applicant pools for the Biomedical Engineering (GT and Emory), Bioengineering (GT), Electrical and Computer Engineering (GT), and Machine Learning PhD programs, which collectively enroll over 200 PhD students per year. None of the participating programs offer research rotations or funding in the first year of graduate school. We will support a total of four students per year over a five-year period, providing two years of support for two entering students per year. funding such support will help attract the highest quality students to the program, and offer trainees the unique opportunity to rotate through research labs and establish new collaborative research projects. In our prior training experience, such interactions have led to new collaborations funded through fellowships and new research grants. Didactic training will complement core training in each PhD program with existing and new courses in computational neuroscience, neuropathology and neuroengineering, and a new course providing students with an immersive clinical experience at the Emory Brain Health Center. Extracurricular training includes Innovation Forums for clinician/engineering interactions, and a wide variety of seminars, methods clinics, and journal clubs. Trainees will also be provided with professional development for this new generation of researchers, including training in leadership, mentorship, neuroethics, and public scholarship. Trainees will also learn the growing industry in neural engineering, and will have opportunities for internships. Importantly, with solid preliminary evidence for the success in all of these ventures, this program targets an imperative area for growth. Our program will train the next generation of researchers to overcome challenges posed by the growing threat of neurological diseases and disorders on an expanding senior population. The training focuses on leveraging the explosion of new tools for understanding nervous system function in combination with a clinical understanding of neurological conditions and advanced methods in computation, data science, and machine learning. Trainees will tackle programs fundamental to advancing technology-based treatments for neurological diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and depression.",Training in Computational Neural Engineering,10220970,T32EB025816,"['Engineering', 'Training', 'relating to nervous system']",NIBIB,GEORGIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,T32,2021,188661
"Precision Health Intervention Methodology Training in Self-Management of Multiple Chronic Conditions Project Summary /Abstract:  The U.S. is undergoing rapid macrosocial transformations; the population is growing older and becoming more diverse. An aging population needs more care; the frequency and burden of multiple chronic conditions (MCC) are rapidly increasing. The recent health paradigm shift initiated by the Precision Medicine Initiative, along with significant advances in computational science, artificial intelligence, and mobile/wearable technology, now offers important opportunities to advance self-management science through the development of strategies tailored to the individual level. Based not only on genetics but also psychosocial phenotypic characteristics, the current pace of social and technological change demands a comprehensive, structured, transdisciplinary approach to self-management research training for the next generation of nurse scientists.  The University of Texas at Austin’s School of Nursing is uniquely positioned to foster future nurse scientists who can develop effective personalized interventions addressing the complex needs of self- management for people with MCC. Located at the “epicenter of the health technology hub” in Austin, Texas, within one of the most vibrant transdisciplinary health research environments in the nation, we are well positioned to train future scientists in precision health methodologies addressing MCC-focused self- management science. The school currently operates two strong centers for excellence focusing on transdisciplinary research in self-management and health promotion for underserved populations. We also have established collaborative agreements with four active T32 training programs (population science, interdisciplinary neuroscience, biomedical engineering and medical informatics, and big data science) at UT- Austin to facilitate high impact, transdisciplinary research training for all trainees in these four programs. To capitalize on our momentum of collaborative research and maximize our educational resources, we propose a new PhD training program (NIH T32) to provide future nurse scientists (13 pre-doctoral and 6 post-doctoral trainees over 5 years) with critical skills and knowledge to develop and implement innovative, effective and personalized interventions for populations suffering from MCCs.  The specific objectives of this transdisciplinary training program are: (1) To provide trainees with cutting edge knowledge and methods for constructing precise, personalized interventions for people with MCCs; (2) to utilize resources throughout our university and community to ensure training across disciplines to develop creative, successful clinical investigators who will make a major impact on advancing self- management science through precision health methodology; (3) to elevate the existing strengths of the university’s collegial, interactive, interdisciplinary research environment by creating a national model for training nurse scientists with precision health expertise. Managing multiple chronic illness is difficult task for everyone and often one size does not fit well. Given the rapid social and technological changes, a comprehensive, structured transdisciplinary approach to research training is becoming particularly important for preparing the next generation of nurse scientists. We propose to create a national model for training nurse scientists who will lead developing personalized intervention for people suffering multiple chronic conditions.",Precision Health Intervention Methodology Training in Self-Management of Multiple Chronic Conditions,10162669,T32NR019035,"['Intervention', 'Methodology', 'Precision Health', 'Self Management', 'Training', 'multiple chronic conditions']",NINR,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",T32,2021,209854
"Training in Complex Systems and Data Science Approaches Applied to the Neurobiology of Drug Use The purpose of this program is to train pre- and post-doctoral scholars in the application of complex systems and data science approaches to the neurobiology of substance abuse, with the dual strategies of: (1) training candidates with expertise in data science, applied mathematics, computer science, and complex systems to apply their skills to the neuroscience of addiction; and (2) training candidates pursuing addiction research from neuroscience, psychiatry, psychology and genetics in the theory and application of Big Data methods, including network analysis, machine learning algorithms, and Bayesian statistical models. Trainees will be paired across disciplines, and academic stages, for research collaboration and reciprocal tutoring to facilitate the development of proficiency in each trainee's new field. Each trainee will also be dual mentored, their secondary mentor being their partner's primary. Over its five-year duration, the program will provide three years of funding for each of five pairs of pre- and post-doctoral researchers, with an initial cohort of four (two pairs), and additional pairs entering in each of the middle three years. The core curriculum will incorporate: (1) the established complex systems and data science graduate certificate at the University of Vermont; (2) course work in neuroscience, psychology and addiction, including classes focused on developing human subjects research skills; as well as (3) specialized courses designed to directly and effectively bridge the gap between the core disciplines. Trainees will also attend a biweekly journal club and monthly seminar, led by senior participants in the program, to further support the acquisition of multidisciplinary research skills.  The overarching aim of the program is to produce researchers poised to apply state-of-the-art analytic tools to understand the neurobiology of drug abuse. The focus will be characterizing the neural substrates of addiction and other comorbid psychopathologies, always with an eye toward clinical application. Recent increases in the quantity and quality of large-sample, multi-modal datasets that address the neural, genetic and environmental substrates of addiction make this a propitious time for such a training program. Researchers at UVM are ideally suited to provide this training as there exist close links between addiction research, cognitive neuroscience, complex systems and data science, and the mentoring faculty have access to exceptional datasets that are ideal for interrogation with Big Data methods. Armed with coherent domain knowledge and practiced with advanced methods for complex systems, trainees will develop analysis pipelines that: (1) incorporate sophisticated aggregation of longitudinal and multi-modal datasets, including various neuroimaging modalities, genetic information, survey and clinical data; (2) harness the power of supercomputing and modern machine learning algorithms to step beyond linear and univariate effects; and (3) address questions of immediate clinical importance to substance abuse that can inform the determination of risk factors, treatment and intervention strategy, and policy decisions. The overarching aim of this training program is to produce substance abuse researchers well versed in the theory and application of state-of-the-art analytic tools for complex systems in the context of cognitive neuroscience broadly defined. The research focus is on characterizing the neural substrates of addiction, with natural extensions to the study of other psychopathologies, and all work undertaken will maintain an eye toward clinical application. Research results, methods and analysis pipelines developed by trainees and their mentors will be made publically available, and may inform the determination of risk factors, treatment and intervention strategy, and policy decisions made by public health professionals.!",Training in Complex Systems and Data Science Approaches Applied to the Neurobiology of Drug Use,10136564,T32DA043593,"['Complex', 'Data Science', 'Drug usage', 'Neurobiology', 'System', 'Training']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,T32,2021,262692

"Advanced Research Training in Communication Sciences and Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY This proposed renewal of Boston University's Training Program in Advanced Research Training in Communication Disorders and Sciences builds on the successful implementation of a multi- disciplinary, multi-institutional training effort. The current five-year cycle infuses a broad clinical perspective in trainees, incorporating didactic and research experiences across the full continuum of effective training in human health (i.e., from investigations of basic and disrupted mechanisms or communication processes, to treatment research, translation to the clinic, and broad implementation across health systems). Participating pre- and postdoctoral trainees have come from programs in Biomedical Engineering, Neuroscience, Psychological & Brain Sciences, and Speech, Language, & Hearing Sciences. The program is highly competitive at both the pre- and postdoctoral levels. The impact of this T32 is doubled at the predoctoral level by the commitment of each participating department to provide identical resources and opportunities for a “match” Communication Sciences & Disorders trainee for each T32-supported trainee. The next five-year cycle continues all of these successful components, and adds formal development for each trainee of a data sciences toolkit. New Key Personnel from Boston University's recently established Faculty of Computing and Data Sciences (see Biosketches for Azer Bestavros, Associate Provost for Computing and Data Sciences, and Director of the BU Data Science Initiative, as well as Eric Kolaczyk, Director of the Hariri Institute for Computing and Computational Science & Engineering) will provide curricular and research guidance for this aspect of the program. Required training in data sciences includes demonstrated facility by each trainee in math, statistics, data wrangling, data mechanics, and machine learning. Coursework may include data manipulation using Python, data science using R, and image analysis. The success of our trainees reflects the deep research and training resources of the inter- disciplinary and cross-institution partnerships comprising this program. Well-established laboratories guided by experienced and well-funded preceptors, with access to large, diverse patient populations are supported by experienced leaders and institutional commitment. This preparation and acculturation of talented trainees contributes substantially to our scientific and clinical capacity to understand, prevent, and remediate communication disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Disorders of human communication commonly occur after stroke or head injury, or may appear in early childhood in the form of delayed language development, acquired or congenital hearing impairment, or impaired speech. Reducing the disabling effects of communication disorders on people requires a specialized, highly trained research workforce, relying heavily on a coordinated effort to provide newly emerging scientists with a comprehensive clinical perspective and skillset.

"Data Science Training in Demography and Population Health Project Summary/Abstract The Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology (CSDE) at the University of Washington proposes a training program to create a new generation of population scientists and demographers equipped with skills to conduct data intensive research with advanced computational and statistical methods. Population science provides a crucial interdisciplinary framework for understanding the social, economic, political, and demographic dynamics affecting patterns of disease, mortality, fertility, and migration. But to extract signal from noise in the complex interplay of these processes the next generation requires training in state-of-the-art methods. The program will prepare trainees to be leaders in problems involving a wide range of complex data, including data arising from multiple sources, data not intended for research (e.g.administrative data), dynamic or spatial data, network data, and “big data'' sources. At the core of this program is a collaboration between CSDE, the eScience Institute (UW's data science center), and the Center for Statistics and the Social Sciences (CSSS). These three institutes combine extensive expertise in demographic methods, data science, computer science and statistical methods and have a long, successful record of collaboration on research and training activities, including a BD2K track in Big Data for Demographic Research. Through this collaboration, trainees will take a series of coursework in the following areas: advanced statistical methods and machine learning, coding, databases, data visualization/communication, and data ethics. Trainees will also take part in team-mentoring processes, where they develop an apprenticeship relationship with a primary mentor but also learn directly from other faculty and trainees through collaborative projects and seminars. Mentors will come from all three centers, along with a variety of additional departments, selected to provide the most relevant expertise, including multiple faculty from the highly-ranked departments of Biostatistics, Statistics and Computer Science & Engineering. Further, trainees will receive hands-on experience through rotations with on-campus and local partners.

"Advanced training in environmental health and data science: molecules to populations Project Summary Advanced training in environmental health and data science: molecules to populations. This application represents the consolidation of three NIEHS T32 training grants at Columbia University into a unified training program designed to address critical needs in the field of environmental health sciences. We propose a program with 18 predoctoral students and 8 postdoctoral scholars. Our mentoring team has substantial funding from NIEHS (>$13,000,000 per year) and other agencies (>$40,000,0000 per year) that provides a wealth of opportunities for original research by both pre- and postdoctoral trainees. Our predoctoral trainees will participate in: 1) a core curriculum in environmental health sciences (using a life course approach to study molecular mechanisms of disease, epidemiologic methods, health effects of climate change, and the exposome) 2) a core curriculum in data sciences, 3) specialized coursework to support dissertation research, 4) research rotations, 5) small interdisciplinary training groups, and 6) dissertation research. Although our trainees will continue to take traditional didactic coursework, the addition of small interdisciplinary training groups, workshops, and boot camps creates a facile platform that can rapidly evolve to enable student exposure to cutting-edge methods that address future needs in the field. Through a collaboration with the Columbia University Data Science Institute (DSI) we propose a highly innovative training program for our postdoctoral trainees. One of the leading data science programs in the world, the Columbia DSI will provide complementary training and support for our fellows, including participation in their existing data science postdoctoral fellows program based in computer science and engineering. Fellows will acquire advanced data science skills to complement their environmental health science research (the primary focus on their training). In their second year, these fellows will enhance their leadership skills by facilitating our workshops, bootcamps, and mini-courses (machine learning, data visualization, network science) for the predoctoral trainees. Thus, the postdoctoral trainees will acquire a skillset that prepares them to apply advanced data science approaches to environmental health in the laboratory and in the classroom. Moreover, each postdoctoral fellow will lead (with an assigned faculty mentor) a small interdisciplinary training group of predoctoral trainees, providing an ongoing forum for interaction and collaboration between the pre- and postdoctoral trainees and enhancing their skills in guiding team science. Project Narrative Columbia University proposes to consolidate their three NIEHS T32 training grants into a single, unified program.

"Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine The aim of our multidisciplinary institutional training program, based in the Schools of Medicine and Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania, is to train predoctoral engineering students and physician postdoctoral fellows in Neuroengineering and its clinical translation. Disorders of the nervous system, such as stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease, depression, dementia, and head trauma, constitute 35% of all disease and disability, and the burden is rising. There is an explosion of promising therapies for these disorders in new technologies to image, analyze, and modulate neural circuits, but translating these therapies from the laboratory to patients is a challenge. It requires talented engineers educated in clinical science and technically proficient physicians who speak the same language. Together these investigators must navigate a complex scientific, regulatory, and clinical landscape. Despite the huge demand, few formal, interdisciplinary Neuroengineering training programs exist.  Our program is shared by the Penn Schools of Medicine and Engineering focused on Neuroengineering and Clinical Translation and recruits from an excellent pool of ~60 MD fellows and 55-75 PhD students each year. Physician and Engineering trainees will together become fluent in cutting-edge technologies at the forefront of Neuroengineering, such as devices, neurostimulation, machine learning, algorithm development, cloud computing, nanotechnology and materials science. They will innovate new therapies for human disease and gain a thorough understanding of the clinical, regulatory, and developmental environments necessary to safely bring new technologies to patients. The program’s core is a group of collaborative, multidisciplinary faculty mentors in engineering and the clinical neurosciences.  In addition to dedicated neuroengineering research, our training program includes: (1) a longitudinal mentored clinical experience for PhD candidates, (2) engineering lab immersion and tutorial for MD postdoctoral fellows, (3) courses and seminars in Engineering, Neuroscience, Medicine and Statistics, (4) training in the proper conduct of research, (5) workshops on professional and career development, including scientific writing, oral presentations, and laboratory management, (6) new to the program will be a dedicated statistician and expert guest speakers leading intensive didactic seminars on quantitative tools and approaches, experimental design, and statistical methodology, and (7) all journal clubs, workshops and one-on-one mentoring will have time devoted to promoting quantitative literacy and thinking to address issues in research.  The program, unique at Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment, including a compact campus where robust centers for Engineering, Medicine, Neuroscience and Statistics all reside within two blocks of each other, united through Penn’s Center for Neuroengineering and Therapeutics. Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine Disorders of the nervous system represent one of the largest, fastest growing areas of medical need in the United States and the most promising therapies for these disorders are new technologies to image, analyze, and modulate activity in neural circuits. There is a great need for engineers educated in clinical neuroscience and physicians with technical backgrounds to train and work together, to effectively bring these critical technologies to patient care. The goal of this multidisciplinary program is to train pre-doctoral engineering students, and post-doctoral MD and MD-PhD fellows together in Neuroengineering research, to translate their work to clinical care, and ultimately improve the lives of individuals with brain and nervous system disorders.",Training Program in Neuroengineering and Medicine,10207789,T32NS091006,"['Medicine', 'Training Programs']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,T32,2021,459450
"UCSF Data Science Training to Advance Behavioral and Social Science Expertise for Health Research (DaTABASE) Program Summary Behavioral and social science researchers are essential for advancing research on reducing health disparities. The next generation of such researchers must be equipped with the most powerful, contemporary analytic tools. Newly available data and methods have the potential to transform the questions asked, the research designs used, and the statistical approaches applied to deepen our understanding of fundamental drivers of health and increase our capacity to improve population health and reduce disparities. To take advantage of these opportunities, we need researchers with interdisciplinary training that allows them to connect the traditional behavioral and social science expertise with the rapidly evolving technical repertoire of computational health scientists. The UCSF Data Science Training to Advance Behavioral and Social Science Expertise for Health Research (DaTABASE) program braids training strands previously operating independently within UCSF. Particular strengths of DaTABASE include: 1) Grounding in a rigorous, interdisciplinary quantitative training program for a foundation in study designs and statistical analyses to deliver actionable evidence on health; 2) Integration of multiple data streams, including: ‘omics, clinical (e.g., UC-wide, geolocated and longitudinal medical records, clickstream data from UCSF’s unique clinical informatics infrastructure), digital (device-based data flows, social media data, technology enabled cohorts), population (e.g., San Francisco Department of Public Health data linking health and social services provided to homeless individuals or other vulnerable populations) and policy data sets (e.g., local policies regulating cannabis retail outlets in California communities); 3) training and research activities organized around the elimination of health disparities. DaTABASE trainees will complete the rigorous methodological training for a PhD in Epidemiology and Translational Science. Additional content training, overseen by faculty in the UCSF Center for Health and Community, will provide theoretical frameworks and disciplinary background for social and behavioral sciences. Additional quantitative methods training will be delivered via the Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute (BCHSI). BCHSI emphasizes machine learning tools to mine data sources for novel insights and discovery, including precision medicine and population health. This training initiative will prepare graduates to apply those analytic tools to novel data sets for research on behavioral and social processes underlying health disparities. The DaTABASE program will provide intensive mentoring from both content and methods experts. DaTABASE alumni will be prepared to lead research addressing current and emerging public health challenges with innovative computational and data science analytic approaches. Narrative This UCSF training grant (DaTABASE) will provide training in advanced data analytics to predoctoral researchers studying behavioral and social determinants of health. The program is a collaboration between the UCSF Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Bakar Computational Health Sciences Institute, and the Center for Health and Community. Unique strengths of the program include 1) a focus on health disparities; 2) exceptional clinical and population data sources; and 3) integrating advanced machine learning methods into causal frameworks for actionable results.",UCSF Data Science Training to Advance Behavioral and Social Science Expertise for Health Research (DaTABASE) Program,10127700,T32MD015070,"['Data Science', 'Databases', 'Health', 'Research', 'Training', 'behavioral/social science', 'programs']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",T32,2021,209346
"Developmental Psychology Training Grant PROJECT SUMMARY: American youth are growing up in more contextually varied circumstances. These circumstances profoundly impact health and well-being, both positively and negatively across the life course. However, little is known about how economic, cultural, ethnic and family contexts become biologically embedded and how this interaction with biology during development influences trajectories of developmental and health outcomes. Part of the reason for the sparse knowledge is that few investigators have expertise in the three domains necessary to successfully grapple with these questions, namely, developmental science of context, human neurobiology, and advanced research methods. We propose a training program that will help fill this gap. The objective is to train an outstanding cohort of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows on 3 pillars of knowledge: (1) developmental science of context; (2) human neurobiology, including brain development, genomics, and endocrine function; and (3) advanced research methods (e.g., predictive analytics, machine learning, comparative approaches). This cross-training, which is predicated on an understanding of basic developmental processes, will produce researchers well positioned to conduct cutting- edge research that advances knowledge about how neurobiological factors interact with contexts to influence development across multiple domains. Those who receive this training will meet the growing demand for developmental scientists who integrate neuroscience perspectives and methods into their programs of research and possess the requisite skills for successful, collaborative, interdisciplinary work at the interface of neurobiology, context, and behavioral development. The demand for this expertise is strong and predicted to grow for years to come, given the paucity of individuals with the interdisciplinary training and the exciting recent advances in our understanding of the role of neurobiology in psychological development. We request funds to support 4 advanced predoctoral and 2 postdoctoral trainees each year. Trainees will engage in a 2-year series of courses and direct mentor-based research training that will allow them to integrate work on context, human neurobiology, and advanced methodology. Each trainee will have three mentors, covering (1) development of context, (2) human neurobiology, and (3) advanced methodology. The training program will be housed in the Developmental Area (within the Department of Psychology), which has 22 participating faculty members. An additional strength is that the training grant includes 13 faculty members from other units including Human Genetics, Biopsychology, Cognition and Cognitive Neuroscience, Linguistics, Pediatrics, and Psychiatry. The training will draw on the rich resources of the University of Michigan, including extensive training in integrative research, and courses in advanced methodology/statistics. The training program will prepare predoctoral and postdoctoral students to bridge research in the developmental science of context and human neurobiology in order to determine how the social environment interacts with genetics and the brain to guide development. PROJECT NARRATIVE American youth are growing up in more contextually varied circumstances. While it is established that these circumstances profoundly impact development, little is known about how they become biologically embedded and how this interaction with biology influences trajectories of developmental and health outcomes.

"Training in Child Health Services Research and Implementation Science This renewal application builds on the expertise of an experienced and dedicated faculty with a 23-year history of leading successful AHRQ-funded, post-doctoral NRSA training programs focused specifically on pediatric health services research. In an increasingly dynamic US health care system, meeting the needs of children will require health services researchers to be trained in novel and wide-ranging methods to study and improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of health care. Through expanding faculty and partnerships, our program stands ready to meet the needs of our trainees to tackle health services research that builds on advances in science, technology, and data analytics, including genomics; data mining and machine learning; novel diagnostics and therapeutics; and information technology. In this renewal, we will continue the core programmatic collaborations among Boston Children's Hospital, the MassGeneral Hospital for Children, and the Department of Population Medicine at Harvard Medical School as well as the successful engagement of our newest partner—the Institute for Healthcare Improvement—which has brought its recognized expertise in care improvement and implementation science to our trainees through curricular enhancements and research opportunities. As both the development of research and its implementation are increasingly informed by patients and the patient experience, our program will continue to engage patients and parents to provide substantive feedback on trainees' current and future research, as an integral aspect of our program's culture. For this renewal, we will also engage with new partners to address the expanding role of information technology in healthcare. Our program will focus on four pillars of training: 1) cutting edge observational methods to learn from health and health system data; 2) application of implementation science and related methods to improve the design, delivery, and evaluation of care for children across a variety of financing and delivery systems; 3) incorporating the perspective of patients and families into the process for designing and conducting research; and 4) framing research in children as a part of health over the life course, especially the pervasive, enduring impact of disparities in care and services. The program will support 6 stipends per year (3 first-year and 3 second-year continuing postdoctoral fellows) to create a critical mass of trainees across subspecialties, areas of research, and methodological domains. In addition to conducting closely mentored research, each trainee will complete the requirements of an MPH from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health for core skills of biostatistics and epidemiology, and participate in advanced health services research methods training. Our well-developed program infrastructure and system for close monitoring of trainees' progress will ensure the continuation of our record of graduating individuals who will lead relevant, applied health services research that translates into both improved care and health outcomes for all children. The proposed renewal will continue our successful program to train child health researchers to conduct meaningful research leading to improvements in health care delivery for children. The program will include training in the established building blocks of health services research (epidemiology, statistics, and study design) as well as methods of improvement and implementation science. Trainees will be equipped to engage with the evolving US healthcare system, focusing on research that reduces health and health care disparities, is informed by the patient perspective, and is ready for integration into clinical delivery systems. Our graduates will help to transform the current health care system to be more efficient, effective, and patient and family-centered for all children.",Training in Child Health Services Research and Implementation Science,10191035,T32HS000063,[' '],AHRQ,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,T32,2021,545071
"Training Program for Interactionist Cognitive Neuroscience (ICoN) Our training program for Interactionist Cognitive Neuroscience (ICoN) seeks to provide student-focused, interdisciplinary training in computational cognitive neuroscience that integrates data from multiple scales and levels of analysis. Transformative gains in understanding the human brain and mental health require integration across multiple levels of analysis. Recent historic advances in genetics and cellular biology are paving the way for understanding fundamentals of neural function. At the other end of the spectrum, methods for imaging and stimulating human brains non-invasively have led to revolutionary advances in discovering the macro-scale organization supporting perception, motivation, and cognition. Now, a major effort at the `systems' level between these two scales is beginning to uncover the activity, connectivity, and computations of neural circuits. The advent of this systems-level progress holds the promise of linking core circuit computations to emergent human behavior and leading to detailed, transdiagnostic models of mental illness. However, as we recently argued (Badre, Frank and Moore, 2015 Neuron), fulfilling this promise requires making direct links between circuit-level computation and the emergent function of the human system. We believe that integrating systems- and human neuroscience in this way demands a systematic approach built on two key strategies. First, formal computational models must be used to provide principled links between levels of analysis; and, second, complementary methods must be applied, and in the ideal case parallel human and non-human studies conducted in coordination. Achieving these aims requires a new generation of scientists that can take full advantage of multiple techniques and data sources, and who are deeply versed in computational theory. Traditional neuroscience training relies on an apprenticeship model that limits students to a single lab and level of inquiry. Thus, a specialized training program is required to specifically equip neuroscientists for this `Interactionist' approach. ICoN will provide this training emphasizing the two tenets: I. Computation is key to translating between levels. Students must be rigorously quantitatively trained in formal theory. A close corollary is that they must be fluent in the advanced analysis methods necessary for cross-level integration (e.g., machine learning). II. Next-generation scholars must have expertise at multiple levels. Students must be trained to use and integrate multiple methods and data sources. Further, they must have the skills (and courage) to pursue ideas to their next most logical step, to be question driven and not technique limited. Students will be trained to conduct integrative research projects across domains such as human cognitive neuroscience, systems neuroscience, and computational neuroscience. Project Narrative This is an interdisciplinary predoctoral program in computational cognitive neuroscience. Funds from this program will support the training of advanced predoctoral candidates who are capable of applying a combination of empirical and theoretical approaches that decisively addresses their scientific questions about the mind and brain. Training a generation of such scientists holds great promise for making transformative gains in our understanding of mental health and brain diseases and disorders.",Training Program for Interactionist Cognitive Neuroscience (ICoN),10161832,T32MH115895,"['Training Programs', 'cognitive neuroscience']",NIMH,BROWN UNIVERSITY,T32,2021,228070
"Integrated Biostatistical Training for CVD Research Project Title: Integrated Biostatistical Training for CVD Research PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This application proposes renewal of a novel, integrated program for predoctoral training in biostatistics focused on preparing trainees for careers in cardiovascular disease research. The escalating demand for skilled biostatisticians equipped to address ongoing and emerging challenges in this exciting era of cardiovascular disease research calls for training that formally integrates deep and sustained experience in collaboration in a multidisciplinary environment, mastery of the theoretical underpinnings of statistics required for valid application of sophisticated biostatistical techniques and for research on development of new methodology, and strong emphasis on communication and leadership skills. The program will be a joint effort of the Department of Statistics at North Carolina State University (NCSU), the Duke University Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics (B&B), and the Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI). It capitalizes on the long-standing partnership between the two departments and a medical research institution that is the largest Academic Research Organization in the world, with internationally known researchers at the forefront of cardiovascular disease and related research. The five-year program will support five (5) trainee positions in the NCSU Department and one (1) position in Years 1 and 2 and two (2) in Years 3-5 in Duke B&B. In addition, NCSU, Duke, and DCRI will provide two, one, and two matching positions in each year, respectively. Trainees at each institution will pursue rigorous study of statistical theory, including probability, inference, linear and other statistical models, advanced probability, and advanced statistical inference; and of statistical methods, including clinical trials design/analysis, longitudinal data analysis, survival analysis, and cutting-edge topics, such as record linkage, machine learning, parallel computing relevant to biomedical Big Data. They will also receive training in fundamental aspects of biology and cardiovascular medicine as well as research responsibility and ethics; and extensive formal and experiential training in communication and leadership skills. Trainees will be introduced to DCRI cardiovascular disease research gradually and evolve to full collaborative apprenticeships in which they are integrated as functioning members of DCRI project teams. Through this apprenticeship and formal courses and seminars, trainees will develop considerable working knowledge of cardiovascular medicine that will position them to make immediate contributions to cardiovascular disease research upon completion of the program. Each trainee will be assigned an inter-institutional mentorship team comprising a biostatistician mentor at each of NCSU and B&B and a clinician mentor whose primary affiliation is at DCRI, which will collaborate in guiding them through all aspects. Dissertation research will involve development and evaluation of novel statistical methodology inspired by challenges encountered in trainees' collaborations. Trainees will benefit from exposure to different cultures across both institutions, broadening their perspectives and access to courses, seminars, and other resources. !

"Tissue microenvironment (TIMe) training program Project Summary/Abstract A quantitative understanding of the tissue microenvironment (TiMe) is critical for advancing biomedical knowledge and healthcare, ranging from regenerative medicine to managing the burden of cancer. To train productive scientific leaders, education in three technological areas is essential: (a) sensing and imaging to measure biochemical and biophysical properties, (b) bioengineering to recapitulate the TiMe, and (c) computational modeling and analytics to gain insight. Accordingly, we propose to continue the TiMe training program wherein predoctoral students integrate the three technological approaches with TiMe-related biological contexts of disease and development to launch successful research careers. Training includes four core components—Curricular Activities to ensure technical depth and critical thinking with apposite breadth across disciplines, Extracurricular Activities to develop pragmatic skills, Professional Development to empower trainees to become research leaders, and Career Development to position trainees to make lifelong contributions to society. The activities are structured to streamline education and efficient focus on research with the awarded doctoral degree to include a special designation (concentration in TiMe). This past project period was our first and progress was made in establishing the program, its activities and evaluation to refine it further. Building upon the success of trainees (all ten graduated are in biomedical research careers, ~5.5. papers per trainee, and significant follow-on funding and awards), we propose to continue student development activities, add a novel hands-on education component based on a newly constructed laboratory and emphasize emerging scientific topics including machine learning and design thinking. Illinois has exceptionally strong disciplinary programs, diverse faculty spanning the program, appropriate facilities and unique resources in each of these technological areas. The TiMe Training Program is distinctly advantaged by our strong history of successful graduate training, including a commitment to diversity and individuals with disabilities, a culture of productive collaboration, a new Department of Bioengineering, and strong institutional support (matching direct support - $1.5 M and $2.9 M of total support). Forty faculty will serve as faculty mentors and another four, with expertise in pedagogy, evaluation and professional development, provide critical resources for the program. We propose to educate at least twelve trainees (six from NIH support and six matching slots from Institutional support) for up to two years each. Six trainees will be appointed annually from a strong applicant pool across campus. Traditional education will further be enhanced by co-mentored research with possibilities of translational opportunities via a new engineering- based College of Medicine. Outcomes will be rigorously evaluated throughout the program to improve training, to guide administrative decision-making and to disseminate best practices. The vision, expertise, and infrastructure of the Illinois TiMe Training Program will ensure that trainees selected from a strong and diverse graduate community will provide sustained research contributions to benefit public health.

"Training for Transformative Discovery in Psychiatry This proposal requests support for continuation of T32 MH16804, “Training for Transformative Discovery in Psychiatry” (Years 41-45), and an increase from 4 to 5 postdoctoral slots. T32 MH16804 trains MD, MD/PhD, and PhD scientists to conduct translational neuroscience research utilizing recent advances in our understanding of brain development and function with the goal of generating discoveries of novel mechanisms, and ultimately treatments, for mental illness. T32 MH16804 has been highly successful in achieving these goals as assessed by a number of metrics: 1) high rates of success for trainees in obtaining external funding, faculty appointments, or other research-intensive positions; 2) high quality and impact of trainee publications; 3) effective recruitment of a highly qualified and diverse set of translational neuroscience trainees, including from under-represented minority groups; 4) recruitment of MD/PhD trainees; 5) recruitment of female trainees. T32 MH16804 is led by Robert A. Sweet, MD, a senior translational neuroscience investigator with a record of outstanding mentorship and by Co-Director, Mary L. Phillips, MD, MD (Cantab), an acclaimed investigator and mentor in neuroimaging. Trainees participate in a program of mentored research, seminars, and practicums designed to train them in techniques and strategies such that their resulting research can be translated across multiple levels of discovery. All trainees benefit from the development of individualized training plans and from participation in our highly successful Career and Research Development seminar. During Years 41-45, we have made several additions with the goal of further improving trainee outcomes. We have added new faculty who use cutting edge translational neuroscience methods. We have developed a new seminar series to provide trainees an introduction to next-generation analytic methods such as computational modeling, integrative omics, and machine learning. We provide a new plan for instruction in methods for enhancing reproducibility. We have expanded the role of the Training Committee in monitoring trainee progress, increased the frequency of formal monitoring of trainee progress, and established an External Advisory Committee. Finally, we have developed additional approaches to further enhance recruitment of trainees from URM groups and those with disabilities. With a >7-fold excess of highly qualified, eligible applicants for available slots, T32 MH16804 can support the requested expansion to 5 slots, increasing the positions available to high priority groups (e.g. those from under-represented minorities or with MD/PhD training) that we have been successful in recruiting. Increasing to five slots will also provide an optional 3rd year for trainees who need longer to transition to independence. With these changes, T32 MH16804 will be poised to further impact the field by preparing an expanded cohort of translational neuroscientists to make transformative discoveries in psychiatry.

"Physics and Biology in Medicine Research Training Abstract: The specific aim of this training grant's competitive renewal proposal is to continue the development of research scientists that are well versed in physics, biology, mathematics, chemistry, engineering and computer science, who also understand the application of these disciplines to the detection, diagnosis and assessment of treatment of disease. While the focus of this training program is the UCLA Physics and Biology in Medicine (formerly Biomedical Physics) Interdepartmental Graduate Program, the training program is not limited to the traditional practice of Medical Physics and is much broader in scope. This training program has four tracks. The Medical Imaging track investigates the physics of diagnostic radiology modalities (e.g. MRI, MR Spectroscopy, CT) and Computer Vision methods to investigate areas such as quantitative imaging, imaging biomarkers and Radiomics (as well as correlation with genomic factors – Imaging Genomics) all of which seek to extract additional information from image data and relate it to other key information about patients and disease. The Molecular Imaging track investigates a wide range of topics including the physics of PET, optical and combined imaging modalities, immuno-PET, the chemistry and biology of novel imaging tracers, microfluidics, nanotechnology and others all focused on providing investigations of basic biological mechanisms, both normal and pathological. This includes investigations with applications in oncology (including responses to immunotherapies), traumatic brain injury, neurodegeneration and other conditions. The Molecular and Cellular Oncology track investigates the molecular, cellular, and tissue-related effects of radiation. This also includes a wide range of topics from Radiation Genomics (Radiogenomics) which explores genetic components of both radiation sensitivity and radiation resistance, the role of the immune system in response to radiation, cancer stem cells and radiation response as well as signal transduction pathways and their influence on radiation response. The Therapeutic Medical Physics track investigates novel approaches to treatment delivery systems including methods to improve the accuracy of treatment delivery such as breathing motion models for real time MRI guided treatment delivery to 4π treatment methods and brachytherapy. This program has been training primarily Ph.D. students for more than 60 years (40 years with this training grant), and is unique in that it brings together researchers from basic sciences with investigators in the clinical translational sciences and physicians who are truly clinical researchers, all in a common environment dedicated to bringing basic research to clinical applications. This program has the faculty, students, infrastructure and backing of its supporting Departments (Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, Radiological Sciences and Radiation Oncology) as well as the newly formed Graduate Programs in Biosciences to continue to achieve its goals of training the next generation of interdisciplinary scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE This training grant aims to continue to develop research scientists that are well versed in physics, biology, mathematics, chemistry, engineering and computer science, who also understand the application of these disciplines to the instruments and techniques used in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of disease as well as research fields that help us understand basic mechanisms of disease. These scientists will become actively involved in research into new methods that seek earlier diagnosis of disease as well as more specific (patient specific, disease specific) treatments of disease in many clinical applications.",Physics and Biology in Medicine Research Training,10216256,T32EB002101,"['Biology', 'Medicine', 'Physics', 'Research Training']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,T32,2021,259688
"An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning Abstract: The next generation of science and health care professionals will need to understand the foundational concepts of physics. While textbooks play a critical role in science learning, these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. Unfortunately, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current physical science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with interactive texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned force and motion (NGSS PS2A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing and developing science learning games (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content in both English and Spanish to address 9 additional NGSS standards (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive learning technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning disabilities. This Fast-Track project will produce a bilingual, digital platform to support students’ understanding of Physical Science, which will allow students to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages, play science learning games, and receive personalized content. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students, develop teacher support materials, and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform physical science learning",10303076,R44GM137622,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Books', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Drops', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Phase', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Scientist', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'bilingualism', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'efficacy evaluation', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'physical science', 'reading ability', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2021,774997

The program’s strategy allows national leaders with particular skills in the field to provide their knowledge to the participants and help mentor them through development of a relevant research question and identification of an appropriate and existing database(s) to address the question. With the guidance of a dedicated statistician and analyst programmer, participants will learn and perform the necessary computer programming needed to extract, clean and analyze these data. Participants whose projects involve the development of prediction models in the form of scores, nomograms or other tools will learn how to build and validate such tools in the existing project. Each participant’s project will culminate in the completion of a submitted manuscript to a peer- reviewed journal or study proposal and publicly available tools when relevant. Overall, the program will shape future scientific leaders in Urogynecology by encouraging the development of clinical-scientists and provide the skills and resources for invigorating data discovery and tools for investigations in HSR specifically addressing (PFDs). PROJECT NARRATIVE: The AUGS/DUKE UrogynCREST program will prepare participants to recognize the critical role that data play in delivering high quality health care for pelvic floor disorders.

"Reproducible and FAIR Bioinformatics Analysis of Omics Data PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Modern biomedical research is increasingly quantitative. The next generation of researchers will need an entirely new set of quantitative skills to fully take advantage of the data they create. In response to this need, the goal of the current R25 proposal is to transform an existing, 5-day bioinformatics techniques course into a new, two-week short course, Reproducible and FAIR Bioinformatics Analysis of Omics Data, to provide a unique educational opportunity for biomedical research scientists-in-training to begin to develop core competencies in bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of large datasets. The new course will also address NIH priorities including rigor and reproducibility and Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR) data principles. During the last five years, the Dartmouth faculty who are serving as Principal Investigators have taught a 5-day course at the MDI Biological Laboratory on bioinformatics and biostatistics to ~40 trainees/year (202 total). Based on overwhelmingly positive feedback, the current project will extend this 5-day course into a longer, two-week short course at the MDI Biological Laboratory that will feature a low student-to- instructor ratio (5:1), more hands-on experiential learning, and exceptional faculty who are highly experienced in teaching and performing big-data analyses. The new course is designed to accommodate ~35 trainees per year (175 total over the five-year R25 project). It will incorporate modules on biostatistics, scientific rigor and reproducibility, and FAIR data principles. The course design will also involve a short conceptual presentation, followed by an exercise in which students will gain confidence by applying a new skill. Each active-learning session will have three levels of difficulty (beginner, intermediate, and advanced) to allow each student to progress at their own pace. The low student-to-faculty ratio will allow course facilitators to guide participants through realistic challenges without causing frustration. The specific aims of the proposed course include: Specific Aim 1. Develop a two-week short course primarily for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students that improves their ability to design and analyze omics experiments such as RNA-seq, 16S (microbiome), metagenomics, and sc-RNA-seq data; Specific Aim 2. Enhance the impact of research by biomedical scientists by teaching them the Responsible Conduct of Research, the secure and ethical use of data, as well as rigor and reproducibility and FAIR data principles; Specific Aim 3. Disseminate the training curriculum to a broad audience; and Specific Aim 4. Evaluate the short- and long-term impacts of the course on students, including a long-term follow-up to determine students’ confidence in and actual integration of bioinformatics, biostatistics, and FAIR data principles into their research, and the reported impact of this course on their career trajectory and competitiveness in the job market. In summary, the proposed course will provide a unique cross- training, educational opportunity for biomedical research scientists-in-training to begin to develop core competency in bioinformatics and biostatistical analyses of large data sets.

"An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning Abstract: The next generation of health care professionals will need to understand the foundational principles of biology. Science textbooks play a critical role in supporting biological understanding in school, yet these books are not designed to meet the diverse learning needs of students in today’s classrooms. By their nature, science textbooks assume a one-size-fits-all approach to learning. Because of this problem, teachers spend substantial time outside of the classroom locating and adapting texts to support students who are learning English, students who read below grade level, and students with learning disabilities. The proposed Fast-Track project seeks to address the limitations of current Life Science textbooks and to revolutionize reading with adaptable texts. Transforming the learning process, SquidBooks makes texts flexible by offering digital texts at different difficulty levels with embedded language support to create a personalized reading experience, optimizing both learning and engagement. In particular, the project will support ELL students and students unable to read at their grade level. Because science textbooks are often written 3 to 5 years above the intended grade level, it is almost impossible for students with emerging and intermediate English reading skills to comprehend and learn from traditional science books. The Phase I project includes 3 aims: translating NGSS-aligned inheritance (NGSS LS3A) content into Spanish (Aim 1); designing, developing, and testing the application to function through a web browser (Aim 2); and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 3). The Phase II project will have 3 aims, including creating content to address 12 additional NGSS standards in English and Spanish (Aim 4); designing, developing, and testing improved software features (Aim 5); developing educator resources and conducting user testing with students and teachers (Aim 6). Successful completion of the proposed project will create knowledge about disciplinary textual processing and adaptive reading technologies and will support students who have historically been marginalized from STEM fields, especially students with low reading achievement and ELL students. In turn, this project will enhance and diversify the STEM and health care fields. Project Narrative: Although science textbooks are a central curricular resource in K-12 education, they are often inaccessible and difficult to read; this problem is compounded when students are unable to read at their grade level, are learning English, or have diagnosed learning needs. This Fast-Track project will produce an interactive, digital textbook to support students’ understanding of Life Science by giving them the ability to seamlessly move between different reading levels and languages and to play games that enhance their understanding of scientific language and concepts. This project will also solicit feedback from teachers and students to develop teacher support materials and evaluate the efficacy of SquidBooks at improving science learning outcomes.","An interactive, digital platform to transform biological learning",10083748,R44GM133245,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Biological', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biology', 'Books', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Diagnosis', 'Education Projects', 'English Learner', 'Feedback', 'Foundations', 'Future Teacher', 'Gametogenesis', 'Health Professional', 'Healthcare', 'Home environment', 'Individual', 'Internet', 'K-12 Education', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Middle School Student', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Process', 'Randomized', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Role', 'STEM field', 'Schools', 'Science', 'Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education', 'Spinal Cord', 'Students', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Textbooks', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Vocabulary', 'base', 'concept mapping', 'design', 'digital', 'education resources', 'efficacy evaluation', 'egg', 'eighth grade', 'experience', 'field study', 'flexibility', 'hands-on learning', 'improved', 'learning community', 'learning engagement', 'learning outcome', 'machine learning algorithm', 'next generation', 'personalized learning', 'reading ability', 'resource guides', 'response', 'science teacher', 'scientific literacy', 'skills', 'sperm cell', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'theories', 'tool', 'usability']",NIGMS,"SQUID BOOKS, LLC",R44,2021,750000

"Predoctoral Training Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Computational approaches based on statistical, mathematical and machine-learning principles are now permeating all areas of biological and biomedical research. Driving this explosion in biological computation are new high-throughput techniques in genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and chemoinformatics, and advances in modern imaging. Each of these fields generates complex data sets that require computational approaches to analyze and interpret. Also driving the use of computing in biomedical research is the increasing availability of high-performance computing, including graphical processing units (GPUs), that make deep learning and other artificial intelligence approaches computationally feasible. As a result, there is an increasing demand for biomedical researchers with expertise in scientific computing and data analytics and trained in statistical and mathematical modeling. To address this need, in 2007 the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill established the Ph.D. Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB).  The mission of the BCB curriculum is to train the next generation of scientists with the computational and quantitative skills required to make important contributions to modern biological and biomedical research. To accomplish this goal, not only requires students receive training in computational, mathematical and statistical approaches, but also that they become sufficiently versed in biology and acquire skills required for multidisciplinary team science. The BCB curriculum also strives to provide students with the professional skills required to successfully transition into careers in the biomedical workforce. The specific objects of the BCB curriculum are to: 1) provide broad knowledge of bioinformatics and computational biology approaches and the computational, statistical and mathematical foundations on which they are built, 2) provide in depth training in a chosen area of bioinformatics and computational biology, 3) train students to participate in collaborative and interdisciplinary research, 4) train students to develop independent research programs and identify new research directions, 5) develop skills in oral and written communication, 6) provide students with professional training opportunities for careers outside of academics and 7) provide students with training in the Responsible Conduct of Research, and in Rigor and Reproducibility.  The proposed T32 training program will support 6 BCB students during their second year of graduate training. In addition to providing didactic training and scientific research opportunities, the BCB curriculum provides professional training opportunities by sponsoring events such as “lunch and learn” sessions with representatives from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and “hackathons” with the National Center for Biotechnology Information. The University of North Carolina and BCB curriculum are committed to providing a supportive environment for students from all backgrounds and providing them with the training needed to successfully transitions to biomedical research careers in academic, governmental and corporate settings. Modern biomedical technologies, including rapid single-cell and whole tissue sequencing, high- content mass spectrometry, and modern imaging, are allowing systems-level analyses of complex diseases, such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Interpreting the large and complex data sets produced by these techniques requires use, and often development, of novel computational approaches. The Curriculum in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill provides the graduate training needed to develop and apply computational methods for biomedical research with the goal of developing novel therapeutic strategies for treating complex diseases.",Predoctoral Training Program in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology,10090190,T32GM135123,"['Bioinformatics', 'Computational Biology', 'Training Programs', 'pre-doctoral']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,T32,2021,243814
"Institutional Training Grant in Genomic Science Project Summary Abstract This proposal is for a renewal of NIH funding for Washington University’s Genome Analysis Training Program (GATP). The overall goal of the GATP is to train a diverse group of multidisciplinary, quantitatively sophisticated leaders in genomic technology, science, and medicine. In this renewal, we are focusing exclusively on training predoctoral students, because Washington University has an outstanding pool of highly talented PhD and MD/PhD students from which we can recruit the very best for the GATP. We are requesting funds to support 8 predoctoral trainees. If we are granted these slots the university will provide matching funds to support an additional 4 trainees. The GATP is designed to produce trainees who are sophisticated in their knowledge of both the experimental and the mathematical / computational aspects of genome science. This is achieved through a rigorous set of required classes and through research-based training. We have an outstanding group of 37 training faculty who run world-class research labs and provide careful mentoring to our trainees. Our PhD programs in Computational Biology and Genetics/Genomics were jointly ranked #1 in the nation in the 2018 US News & World Report analysis, tied with MIT and Stanford. We have made significant changes to our training program based on feedback from our trainees. Our trainees consistently express an interest in learning about career paths that utilize their skills. In response we have designed a set of mini-internship programs that take advantage of our connections to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, and to clinical genomics services. The opportunities are aimed at cultivating the leadership capability of our trainees and fostering a broad understanding of the different work environments and career paths in which genomics plays an important role. Many of our trainees are also interested in how machine learning is applied to problems in the genome sciences. As such we made changes to the GATP that ensure that all trainees are exposed to the foundational concepts underlying machine learning and artificial intelligence. We have also made changes to our evaluation protocols to make sure that we are meeting our goals in a way that is responsive to our trainees.

"Computationally Enabled Integrative Neuroscience Summary / Abstract ! The Brain and Cognitive Sciences (BCS) Graduate Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) proposes the “Computationally-Enabled Integrative Neuroscience” (CEIN) predoctoral training program. Tremendous advances in the field of neuroscience are beginning to enable an integrated understanding of the brain. A convergence of new tools and methods, from optogenetics to CLARITY to CRISPR to deep neural network modeling and machine learning, is providing the means to address problems that once seemed intractable. MIT's BCS department is ideally organized to promote interdisciplinary, integrative training and research in neuroscience and behavior, combining the empirical power of modern molecular, cellular, systems and behavioral methods, with the theoretical and model-building strength of computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. With world-renowned faculty and access to state-of-the-art equipment, CEIN trainees will be poised to lead the next generation of basic and translational neuroscience. The proposed CEIN training program maintains BCS's longstanding strength of integrative training across levels of empirical analysis. In addition, the proposed program reflects significant evolution in our field: the increased importance of computation in both data analysis and complex model building, and the increased importance of professional skills for leadership. The CEIN training objectives are focused on three training pillars (1) advancing empirical methods and concepts at multiple levels of neuroscience (2) computational approaches to theory development and brain data analysis, and (3) professional skills such as grant-writing, oral presentations, and clinical connection.

"Advanced Training at the Interface of Engineering and Oral-Craniofacial Sciences Oral diseases and disorders in the craniofacial complex disproportionally and devastatingly afflict susceptible populations, particularly impoverished families and medically or physically compromised persons. Novel engineering approaches, properly leveraged, can yield new paradigms to reveal disease mechanism, new strategies for disease mitigation, and new approaches for affordable/personalized therapies for dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral cancer. To achieve this vision, academic research bound dentist-scientists must be adept in engineering concepts and engineers must be educated in oral and craniofacial sciences and needs; all must be aware of the complex clinical and regulatory landscapes. To address this urgent need, we propose a multidisciplinary training program in Penn’s School of Dental Medicine (PDM) and School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS) focused on training dentist-scientists and engineers for academic careers dedicated to research in precision oral health and healthcare innovation. Postdoctoral trainees will adopt cutting-edge approaches at the forefront of engineering and computational sciences to advance the fields of oral biofilm microbiome, host immunity and tissue regeneration, drawing on approaches including artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and materials sciences, aware of developmental hurdles and requirements to safely bring new approaches to patients. Trainees will engage in interactive and tailored academic experiences with intensive mentored research via co-mentoring (one advisor from each school), and interaction with a career mentoring committee (CMC) that includes at least one dental clinician. Co-mentors and CMC members will be drawn from the Program Faculty of 26 faculty in PDM and SEAS with significant records of mentorship of multidisciplinary and translational research. Training will include: (1) engineering fundamentals for dental trainees and oral & craniofacial biology principles for engineering trainees, tailored to match their research project and academic needs, (2) clinical research and regulatory affairs, (3) principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility, (4) scientific writing and (5) workshops on professional and career development. Trainees will engage in academic and industry interactions, journal club, give symposia presentations, and participate in AADR/IADR activities. Training will culminate in F/K award applications focused on advancing oral health at the dental-engineering interface. The applicant pool at the University of Pennsylvania is exceptionally strong and diverse, and we anticipate being able to attract outstanding candidates. Furthermore, via partnerships with ADA, AADR/IADR and minority-serving dental schools, we will diversify our candidate pool. We plan to enroll 4 trainees per year. Importantly, this effort will be an element of a newly formed inter-school center between PDM and SEAS with shared funding. The proposed program, unique to Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment within a compact campus where resources for both schools are united through Penn’s new Center for Innovation and Precision Dentistry. Advances in engineering approaches offer previously unimagined opportunities to advance the NIDCR 2030 vision of precision oral health for all. To harness this opportunity, a critical mass of cross-trained dentists and engineers engaged in oral and craniofacial research are urgently needed.

"Advanced Training at the Interface of Engineering and Oral-Craniofacial Sciences Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Oral diseases and disorders in the craniofacial complex disproportionally and devastatingly afflict susceptible populations, particularly impoverished families and medically or physically compromised persons. Novel engineering approaches, properly leveraged, can yield new paradigms to reveal disease mechanism, new strategies for disease mitigation, and new approaches for affordable/personalized therapies for dental caries, periodontal diseases, and oral cancer. To achieve this vision, academic research bound dentist-scientists must be adept in engineering concepts and engineers must be educated in oral and craniofacial sciences and needs; all must be aware of the complex clinical and regulatory landscapes. To address this urgent need, we propose a multidisciplinary training program in Penn’s School of Dental Medicine (PDM) and School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (SEAS) focused on training dentist-scientists and engineers for academic careers dedicated to research in precision oral health and healthcare innovation. Postdoctoral trainees will adopt cutting-edge approaches at the forefront of engineering and computational sciences to advance the fields of oral biofilm microbiome, host immunity and tissue regeneration, drawing on approaches including artificial intelligence, robotics, nanotechnology, and materials sciences, aware of developmental hurdles and requirements to safely bring new approaches to patients. Trainees will engage in interactive and tailored academic experiences with intensive mentored research via co-mentoring (one advisor from each school), and interaction with a career mentoring committee (CMC) that includes at least one dental clinician. Co-mentors and CMC members will be drawn from the Program Faculty of 26 faculty in PDM and SEAS with significant records of mentorship of multidisciplinary and translational research. Training will include: (1) engineering fundamentals for dental trainees and oral & craniofacial biology principles for engineering trainees, tailored to match their research project and academic needs, (2) clinical research and regulatory affairs, (3) principles of scientific rigor and reproducibility, (4) scientific writing and (5) workshops on professional and career development. Trainees will engage in academic and industry interactions, journal club, give symposia presentations, and participate in AADR/IADR activities. Training will culminate in F/K award applications focused on advancing oral health at the dental-engineering interface. The applicant pool at the University of Pennsylvania is exceptionally strong and diverse, and we anticipate being able to attract outstanding candidates. Furthermore, via partnerships with ADA, AADR/IADR and minority-serving dental schools, we will diversify our candidate pool. We plan to enroll 4 trainees per year. Importantly, this effort will be an element of a newly formed inter-school center between PDM and SEAS with shared funding. The proposed program, unique to Penn, leverages a superb research and training environment within a compact campus where resources for both schools are united through Penn’s new Center for Innovation and Precision Dentistry. Project Summary/Abstract Page 6 Contact PD/PI: KOO, HYUN Advances in engineering approaches offer previously unimagined opportunities to advance the NIDCR 2030 vision of precision oral health for all. To harness this opportunity, a critical mass of cross-trained dentists and engineers engaged in oral and craniofacial research are urgently needed. We will develop this workforce.

"Pathophysiology of Myocardial Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease continues to be a dominant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and throughout the world. While many gains have been achieved in some areas, the epidemic of obesity, diabetes, and life-style risk factors is contributing to expanding prevalence of heart failure. The advances made over the past decade have resulted from the dedication and talents of many researchers in basic, translational, clinical, and population epidemiological scientific inquiry. For nearly 45 years, The Johns Hopkins T32 Program in Cardiovascular Disease has trained many of these researchers, and with this renewal proposal we aim to continue this success. Our philosophy is to provide a broad-based, multi- and inter- disciplinary research environment with which to train post-doctoral fellows in basic, translational, clinical, and/or population science. Our program accepts physicians in Cardiology - some with PhDs as well who are dedicated to pursuing an academic research career, as well as non- clinical trainees (PhD or MD) pursuing cardiovascular science. This mixture of basic and clinical scientists has fostered an unusual environment conducive to out-of-the-box thinking and translation of novel approaches to new understandings and treatment of cardiovascular disease. While centered in the Division of Cardiology, the program engages faculty throughout the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions with expertise and interest in cardiovascular research. This includes faculty in Divisions/Departments of Pulmonary Medicine, Pediatrics, Epidemiology, Pathology, Biomedical Engineering, Computer Science, and Genetic Medicine. All have long- standing collaborations with Cardiology Division faculty. The primary areas of research covered in our program encompass basic science in ventricular and vascular pathobiology, pulmonary hypertension; regenerative cell biology and tissue engineering; immunology and metabolism; computational modeling, and bioinformatics including artificial intelligence and deep learning. Clinical and translational research focuses on heart failure, electrophysiology, cardiovascular imaging, and interventional cardiology. Large population studies focus on epidemiological studies and health care delivery. The program supports 12 positions for generally 2 years of research training. It also includes two positions with a structured year of formal course work to provide a master’s degree or certificate program in clinical investigation, epidemiology or public health. With this renewal, we continue our primary goal of providing leadership in academic cardiology, training future leaders in all levels of research to help combat cardiovascular disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE Heart and vascular disease is a leading cause of disability and death in the United States. The Johns Hopkins Cardiology Post-doctoral Training Program, now in its 44th consecutive year, provides broad multi-disciplinary training spanning from basic science up through to population/outcomes research.

"An Interdisciplinary Program for Advanced Training in Health Data Analytics The proposed training program adds predoctoral and postdoctoral training to the Carolina Health Informatics Program (CHIP), which concentrates on both advancing research and training in biomedical and health informatics. CHIP is a truly interdisciplinary program co- created and co-sponsored by 1) School of Medicine, 2) Gillings School of Global Public Health, 3) School of Nursing, 4) Eshelman School of Pharmacy, 5) School of Dentistry, 6) School of Information & Library Science, and 7) Computer Science Department of the College of Arts & Sciences. The program is further strengthened by close partnerships with area health care organizations and companies specializing in biopharmaceuticals, heath care, IT and analytics. Recognizing the many challenges associated with health data analytics and use, the three foundational aspects of the CHIP training programs are: 1) Methods for health data analytics, 2) Building powerful interactive analytics systems that allow customization and support decision making for a wide variety of health care operations, and 3) Addressing translational challenges in implementing and managing information systems that leverage health data analytics effectively. Given that CHIP is a highly interdisciplinary program, it will draw upon its diverse faculty, research centers, laboratories, and other rich resources to develop three major types of activities as part of the proposed advanced predoctoral and postdoctoral training program. The three activities are: 1) Research methods and analytics techniques for clinical data science, imaging informatics, precision medicine, and big data analytics for population health, 2) Didactic learning based on courses in machine learning, biostatistics, big data management, and visual analytics and additional courses that are rooted in realistic health care problems, and 3) Large- scale, population-oriented system development, deployment, and outcome evaluation. Improving human health by leveraging health data analytics demands that the critical problems and development of solutions are approached from a broad perspective, carefully taking into account evidence ranging from molecular-scale to population-scale and drawing upon knowledge from biostatistics, information science, and computing. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's CHIP program encompasses and leverages seven different academic units and it builds upon a five-year legacy to expand its offerings to train next generation health informatics researchers, academics, and leaders.",An Interdisciplinary Program for Advanced Training in Health Data Analytics,10213139,T15LM012500,"['Address', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological Products', 'Biometry', 'Caring', 'Clinical Data', 'Custom', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Science', 'Decision Making', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Gills', 'Healthcare', 'Information Sciences', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Library Science', 'Machine Learning', 'Management Information Systems', 'Methods', 'Outcome', 'Pharmacy Schools', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research Methodology', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'School Dentistry', 'School Nursing', 'Schools', 'Science', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Training Programs', 'Visual', 'base', 'big data management', 'biomedical informatics', 'college', 'computer science', 'faculty research', 'health care service organization', 'health data', 'imaging informatics', 'medical schools', 'operation', 'population health', 'post-doctoral training', 'pre-doctoral', 'precision medicine', 'programs']",NLM,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,T15,2021,500423
"Institutional Career Development Core The KL2 Mentored Clinical Scholars Program attracts a diverse group of highly talented junior faculty across multiple disciplines from across Yale University (Schools of Medicine, Nursing, Public Health, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and Applied Science) who will pursue careers in T1-T4 translational research. This Program has been extremely successful, attracting 151 Scholars who have authored >5200 publications, have been PIs on 258 NIH grants, and have received a total of $557 million in grant funding. Remarkably, 99% of our KL2 Scholars have attained positions in academia, industry or public health conducting, and often with leadership responsibilities for, clinical and translational research. We aim to build on this success by providing Scholars with individualized, competency-based training in translational research that prepares them to contribute to the learning healthcare system, to advance personalized health, and to address health disparities. This preparation includes training in clinical trials, big data, machine learning, bioinformatics, multidisciplinary translational research, team science, implementation science and community-based participatory research. It also introduces them to regulatory issues, bioethics, Good Clinical Practices, and factors that drive rigor, transparency, and replicability. The KL2 promotes the development of relevant competencies among the Scholars by providing: 1) opportunities to work successfully in complex and diverse multidisciplinary research teams, 2) access to mentorship by senior mentors and recent Clinical Scholars, 3) externships in industry, public health and regulatory agencies, and 4) intensive training in grant-writing and in multidisciplinary team science. To oversee these diverse, highly motivated junior investigators, we have an educational leadership team of: 1) three outstanding investigator mentors who work in different areas of translational research, 2) an experienced Diversity Officer, and 3) an expert in evaluating and dynamically reshaping medical education programs. This leadership team has used feedback from prior Scholars and their mentors to add new initiatives to the already successful program. We expanded our logic model to implement social network analyses to track the activities of the Scholars, and we will expand the curriculum to include a new course. That course will mix Scholars and TL-1 trainees who will work in teams as they get formal training and peer mentoring in a variety of areas such as big data/machine learning, diversity and inclusion, and running a research laboratory. With these additions to an already strong curriculum, we believe that the Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program will be ideally positioned to train the next generation of leaders in T1-T4 translational research who will transform healthcare in ways that alleviate the burden of disease and improve health in the US and around the world. The Specific Aims of the KL2 are: Aim 1: The Yale Mentored Clinical Scholars Program: To provide a program comprised of a mentored research experience, coursework, and seminars that are intended to promote the emergence of scientific independence and the career development of talented young T1-T4 translational scientist Scholars. Aim 2: The Yale Masters in Health Science Program: To provide those M.D. Scholars who do not possess an advanced research degree with additional coursework and scholarly activities to qualify for a Masters in Health Science (MHS) to address limitations in their scientific preparation for a research career. n/a",Institutional Career Development Core,10368487,KL2TR001862,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Applied Research', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Big Data', 'Bioethics', 'Bioinformatics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Competence', 'Complex', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Discipline of Nursing', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Engineering', 'Faculty', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Good Clinical Practice', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Health Sciences', 'Healthcare', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Industry', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Laboratory Research', 'Leadership', 'Learning', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical Education', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'NCI Scholars Program', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Preparation', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Science', 'Social Network', 'Talents', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'career', 'career development', 'community based participatory research', 'experience', 'externship', 'health disparity', 'implementation science', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'multidisciplinary', 'next generation', 'peer coaching', 'programs', 'success', 'translational scientist']",NCATS,YALE UNIVERSITY,KL2,2021,1318718
