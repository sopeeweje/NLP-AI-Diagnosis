"Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome Project Summary/Abstract The high risk of neurodevelopmental impairments is a major concern for parents and clinicians caring for premature babies. Annually, approximately 22,000 very preterm infants (i.e. ≤32 weeks gestational age) in the United States develop cognitive deficits. Efforts to target interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental sequelae are hampered by our current inability to diagnose disabilities before the age of 3 to 5 years. Research supports the notion that cognitive deficits may result from a perturbation of neural connection and communication. Recent brain connectome studies in adults and older children show that abnormal network properties are useful as prognostic biomarkers. Many of these studies have exploited machine learning models based on brain connectome data for the prediction of a variety of neurological conditions, however this progress has not been fully extended to the preterm population. Our preliminary studies suggest that early and accurate prediction of cognitive deficits at an individual level is possible using machine learning models based on brain connectome features at term corrected age (CA). We have correctly classified 91.3% of very preterm infants at high risk of cognitive deficits with 90% specificity and 92.3% sensitivity. Our overall objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that can analyze integrated structural and functional brain connectome data obtained at term CA to make a prediction of later cognitive deficits in very preterm infants. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning techniques analyzing integrated structural and functional brain connectome features at birth can predict cognitive deficits at 2 years CA at an individual level in very preterm infants with accuracy of greater than 90%, exceeding the performance of current classical multivariate analyses. The two specific aims to test the central hypothesis are: 1) Develop and implement a machine learning model to extract high-level brain connectome features and 2) Develop and validate a machine learning framework to predict cognitive deficits. On completion of the first aim, we will explicate the brain connectome, and extract high-dimensional connectome features that best represent the brain connectome. In the second aim, the machine learning model we proposed will be applied in predicting both cognitive deficit (i.e. 2-class classification) and cognitive scores on a continuous scale (i.e., regression) at 2 years CA. To quantify the model's discrimination, we will also validate its performance in data that are not used for the model development, and compare with the current conventional multivariate approach. The proposed research is significant because it will increase scientific knowledge about the developing brain connectome in very preterm infants and facilitate earlier identification of babies at high risk of neurodevelopmental deficits, allowing timely clinical interventions for optimal cognitive outcome. Project Narrative Babies born before 32 weeks' gestational age are at a very high risk of developing cognitive deficits, which may impact their brain function in many ways, including life-long learning difficulties. Fortunately, infant brains are highly malleable, so it is important to identify those at highest risk as early as possible to allow effective early interventions. We propose to apply a reliable, accurate and sensitive artificial intelligence approach based on state-of-the-art brain MRI to allow identification of babies at highest risk of learning difficulties.",Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome,9759972,R21HD094085,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Premature Infant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'autoencoder', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'disability', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'interest', 'life-long learning', 'medical complication', 'model development', 'neonate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2019,238500,0.024982880418064814
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9695211,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,522460,0.07267662658767331
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9687747,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidimensional data', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2019,163943,0.04543564662506513
"Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Project Summary/Abstract: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Brain monitoring in critical care has grown dramatically over the past 20 years with the discovery that a large proportion of ICU patients suffer from subclinical seizures and seizure-like electrical events, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), detectable only by electroencephalography (EEG). This growth has created a crisis in critical care: It is clear that IIICAs damage the brain and cause permanent neurologic disability. Yet detection of IIICAs by expert visual review is often delayed suggesting we need better tools for real-time monitoring, to cope with the deluge of ICU EEG data. In other cases, IIICAs appear to be harmless epiphenomena, and many worry that increased awareness of IIICAs has created an epidemic of overly-aggressive prescribing of anticonvulsant drugs leading to preventable adverse events and costs. This crisis highlights critical unmet needs for automated EEG monitoring for IIICAs, and a better understanding of which types of IIICAs cause neural injury and warrant intervention. Causes of IIICAs range widely, from primary brain injuries like hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, to systemic medical illnesses like sepsis and uremia. Until recently, this massive clinical heterogeneity has been an insurmountable barrier to understanding the impact of IIICAs on neurologic outcome. However, recent advances in deep learning, coupled with the unprecedented availability of a massive dataset developed by our team over the last three years, makes it feasible for the first time to systematically study the relationship between IIICAs and neurologic outcomes. To meet the need for better monitoring tools and better models for understanding IIICAs, we will take a deep learning approach to leverage the as-yet untapped information in a massive ICU EEG dataset. We will pursue three Specific Aims: SA1: Comprehensively label all occurrences of IIICAs in a massive set of cEEG recordings, thus preparing the EEG data for training computers to detect IIICA patterns; SA2: Develop supervised DL algorithms to detect IIICAs as accurately as human experts, thus providing powerful tools for both research on IIICAs and for clinical brain monitoring; SA3: Estimate the effect of IIICAs on neurologic outcome: we will develop models to quantify effects of IIICAs on risk for disability after controlling for inciting illness and other clinical factors, and to predict effects of interventions to suppress IIICAs. This work will provide four crucial benefits to advance the field of precision critical care neurology, and by extension, our ability to provide optimal neurologic care for patients during critical illness. 1) Improved understanding of the clinical significance of seizure like IIICA states; 2) development of robust tools and algorithms for critical care brain telemetry; 3) a unique, massive, publicly available, thoroughly annotated dataset that will enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials. Project Narrative: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum RELEVANCE: Seizures and seizure-like brain activity, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), occur commonly in electroencephalogram recordings of brain activity in ICU patients, and simultaneously represent a preventable cause of brain injury and a common cause of over-treatment and iatrogenic harm to patients. Big Data and deep learning approaches have recently enabled advances in several fields of medicine, but have so far had little impact in ICU neuromedicine. This project will use Big Data and Deep Learning to advance the goal of protecting brain health in ICU patients, by 1) providing improved understanding of the clinical significance of IIICA states; 2) developing robust tools and algorithms for ICU brain telemetry; 3) creating a unique, massive, publicly available, annotated dataset to enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) developing a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials.",Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum,9769180,R01NS107291,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthetics', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Label', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurology', 'Nomenclature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Supervision', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uremia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'brain health', 'causal model', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'nerve injury', 'neurophysiology', 'overtreatment', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'real time monitoring', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2019,559137,-0.03167724383398037
"Brain Science Compute Cluster Computational requirements of contemporary brain science research typically exceed financial and resource management limits of individual investigator laboratories. Many brain science research projects require analysis of large data sets with advanced statistical methods and anatomical reconstruction techniques. These methods require high speed computational and graphics engines operating in a multiple processor environments equipped with large capacity, high speed storage devices. An ongoing limitation in the Brown brain science effort at understanding neural processing is the lack of a contemporary and readily accessible high-speed computational resource.  We plan to replace an existing, but 5 year old and now outmoded, central computational resource that has outdated graphic processing units (GPU) and central processing units (CPU) and and limited storage that will serve the computational needs of a core group of brain science investigators at Brown without compromising individual access to stand-alone workstations. The requested computation equipment comprises 13 GPU nodes (total of 52 cores), 12 CPU nodes (288 cores) and 1.2 petabytes of disk storage, which will serve the needs of the assembled brain science researchers. The equipment will become integrated into Brown's high performance Compute Cluster, which has system software that automatically balances GPU and CPU usage, thereby ensuring maximum access to the computational resource for all users. Intensive 3D graphics are off- loaded either to GPUs or to client workstations, thereby further reducing the central computational load. Commercial or open-source software with an open operating environment will be used for analysis using standard and novel statistical and machine learning approaches to assess significance of large data sets.  This proposal details the architecture and benefits of a contemporary computational resource for the major and minor users, and more generally the Brown brain science community. The resource was designed to fill immediate and near-term computational and storage needs of a core group of Brown brain scientists.

Expansion of the existing core investigators group can occur easily since the computational power or storage capacity of the system can be readily enhanced at relatively low cost.

"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders. Detailed analysis of structural relationships of both blood and lymphatic circulation in the brain system will have a direct impact on our general understanding of vascular function in brain/meningeal communication, and the cause and resolution of numerous diseases resulting from intracranial vascular disorders including impact of sex hormone (estrogen) deprivation, sleep deprivation, migraines, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dural arterio-venous fistulae, intradural hygroma and hematoma, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and intradural aneurysms that can lead to the development of neurological and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's. Quantitative description of blood and lymphatic vessel network structures using image analytics and machine learning algorithms distributed as software tools will have broad applications to quantification of other thin complex curvilinear anatomical structures (i.e. nerves, neuronal circuits, neurons, and neuroglia). The new software for blood and vessel network measurement will enable translation of fundamental pathophysiological knowledge gained from this proposal towards the development and assessment of the effectiveness of treatments and therapeutic interventions to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability associated with a range of neurological disorders.",Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system,9712424,R01NS110915,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animals', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Insomnia', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Lymphangioma', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Estrogens', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Health', 'Hematoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lymphatic', 'Lymphatic vessel', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meningeal', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subdural Hematoma', 'Subdural Hygroma', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vascular resistance', 'Venous', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'body system', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'geometric structure', 'in vivo', 'lymphatic circulation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microleakage', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal circuitry', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'response', 'sex', 'sleep pattern', 'solute', 'stem', 'submicron', 'tool', 'wasting']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2019,540520,0.01855578331270603
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment.

"Mosaicism in focal cortical dysplasias spectrum seen in neuropsychiatric disease Abstract/Summary  Our parent grant U01-MH108898 entitled “Mosaicism in focal cortical dysplasias spectrum seen in neuropsychiatric disease” has a focus on understanding the mechanisms of dysplasia of the cerebral cortex, and the contribution of brain somatic mosaicism to this process. Mosaicism is the occurrence of two (or more) genomes in an individual who is derived from a single zygote. Members of the NIMH-supported Brain Somatic Mosaicism Network (BSMN) are characterizing mosaic variation in other neuropsychiatric disorders with a common goal of assessing the role of somatic mosaic variation across diseases including BPD, schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, Tourette syndrome, and dysplasias. We propose three capstone projects to map the full spectrum of somatic variation in human brain and characterize the contributions of mosaic variants to neuropsychiatric disease risk. These capstones can advance the mission of the BSMN, to both achieve greater power of discovery of somatic mutations by combining and harmonizing deep coverage whole genome sequencing data that have been generated across nodes, as well as placing the variants identified through the study of brain somatic mosaicism (BSM) in the context of neurodevelopment and disease. To integrate this multi- dimensional data from the BSMN, as well as other consortia, administrative supplements are requested to continue, in the final two years of the award, three capstone projects, as well as to contribute to the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) and data analytic core (DAC). We expect these Capstone Projects to increase the profile of the BSMN by creating an unprecedented data resource of somatic mosaicism variants across development and diseases widely available to the scientific community. The enhanced power provided by the combined analyses of the BSMN will provide foundational knowledge that will guide future work, and lead to new insight into brain somatic mosaicism. The specific aims are (1) for Capstone 2, to assess the somatic mutational landscape in the human brain, by an unprecedented, comprehensive mapping of brain mosaicism in a single person; (2) for Capstone 3, to exploit deeply sequenced bulk short-read WGS to detect somatic structural variation by refining and employing a novel machine-learning classifier approach named CHONK that was developed in our lab. Project Narrative This project assesses the natural mosaic variation in the human brain using unprecedented depth on comprehensive sampling to analyze the mosaicism within a single individual. We will further extend our analysis of mosaic variation to structural variants by employing a novel, machine-learning based, classifier. 1",Mosaicism in focal cortical dysplasias spectrum seen in neuropsychiatric disease,9905189,U01MH108898,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Communities', 'Cortical Dysplasia', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Dysplasia', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Gilles de la Tourette syndrome', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Medial', 'Microglia', 'Mission', 'Mosaicism', 'Names', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Process', 'Recording of previous events', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Somatic Mutation', 'Structure', 'Time', 'Unmarried person', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'data resource', 'disorder risk', 'genome sequencing', 'insight', 'member', 'multidimensional data', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'parent grant', 'whole genome', 'zygote']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",U01,2019,248888,0.029925125863625394
"Development of brain-computer interface methods to influence brain dynamics in stuttering Project summary Brain dynamics that drive variability within and between patients are an important, but poorly understood, element of many cognitive disorders. The long-term goal of this research project is to develop technology that will identify brain activity patterns associated with successful performance on a given task, and use this pattern as a target for brain-computer interface (BCI) training. The overarching hypothesis is that using BCI training to more often have a brain state that is spontaneously correlated to good performance will, in turn, improve overall performance. This approach could be developed into a powerful tool for rehabilitation and therapy for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here we will investigate persistent developmental stuttering (PDS) as a model to study brain dynamics associated with successful vs. unsuccessful performance. PDS is a speech disorder where fluent speech is punctuated to various degrees by stuttering. Individuals with PDS are otherwise neurologically in the normal range, which avoids complicating factors in most patient populations. Stuttering is intermittent; thus on some occasions the brain is in a state conducive to fluent speech and at other times it is not. We propose to use EEG activity shortly before speaking to predict whether somebody with PDS will stutter or speak fluently. Preliminary data are given to show proof of concept with traditional EEG analysis methods. This approach will be expanded by first using advanced methods such as common spatial pattern analysis and machine learning over multiple subject sessions to identify EEG signals that distinguish fluent vs. dysfluent trials (Aim 1). PDS subjects will then be trained to produce and maintain their EEG pattern that is most strongly associated with fluent speech by using BCI methods. We hypothesize that individuals will learn to modulate EEG features to be more consistent with fluent trials, which in turn will significantly reduce stuttering rate. After successful completion of this project we envision a new BCI-based intervention that can be used to encourage neural states conducive to fluent speech in those who stutter. The BCI intervention would complement traditional speech therapy using behavioral methods. The “two-step approach” of first identifying brain states associated with a patient’s best performance followed by BCI training to enter that state more often can be applied to rehabilitation in many other neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury, and mood disorders, to name a few. Project narrative The goal of this project is to develop brain-computer interface technology to optimize brain function on an individual basis. This could have therapeutic applications to many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and traumatic brain injury.",Development of brain-computer interface methods to influence brain dynamics in stuttering,9659309,R21DC016353,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Stuttering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Names', 'Neurologic', 'Normal Range', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stroke', 'Stuttering', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'improved', 'indexing', 'motor control', 'nervous system disorder', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R21,2019,170514,-0.03807720415297681
"Measuring post-arrest neurologic injury via nanofluidic assay of brain-derived exosomal RNA Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) strikes over 300,000 people in the US annually. Between 30-50% of OHCA survivors experience some degree of long-term neurologic injury, from mild cognitive defects to severe disability. These injuries are the result of a complex set of ischemia-reperfusion phenomena, known as the post-cardiac arrest syndrome (PCAS), that occurs over the first few days after resuscitation. Prognostication during this critical period, and prediction of neurologic disability, remains an enormous challenge. Serologic markers of brain injury, such as nerve-specific enolase or S100-B, have been tested extensively but have limited predictive value. Quantifying PCAS injury during clinical care has remained a key knowledge gap; with more accurate injury measurement, clinicians would be better able to tailor patient care appropriately by adjusting the intensity of brain-protective therapies including targeted temperature management. Our team has developed a novel approach to injury assessment that applies nanofluidic technology to isolate and analyze brain-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) from serum, small circulating bodies that represent their cells of origin and are released into the blood in greater quantity when cells are damaged or die. Exosomes carry a collection of microRNA (miRNA) species that can be measured and sequenced, allowing for precise analysis of a “transcriptome of brain injury”. When we coupled brain-derived exosomal miRNA analysis with machine learning techniques, we demonstrated that exosomal measurement predicted injury severity after traumatic brain injury. We now seek to apply this technology to post-arrest neurologic assessment; we hypothesize that serial EV sampling will allow for more precise measurement of PCAS-related brain injury. We will perform serial blood sampling of adult (age>17 y) non-traumatic resuscitated OHCA patients (0,6,12,24 h post-arrest) as well as from a negative control set of patients with myocardial infarction and positive control set of patients with significant cerebrovascular accident. We will characterize brain-derived miRNA species from both cohorts, first in a “derivation group” (n=10) and then a “validation group” (n=40) for each cohort. We will collect demographic and clinical outcome data, including neurologic status at discharge and at 90 d via modified Rankin Scale (mRS), dichotomized into “good” (mRS 0-2) or “poor” (mRS 3-6) outcome. A machine learning algorithm will be applied to the derivation group to develop an injury predictive tool, which will then be tested in the validation group. We hypothesize that (1) EV-derived miRNA will identify OHCA patients with brain injury at discharge compared to negative controls and (2) miRNA analysis will discriminate between OHCA patients with good or bad outcomes. Finally, we will apply the predictive tool across 4 timepoints in the OHCA cohort, hypothesizing that more injured patients will show a more significant injury miRNA pattern among earlier timepoints. If successful, this strategy could be coupled to post-arrest trials that require real-time neurologic injury evaluation, and could enable clinicians to tailor care to improve long-term neurologic outcomes. NARRATIVE Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest afflicts >300,000 people in the U.S. each year. Many resuscitated victims die before hospital discharge or suffer enduring neurologic disabilities from ischemia-reperfusion injury, yet our ability to quantitatively measure these injuries during critical care are limited. We propose to test a novel diagnostic approach to address this, using nanofluidic technology to isolate and characterize brain-derived microRNAs from a cohort of initial survivors of cardiac arrest, compared to a control cohort of patients with myocardial infarction (negative control) and a cohort of patients with stroke (positive control).",Measuring post-arrest neurologic injury via nanofluidic assay of brain-derived exosomal RNA,9824489,R21NS109763,"['Acute', 'Acute myocardial infarction', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood specimen', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'CD81 gene', 'Caliber', 'Caring', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Data', 'Derivation procedure', 'Development', 'Discriminant Analysis', 'Epitopes', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'GLAST Protein', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Heart Arrest', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Hospitals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Investigation', 'Ischemia', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'MicroRNAs', 'Microfluidics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mothers', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nerve', 'Nervous System Trauma', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurological status', 'Neuronal Injury', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Plasma', 'Predictive Value', 'Quality of life', 'RNA', 'Reperfusion Injury', 'Reperfusion Therapy', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resuscitation', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Stroke', 'Surface', 'Survivors', 'Syndrome', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temperature', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cell injury', 'cell type', 'clinical care', 'cohort', 'critical period', 'differential expression', 'disability', 'enolase', 'exosome', 'experience', 'extracellular vesicles', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'injured', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microvesicles', 'multidisciplinary', 'nanofluidic', 'nanoscale', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'out-of-hospital cardiac arrest', 'predictive tools', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'serological marker', 'species difference', 'tool', 'transcriptome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2019,442750,0.022609001938693012
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9741540,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,459850,0.026134895889723193
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9645112,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'source localization', 'surgery outcome']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2019,516327,0.032492737007987896
"White Matter Connectivity and Network Analysis In a project with the investigators from the Section on Quantitative Imaging and Tissue Sciences (SQITS), NICHD and the Nervous System Development and Plasticity Section (NSDPS), NICHD we developed different models of myelin plasticity, or generally, delay plasticity in which we show how the stability of the synchronized state in the network, as well as general stability of the system, relies on having such adaptive delay. The consequences of such adaptive time delays are studied for three main cases: a) where the plasticity is activity-dependent; b) where the plasticity depends on the time arrivals of the postsynaptic and presynaptic action potentials; and c) where the plasticity depends on the oligodendrocytes myelinated multiple axons. For (a), we studied the effect of activity-dependent adaptive time delays on the stability of the system of coupled oscillators, with its implications on the stability of the oscillations and synchrony in the brain, while b) and c) are studied in terms of synchronization in the spiking neural networks. A manuscript describing this work is in preparation.  In collaboration with NSDPS and SQITS, we studied the dynamic regulation of myelin by the surrounding glial cells and show that it is regulated by the astrocytes based on the level of activity present in an axon. We elucidated the biological mechanisms by which astrocytes regulate this process and use a theoretical framework to predict how the changes in myelin thickness, as well as the increase in the nodal width, affects the propagation of the signals along a myelinated axon, and to experimentally measure conduction speeds using a data analysis framework we implemented. The theoretical and experimental results were in a very good agreement. This work has been published the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) in November of 2018.  In 2019 I joined the investigators in SQITS in their ongoing double pulsed-field gradient (dPFG) MRI study of tissue microstructure in traumatic brain injury. In a newly started project, we are applying the machine learning framework previously developed for the study of patterns of gene expression in developing zebrafish to help with identifying regions of traumatic brain injury using a number of different MRI stains.   We continue research under the R24 BRAIN Initiative grant (""In Vivo Brain Network Latency Mapping"") in which several other principal investigators from NIH (NICHD, NINDS, and NIMH) are participated. The goal of this effort is to measure the temporal latencies (i.e., the time delays) in a human brain signaling between different regions. Being able to measure the latency information in vivo can provide a great diagnostic tool for a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Our experimental protocol consists of four different imaging modalities: diffusion MRI, providing the structural information, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) which provides dynamic and functional information. In November of 2018 we presented our work at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in San Diego, CA. We showed the results obtained with the novel algorithms we developed for extracting latency information from the time series data. In 2019 these algorithms are being validated using electrocorticography (ECoG) data and will be used on a newly acquired MEG time-series data, addressing situations for which the latency information between pairs of cortical regions is well known. n/a",White Matter Connectivity and Network Analysis,10016004,ZIACT000275,"['Action Potentials', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Astrocytes', 'Axon', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Collaborations', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electrocorticogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurosciences', 'Nodal', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Width', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'nervous system development', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'quantitative imaging', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'white matter']",CIT,CENTER  FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,ZIA,2019,263074,0.02744622011219048
"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Integrating human connectomics and brain imaging genomics offers enormous potential, allowing us to perform systems biology approaches of the brain to better understand the interplay between genes, brain connectivity, and phenotypic outcomes (e.g., cognition, behavior, disorder). This proposal seeks to develop novel bioinformatics methods and software tools for integrative study of human connectomics and brain imaging genomics. These methods and tools can be applied to: (1) study normal brain functions to impact biomedical research in general, and (2) study brain disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics,9694688,R01EB022574,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'base', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic architecture', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning outcome', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phenotypic data', 'public health relevance', 'software systems', 'tool', 'tractography', 'trait', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,450954,0.033782458961269905
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9717282,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2019,670982,0.059799634978958204
"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) – herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),9795341,R24MH120037,"['Archives', 'Awareness', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Quality', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'brain research', 'brain surgery', 'built environment', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data archive', 'data format', 'data mining', 'data structure', 'data submission', 'hackathon', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'repository', 'response', 'sensor', 'supercomputer', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web interface', 'web services', 'web site']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2019,926107,-0.016766292132782093
"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,9800892,R01MH120158,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'millisecond', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'preclinical study', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,716265,0.020430029816315625
"Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology Project Summary/Abstract The candidate’s long-term goal is to become an independent investigator focused on the neurophysiological pathways that link psychological stress with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individual differences in biological responses to acute psychological stress have been shown to predict risk for subclinical and clinical markers of CVD, indicating that variation in the stress response relates to measurable health outcomes. The proposed research and career development program will position the candidate to definitively address open and mechanistic questions on cardiovascular stress physiology with a multi-dimensional approach. The overall objective of the current project is to identify the ‘brain–cardiovascular’ pathways of metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress. The central hypothesis is that metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress are caused by increased brain activation in areas associated with cardiovascular and autonomic control. In extension, the candidate will test whether altering brain function via neuromodulation will regulate downstream cardiovascular responses. Proposed are two independent studies. In Aim 1, we will newly examine the relationship between metabolically excessive cardiovascular and neural responses using a cross-sectional approach. In Aim 2, we will measure stressor-evoked metabolic and cardiovascular responses before and after neuromodulation in an experimental approach. Participants will engage in a novel, non-invasive neuromodulation technique, transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS), known to alter the brain by increasing oxygenation, and will be compared to an established control. This research plan will help the candidate develop essential skills for career development including cardiovascular and metabolic testing, machine learning and cross-validation methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses, and utilizing a neuromodulation technique, TILS. The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide 5 years of training through a combination of research, classroom experiences, and mentoring to further the candidate in preparation for scientific independence. Specifically, the candidate will gain expertise in measuring metabolic activity, advance her computational neuroimaging analysis skills, become proficient in experimentally manipulating brain function, and develop necessary statistical skills. The project brings together a mentoring team of experts in their respective areas to provide the candidate with the necessary skills to continue on the trajectory to make a transformative contribution to the field of Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine. This project will provide vital information regarding the pathways between psychological stress and CVD risk while at the same time providing training and mentoring for the candidate’s further career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exaggerated physiological responses to psychological stress are commonly regarded as contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD), nonetheless, we lack an understanding of the mechanisms by which psychological responses to threat are translated into cardiovascular responses that are excessive to the immediate physiological needs of the individual. The project will use both cross-sectional and experimental approaches to examine how the brain and cardiovascular system interact during psychological stress and will provide a a more comprehensive understanding of the role the brain plays in metabolically-excessive responses to stress. This research is relevant to public health because it is a crucial step in understanding how psychological stress relates to a risk factor for CVD and is necessary to develop appropriate brain- based approaches to CVD risk prevention and stratification.",Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology,9821766,K01HL145021,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Markers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Limbic System', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic stress', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Professional Competence', 'Program Development', 'Psychological Stress', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'experience', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'stressor', 'time use']",NHLBI,BAYLOR UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,152227,0.013967958371278705
"Brain-wide quantitative mapping of microglia activation SUMMARY Recent technological developments such as tissue clearing and light sheet imaging have allowed for the three- dimensional visualization of the entire brain at cellular resolution. Translucence Biosystems has advanced this technology further by developing a) a proprietary Mesoscale Imaging System that allows visualization of an entire mouse brain much faster than prior techniques, b) machine learning-based algorithms that identify individual cells across the entire intact mouse brain and c) routines that rapidly determine cell densities in >1,200 brain regions defined by the annotated Allen Brain Atlas.  In the present proposal we will show the power of our technique by visualizing microglia density across the entire mouse brain as a biological marker for neuroinflammation. Microglia are the resident immune cells in the brain. While they play important roles in healthy brain function, they also mediate neuroinflammatory processes that have a significant impact in multiple neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and multiple sclerosis as well as play possible roles in several neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder, chemo brain). A tool for three-dimensional imaging of neuroinflammation patterns across the whole brain will help advance our understanding of neuroinflammatory processes in neurological diseases and aid in the evaluation of therapeutic approaches.  To visualize microglia, we will evaluate multiple strategies, including the CX3CR1-GFP mouse line, which expresses GFP in microglia, Iba1 immunolabeling and other antibody markers of activated microglia. The utility of our approach for monitoring neuroinflammation will be demonstrated in CX3CR1-GFP mice by treating them with the inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Mice will be injected with three different LPS doses, and then microglia will be visualized and automatically counted across >1,200 brain regions. We will confirm the neuroinflammatory response to LPS by measuring protein markers of inflammation.  The applicability of our technique to neurodegenerative disease will be demonstrated by studying a mouse line used as a model of Alzheimer's disease that presents pronounced patterns of neuroinflammation. These experiments are designed to prove that our approach can provide reliable and detailed information describing neuroinflammation and that our results are better in terms of speed, resolution, and richness of information than any other technique available.  Once the goals for Phase I are met, we will be positioned to develop our microglia activation assay into a new gold standard for precise and complete histological detection of neuroinflammation. During phase II, we plan to 1) develop machine learning tools to establish morphological criteria that differentiate resting from activated microglia, 2) characterize microglial signatures in various mouse models of diseases with known or suspected neuroinflammation components, and 3) validate the microglial targeting of anti-inflammatory therapeutic candidates. NARRATIVE Microglia, the resident immune cells of the brain, protect against injury and infection. Microglia also play a critical role in dysfunctional neuroinflammatory processes that contribute to the development of brain diseases. We have developed novel methods to make mouse brains transparent so we can visualize and precisely count microglia throughout the intact mouse brain. In this proposal, we will test the feasibility of measuring brain-wide microglia activation using two disease models with a strong neuroinflammatory component, including a common transgenic mouse model that recapitulates the amyloid plaque accumulation that is a central feature of Alzheimer’s Disease.",Brain-wide quantitative mapping of microglia activation,9908302,R43MH122070,"['AIDS dementia', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amyloid', 'Amyloid beta-Protein', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Antibodies', 'Atlases', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cell Density', 'Cells', 'Deposition', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease model', 'Dose', 'Encephalitis', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Genes', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Label', 'Light', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physical shape', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proliferating', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Senile Plaques', 'Site', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'abeta deposition', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'brain cell', 'chemobrain', 'cytokine', 'density', 'design', 'experimental study', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in vitro Assay', 'in vivo', 'inflammatory marker', 'interest', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'protein biomarkers', 'response', 'selective expression', 'therapeutic candidate', 'therapeutic evaluation', 'tool']",NIMH,"TRANSLUCENCE BIOSYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2019,449956,0.07009623085122317
"Neurocognitive deficits and compensation in binge drinkers ABSTRACT  Binge or heavy episodic drinking has been on the rise and is associated with a range of harmful consequences that scale up with the high intensity drinking prevalent among young adults. Evidence on the nature and extent of neural changes associated with binge drinking (BD) is scant, especially as regards sex differences, so more sensitive, high-precision imaging modalities are needed to examine persistent brain alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based methods are sensitive to brain function, as well as different neural tissue properties, and are well suited to provide multidimensional insight into the structure and organization of the brain. Despite a paucity of neuroimaging studies in BD, evidence obtained from individuals with alcohol use disorder suggests that degradation of prefrontal functions may contribute to impaired executive functions and an inability to refrain from hazardous drinking. Consistent with findings in alcohol use disorder, our data and other evidence indicate that BD participants show compensatory engagement of additional brain areas to maintain adequate performance on cognitively demanding tasks. Complementary MRI modalities can reveal the nature and regional specificity of structural degradation that underlies and constrains the compensatory reorganization.  The overall aim of this project is to use a range of MRI-based methods to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult binge drinking men and women. Because of their spatial precision and sensitivity to different neural tissue properties and functional features, MRI-based methods can provide insights into structural and functional alterations at the level of an interactive system. Specifically, BOLD fMRI will evaluate functional activation during tasks that probe cognitive control; resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis will examine alterations at the level of a functional network, while structural degradation will be reflected in gray and white matter morphometric features. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will characterize white matter microstructure and tract-based changes. These measures will be obtained from young adult men and women (18-30 yrs) who will be assigned to binge drinking (BD) and light drinking (LD) groups based on their drinking patterns and will be equated on age, race/ethnicity, and family history of alcoholism. Interactions between binge drinking and sex will be examined in all analyses. Overall, we hypothesize that neural alterations will correlate with a range of alcohol-related variables, with greater deficits and increased compensatory activity observed in BDs who engage in higher intensity drinking, with BD women being especially susceptible to functional deficits and structural degradation. Data will be integrated across imaging modalities in a machine learning classifier framework that will inform a predictive model of drinking trajectories based on 6-mos and 12-mos longitudinal follow-ups. Combined with a rich set of drinking indices, personality and behavioral variables, a constellation of brain measures will provide a mechanistic insight into the type and extend of the neural degradation underlying executive deficits and compensatory brain reorganization. NARRATIVE  The overall aim of this project is to use a multimodal MRI approach to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult men and women engaging in binge drinking. Combined with a rich set of drinking indices, dispositional measures and behavioral variables, a constellation of brain measures will provide a mechanistic insight into the neural degradation underlying altered activity and brain reorganization.",Neurocognitive deficits and compensation in binge drinkers,9825320,R21AA027371,"['Address', 'Alcoholism', 'Alcohols', 'Anisotropy', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Family history of', 'Female', 'Financial compensation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Heavy Drinking', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Personality', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Race', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Specificity', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'System', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Woman', 'addiction', 'alcohol use disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'binge drinker', 'binge drinking', 'cognitive control', 'design', 'drinking', 'emerging adult', 'executive function', 'follow-up', 'gray matter', 'hazardous drinking', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'male', 'men', 'morphometry', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'predictive modeling', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'scale up', 'sex', 'white matter', 'young adult', 'young woman']",NIAAA,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,216344,0.013064085936358693
"Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Abstract: The increasing availability of infant brain MR images, such as those that will be collected through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP, on which Dr. Shen is a Co-PI, focusing on data acquisition), affords unprecedented opportunities for precise charting of dynamic early brain developmental trajectories in understanding normative and aberrant growth. However, to fully benefit from these datasets, a major barrier that needs to be overcome is the critical lacking of computational tools for accurate processing and analysis of infant MRI data, which typically exhibit poor tissue contrast, large within tissue intensity variation, and regionally-heterogeneous and dynamic changes. To fill this critical gap, in 2012 we pioneered in creating an infant-centric MRI processing software package, called infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Tool (iBEAT), and a set of infant-specific atlases, called UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases, and further made them freely and publicly available via NITRC. Over the last 4 years, iBEAT and UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases have been downloaded 2900+ and 5600+ times, respectively, and contributed to 160+ independent research papers. As indicated by 30+ support letters, iBEAT is now driving the research for MRI studies of early brain development in many labs throughout the world. Results produced by iBEAT are also highlighted in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT, by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. To achieve this goal, we propose four aims. In Aim 1, we will create an innovative learning-based multi-source information integration framework for joint skull stripping and tissue segmentation for accurate structural measurements. Our method employs random forest to adaptively learn the optimal image appearance features from multimodality images and also informative context features from tissue probability maps. In Aim 2, we will construct longitudinal infant brain atlases at multiple time points (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age) for both T1-/T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR images. We propose a longitudinally-consistent sparse representation technique to construct representative atlases with significantly improved structural details by explicitly dealing with possible misalignments between images even after registration. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel learning-based approach for cortical topology correction and integrate it, along with our infant-centric analysis tools and atlases for cortical surfaces, into iBEAT for precise mapping of dynamic and complex cortical changes in infants. Unlike existing tools that perform poorly for infant brains, we will incorporate infant-dedicated tools for topology correction, surface reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and measurements. We will further integrate longitudinal infant cortical surface atlases equipped with parcellations based on growth trajectories. In Aim 4, we will significantly enhance iBEAT in terms of its software functionalities as well as user support via systematic outreach and training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC. Project Narrative This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. In particular, we propose four aims: 1) Learning-Based Brain Segmentation; 2) Infant Brain Atlases in the First Year of Life; 3) Cortical Surface-Based Analysis; and 4) Enhancing User Experience and Training.

"Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity Project Summary Prescription opioids, e.g., oxycodone (OXY), are commonly encountered in youth and pose a significant public health problem. In addition, there are significant individual differences in subjective responses to opioids which contribute to vulnerabilities for misuse. However, little is understood about OXY's effects on brain function, or on how individual differences in these effects might relate to variations in subjective responses. Assessment of OXY's effects on brain function is critical to understanding its abuse liability a n d will provide insight into how and why this drug leads to misuse and abuse/dependence in some, but not all, individuals. This proposal will assess the effects of low-dose OXY (10mg) on whole-brain functional connectivity (FC), and explore relationships with subjective responses in healthy young adults (ages 21 to 30 years, N=40) with limited prior opioid exposure. OXY's effects on FC during both reward- processing and resting-state will be assessed using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design incorporating multiband fMRI scanning. Subjective measures of drug response (e.g., `drug liking') will be collected before, during and after neuroimaging using NIDA PhenX measures. Neuroimaging data will be analyzed using data-driven methods to facilitate assessment of OXY's effects on FC both within hypothesized networks (e.g., salience and reward networks) as well as on patterns of between- network connectivity. Specifically, FC changes following OXY versus placebo (Aim 1) and relationships between these changes and subjective drug responses (Aim 2) will be assessed using intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD). ICD is a data-driven, voxel-to-voxel method of assessing whole-brain connectivity patterns that is not limited by specification of seed regions or connectivity thresholds. In addition, connectome-based machine-learning will be used to build a predictive model of subjective responses to OXY using data acquired during placebo scans (Aim 3). This project will for the first time assess the effects of a prescription opioid on whole-brain FC. Understanding OXY's effects on large-scale network dynamics is crucial for understanding its abuse liability, and will guide future studies of OXY in addicted and at-risk populations. Identification of networks that are predictive of subjective responses to OXY is an essential first step toward finding a reliable biomarker of opioid response that will help to identify individuals at highest risk for misuse. Project Narrative Prescription opioids are commonly encountered and, in a small proportion of individuals, may be a precursor to heroin initiation. This project will assess the effects of low-dose oxycodone (10mg) on brain function in healthy young adults (age 21 to 30 years). It will identify brain-based predictors of subjective opioid responses (`neural fingerprints') that can be used to inform prevention and intervention efforts.",Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity,9688964,R21DA045969,"['21 year old', 'Abstinence', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Cocaine', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Heroin', 'Heroin Users', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'Link', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Morphine', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurocognitive', 'Opioid', 'Oxycodone', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Spin Labels', 'Structure', 'System', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'connectome', 'connectome based predictive modeling', 'executive function', 'financial incentive', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neural network', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid misuse', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,251250,0.04011026246688583
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9692060,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2019,857083,0.05765656405107311
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9747247,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,682492,0.04778965318194216
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9783829,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'clinical database', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2019,202477,-0.00685842877257925
"Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity This proposal describes a rigorous and comprehensive plan designed to obtain expert training in advanced MRI acquisition and analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and fetal programming of health and disease risk. The proposed research relates to the public health problem of childhood obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. Obesity is a multi-factorial phenotype. Among these factors, the critical importance of energy homeostasis (balance), and the hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates it, is well established. However, it is unclear whether the observed difference in this brain circuitry between obese and normal-weight individuals is a cause or consequence of the obese state. Also, relatively little is known about the developmental origin (fetal and early postnatal) of variation in this brain circuitry and its prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. My proposal addresses this fundamental knowledge gap. I advance the overarching hypothesis that energy homeostasis brain circuitry a) already is established by the time of birth; b) exhibits developmental plasticity (fetal programming); and c) is functionally relevant (predicts postnatal adipose tissue accrual). The K99 mentored phase will be conducted under the mentorship of leading experts in fetal programming of health and disease (P. Wadhwa), brain imaging (P. Thompson), and developmental systems neuroscience (D. Fair). I will first develop novel MRI-based measures of the newborn brain circuitry underlying energy homeostasis, and then identify the prenatal determinants of variation in this circuitry. The importance of focusing efforts on the newborn brain derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time is not yet influenced by postnatal factors. In the R00 phase, I will recruit a new cohort and use a repeated measures design to address the functional relevance of the initial (newborn) setting of this brain circuitry in the context of adipose tissue accrual over infancy (a key indicator of childhood obesity risk). K99/Aim 1. Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry, this aim will fulfill an important and as yet unmet need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also technical capability. K99/Aim 2. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology) determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are associated with infant adiposity. R00/Aim 3. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity risk. R00/Aim 4. Consider the complimentary hypothesis that infant adiposity at birth is prospectively associated with changes in newborn energy homeostasis brain circuitry. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan for the applicant, Dr. Jerod Rasmussen, to obtain expert training and conduct research that aims to identify novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, identify their gestational biology determinants, and determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood obesity. The identification of brain-related biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity,9871505,K99HD100593,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemical Shift Imaging', 'Cholesterol', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'data reduction', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'energy balance', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'metabolic rate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'population based', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'sex', 'skills', 'vector', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K99,2019,108276,0.08047984892632513
"Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging Project Summary. Neuroimaging is poised to take a substantial leap forward in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of human behavior, due to a combination of improved analytic techniques and the quality of imaging data. These advances are allowing researchers to develop population-level multivariate models of the functional brain representations underlying behavior, performance, clinical status and prognosis, and other outcomes. Population-based models can identify patterns of brain activity, or `signatures', that can predict behavior and decode mental states in new individuals, producing generalizable knowledge and highly reproducible maps. These signatures can capture behavior with large effect sizes, and can be used and tested across research groups. However, the potential of such signatures is limited by neuroanatomical constraints, in particular individual variation in functional brain anatomy. To circumvent this problem, current models are either applied only to individual participants, severely limiting generalizability, or force participants' data into anatomical reference spaces (atlases) that do not respect individual functional topology and boundaries. Here we seek to overcome this shortcoming by developing new topological models for inter-subject alignment, which register participants' functional brain maps to one another. This will increase effective spatial resolution, and more importantly allow us to explicitly analyze the spatial topology of functional maps make inferences on differences in activation location and shape across persons and psychological states. We will test and validate the methods using a purpose-designed experiment (n = 120) that includes two types of naturalistic narrative experiences (movies and audio stories) and tasks from three functional domains (pain, emotion, and cognition). The tasks are designed with several constraints in mind, including: (1) systematic coverage of cognitive, emotional, and sensory tasks matched in stimulus properties (e.g., stimulus duration); and (2) multiple levels of task demand within each task, to permit parametric modeling and prediction of demand levels. We will compare our new methods to existing methods based on out-of-sample effect sizes in predicting behavior and test-retest reliability. We will make the analytic methods, software, and dataset available to other researchers, along with a library of functional reference spaces for multiple psychological states. Project Narrative. We develop new methods for enhancing the development of models that can predict behavior, clinical status, and other outcomes using neuroimaging data. Successful development will help improve the translational impact of neuroimaging. It will also contribute to developing multidisciplinary neuroscience, by promoting the development of neural signatures for specific mental processes in humans with increased precision and specificity.",Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging,9747296,R01EB026549,"['Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Charon', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gaussian model', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Processes', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Wages', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'mental state', 'model development', 'movie', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'statistics', 'translational impact']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,692050,0.025591388784918585
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9774005,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,702420,0.035585174303711324
"Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity This revised application, submitted in response to NIH PA-18-741 “Secondary Analyses in Obesity,  Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,” relates to the public health problem of childhood  obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, determinants and role of energy balance  homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. The proposal describes a comprehensive  plan designed to advance neonatal MRI analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and  fetal programming of health and disease risk. The critical importance of the  hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates energy homeostasis is well  established, and MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuits have been  associated with obesity outcomes. However, it is unclear whether the observed differences in these  brain regions and circuitry in obese relative to normal-weight individuals are a cause,  consequence, or both, of the obese state. Moreover, relatively little is known about the  developmental ontogeny of these brain regions and circuitry, particularly during the fetal period,  and their prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. This project addresses  this fundamental knowledge gap. We will develop novel measures and conduct analyses using newborn  brain imaging and other data elements from 4 inter-linked NIH-funded projects on prenatal stress  and fetal programming of brain development and infant body composition (R01 HD-060628; R01  MH-091351; R01 HD-065825; UG3 OD-023349). The importance of selecting the newborn brain as the  starting time point derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time could not yet have  been influenced by postnatal factors such as diet/feeding, thereby enabling the study to  disentangle the temporality of effects. In a recent position paper on the pathogenesis of obesity,  the U.S. Endocrine Society emphasized the need to conceptualize obesity as a disorder of the  energy homeostasis system and elucidate its underlying mechanisms and developmental influences.  Towards this objective, and using a population of ~100 mother-infant dyads followed from early  gestation through birth till 5 yrs age, we will integrate research aims that leverage the resources  of these projects to advance our understanding of the origins of childhood obesity. Aim 1.  Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional  MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry,  this aim will fulfill an important need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also  technical capability. Aim 2. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these  novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human  newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity  and subsequent childhood obesity risk. Aim 3. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology)  determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are  associated with infant adiposity. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of  energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately  provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of  childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan to conduct research that aims to identify  novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn,  determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood  obesity, and identify their gestational biology determinants. The identification of brain-related  biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment  will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early  identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity,9824927,R21DK118578,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Body Composition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Discipline of obstetrics', 'Disease', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Endocrine', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'clinically significant', 'connectome', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'energy balance', 'feeding', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'follow-up', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'inter-individual variation', 'interest', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'vector', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R21,2019,192353,0.06890628846123198
"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three‐dimensional (3D) whole‐brain imaging of non‐transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole‐brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo‐bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide‐spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state‐of‐the‐art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large‐scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,9677046,R44MH116827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'off-patent', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2019,699967,0.02662937996184
"India ENIGMA Initiative for Global Aging & Mental Health ABSTRACT Our revised proposal launches the India ENIGMA Initiative for Global Aging & Mental Health - a globally coordinated study of brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), created response to the NIH FOA: Global Brain and Nervous System Disorders Research Across the Lifespan (R01; PAR-18-834; https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-835.html). Our overall goal is to identify predictive markers in the blood, genome, and epigenome that influence brain aging in India, to better understand prognosis, and to support personalized risk evaluations on each continent. We plan to identify etiological pathways to resilience using the rich biobanking strategy developed by our partners at NIMHANS in India. To do this, we will leverage our global consortium, ENIGMA (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu), to partner with dementia research pioneers in India, creating new links between international biobanks, and building research capacity. By 2020, 70% of the world's population over age 60 will live in developing countries, with 14% in India (Mathuranath 2012). Recently, attention has been drawn to a “diversity” crisis in brain research, as most brain research is conducted in Caucasian populations from relatively wealthy backgrounds (LeWinn 2017). This lack of ethnic diversity means that: (1) we do not know if predictors of health (and disease) generalize to other ethnic groups, and (2) we fail to collect vital data that could teach us how AD progresses in populations with different genetic and environmental backgrounds. Our coordinated analyses in US/EU and Indian biobanks will help identify brain aging predictors specific to India and those that are universal. Specifically, we will: Aim 1. Create Lifespan Charts of brain aging Trajectories in India using MRI, DWI and Resting State Functional MRI. Aim 2. Identify Blood and Epigenetic Markers that Predict Brain Aging and AD in India. Aim 3. Using a combination of multimodal imaging, blood markers, and clinical data to predict clinical decline in India. We test structural equation models that hypothesize how brain aging depends on lifestyle and psychosocial factors (diet, family support, drug abuse, literacy, sleep, and depression), as well as sex, education, and AD genetic risk. With novel machine learning methods, will analyze blood markers and plasma proteomic analytes, to define processes that are harmful to brain aging. In Capacity Building Aims, we will leverage ENIGMA's successful strategies to train emerging and established scientists in India to analyze their data with high quality control and precision, with targeted biostatistical and imaging workshops to bolster capacity. This collaborative India-US initiative will enable future science initiatives, and equip the NIMHANS team with the necessary tools to train new scientists and independently conduct high impact research bridging efforts into numerous international partnerships.

"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. We will also disseminate our approaches through software tools and interactive web-based visualization of available data. 37",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,9776502,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Tars', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data reduction', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'web portal', 'white matter']",NIBIB,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,400000,0.0395835056125949
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals.

"Axonal connectomics: dense mapping of projection patterns between cortical areas Project Summary/Abstract Connectomics is a new field, created with the goal of densely or completely mapping the connections in the brain. Because this goal is at present only achievable for small organisms, connectomics has taken on two forms in the study of larger brains. Macroscale connectomics is used to describe the connections between brain areas, which in experimental animals is achieved with tracers, while humans it is typically pursued at a very coarse scale with diffusion imaging, a form of MRI. Microscale connectomics aims to create dense wiring diagrams of local circuits, small volumes of the brain with neurons that form rich networks within a local neighborhood. Macroscale connectomics lacks cellular resolution, while microscale connectomics can only reconstruct small volumes, with little information about the source of inputs entering the volume, or the targets of axons exiting it. We propose to develop a technique to bridge the gap between the microscale and the macroscale by creating experimental and analytical methods for mapping individual axons over long distances, concentrating on the largest 50% of myelinated axons (long-distance “wires”) in the brain. For the current RFA to develop “Tools to Facilitate High-Throughput Microconnectivity Analysis” we are specifically targeting one of the recommended goals, to “Develop a high-quality toolbox of methods for efficiently mapping and annotating projections” in the human brain. The method—based on high-resolution 3D imaging of antibody-stained axons—can be scaled to analyze entire brains, but here we propose to apply it to the posterior pole of a macaque brain, a large (~10 cm3) volume will contain >20 visual cortical areas. The goal is to trace most of the larger axons (>1 um) between these areas, thus creating a dense axonal connectomics data set from the cortical visual system, allowing us to examine not only the hierarchy of visual areas, but also the structure of computational maps. Ultimately, this approach will permit whole-brain analysis of axonal projections, with targeted examination of key circuits for microscale connectomics. While microscale connectomics of whole human brains will remain impossible for the foreseeable future, dense axonal mapping should be achievable in the next 5 to 10 years. This proposal offers a pathway towards this new type brain-wide anatomy: Axonal Connectomics. Project Narrative/Relevance This proposal will contribute to the fundamental question of how the brain is wired, in particular the pathways by which individual neurons communicate over long distances between different parts of the brain. One of the most promising treatments for a variety of brain disease—deep brain stimulation—is thought to work largely by activating these long distance “wires”, so a thorough understanding of their trajectories might have considerable long-term clinical importance.",Axonal connectomics: dense mapping of projection patterns between cortical areas,9822860,RF1MH117820,"['3-Dimensional', 'Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Antibodies', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automation', 'Axon', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Caliber', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Diffusion', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Infrastructure', 'Judgment', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Link', 'Macaca', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Occipital lobe', 'Organism', 'Paper', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Primates', 'Protocols documentation', 'Resolution', 'Site', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Tracer', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain volume', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'extrastriate visual cortex', 'gray matter', 'imaging approach', 'light microscopy', 'neurofilament protein H', 'nonhuman primate', 'petabyte', 'physical mapping', 'programs', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'vector', 'white matter']",NIMH,ALLEN INSTITUTE,RF1,2019,2312287,0.06154636389070071
"Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method of focally stimulating the brain that uses electromagnetic induction and does not require surgery. There is optimism that TMS will revolutionize how we treat neurological and psychiatric disorders, evidenced by over 1000 clinical trials registered using TMS. Much of this optimism stems from the successful use of TMS as a treatment for depression. Despite the large number of clinical trials using TMS the number of therapeutic indications has been stagnant, limited to major depression and more recently obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are fundamental questions about the underlying mechanisms of action for TMS that will be critical to understand in order to advance this treatment modality. Here, we propose a unique collaborative project between neurology and neurosurgery that will allow an unprecedented window into understanding how TMS impacts the human brain. Specifically, we will perform TMS in neurosurgical patients with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) monitoring to record real time effects of TMS on local and remote brain areas with an unparalleled combination of spatial and temporal resolution relative to other human studies. We have already demonstrated the safety of this approach using a gel-based phantom brain and have results from seven patients demonstrating safety and preliminary results. For the current proposal we aim to: 1) characterize the response of TMS on the human brain as recorded from iEEG between active and sham conditions, and 2) relate remote electrophysiological responses induced by TMS to measures of brain connectivity between the stimulation and recording sites assessed with resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI). This will allow us to evaluate the relationship between TMS-evoked iEEG responses and the strength of functional connectivity to the stimulation site in a regression model. We hypothesize that: 1) TMS will have focal effects detected from surface electrodes underlying the stimulation site as well as network-level engagement detected at remote sites, 2) Repetitive TMS will induce frequency- specific effects that differ between 0.5 and 10 Hz stimulation protocols, and 3) the magnitude of repetitive TMS-evoked iEEG responses across electrodes will relate to the strength of rs-fcMRI between the stimulation and recording sites. By investigating the electrophysiological responses of TMS with high spatiotemporal precision in humans, this study will provide new mechanistic insights into the effects of TMS on target engagement and relate these findings to imaging methods already in widespread use. Moreover, the TMS will be applied in a clinically meaningful way by targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a protocol used to treat depression. Generating results for these aims will be key to advancing our understanding of how TMS engages brain networks, which can be leveraged to rationally develop personalized, imaging-guided therapeutic TMS for depression and other disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will help our understanding of how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) affects the brain. We will develop a new method of measuring TMS-induced changes in brain activity with high spatial and temporal accuracy that is only possible with intracranial recording. The research will shed light on the mechanism of TMS and facilitate the development of better interventions and treatments for psychiatric diseases.",Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans,9805657,R21MH120441,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurology', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cranium', 'field study', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optimism', 'programs', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'stem', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2019,231750,0.03618059096801615
"Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging Project Summary In this project we want to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric  metabolic maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution. The key to this new technology is the novel combination of three state-of-the-art imaging concepts: (A) new hardware that enables the simultaneous  measurement of multinuclear magnetic resonance (MR) signals at different frequencies; (B) the flexibility and robustness of Plug-and-Play (PnP) MR Fingerprinting (MRF); and (C) a data fusion process driven by a cross-modality model based on statistical learning. For brevity, we will call this fused simultaneous multinuclear PnP-MRF technique MNF (Multi-Nuclear Fusion). The idea behind MNF is to rapidly capture two different kinds of quantitative  information throughout the whole brain in one single scan: (1) structural information from proton (1H) MRF such as T1, T2, and proton density (PD) (tissue-scale morphology); and (2) metabolic information related to ion  homeostasis from sodium (23Na) MRF, such as intracellular sodium concentration, and intracellular, extracellular and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume fractions (cellular-scale function). Because PnP-MRF can quantify multiple  tissue properties free of experimental bias, it enables us to employ statistical learning to discover a subject-specific cross-modality model that integrates all voxelwise inter-relationships between the multi-parametric 1H PnP-MRF (acquired at high resolution, 0.75-1 mm) and 23Na PnP-MRF (acquired at low resolution, 3-5 mm) maps. These subject-specific relations can subsequently be used to sharpen the 23Na metabolic maps to match the resolution of the 1H structural maps. The high-resolution 23Na maps will enable the assessment of metabolic processes in vivo and bridge the gap in resolution that has held back our ability to study metabolism in the living human brain, which is crucial for our understanding of the brain itself and the afflictions that affect it. This proof-of-concept implementation will be developed at 7 T, but it is expected to be adaptable to clinical 3 T MR scanners. The specific aims are: (1) Data acquisition, (1.a) multi-channel 1H/23Na RF array, (1.b) simultaneous multinuclear 3D MRF sequence; (2) Data processing, (2.a) PnP-MRF reconstruction for both 1H data (fingerprint matching to generate structural maps) and 23Na data (tissue 4-compartment model and simulation of spin 3/2 dynamics to generate metabolic maps), (2.b) cross-modality model using statistical learning, and data fusion algorithm to generate high-resolution metabolic maps; (3) Method validation, (3.a) accuracy and precision, (3.b) repeatability and reproducibility.(3) Exploratory aim: Test MNF on patients with chronic steno-occlusive disease, with  recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA)/minor stroke, presenting regional brain ischemia, at 3 time points (baseline, 8-month and 16-month follow-ups), and comparison with healthy controls. Project Narrative We propose to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric metabolic 3D maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution, based on the fusion of simultaneously acquired proton and sodium data with plug-and-play magnetic resonance fingerprinting. The fusion algorithm between high- resolution proton structural maps and low-resolution sodium metabolic maps will be based on a cross-modality model optimized with statistical learning methods, and will generate for the first time high-resolution metabolic maps related to ion homeostasis in the brain in vivo. These new fused high-resolution structural and metabolic maps will provide new insights into neuro-architecture, neuro-biochemistry and their interconnection, which are crucial for our understanding of the human brain and its disorders.",Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging,9731533,R01EB026456,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Biochemistry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Fluid', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracellular Fluid', 'Ions', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'hemodynamics', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'molecular imaging', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'prototype', 'radio frequency', 'reconstruction', 'simulation']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,622031,0.009191338462620878
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology. Early interventions crafted using these growth charts would benefit the public health by reducing the huge disability associated with psychiatric disorders and limiting the costs to society at large.",Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry,9810689,R01MH120482,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Age', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Early Intervention', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'externalizing behavior', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'learning strategy', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'portability', 'quality assurance', 'response', 'segregation', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'somatosensory', 'synergism', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2019,780855,0.04884165241665642

"Non-invasive Neuromodulation Unit (NNU) Work was conducted under clinical protocols NCT03065335 and NCT03289923. Major accomplishments for the NNU were the recruitment of additional staff, continuing to acquire research data in our collaboration with the Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch (ETPB) and expanding that collaboration to a second study just launched, continuing our initial multimodal protocol in combined TMS and talk therapy, installation and testing of neuromodulation equipment including robotic coil placement for precision cortical targeting, expanding our training of staff to include additional labs at NIH as a core function,  and continuing and expanding our healthy volunteer protocol for TMS tool development. We now have two fully functional noninvasive neuromodulation laboratories operating in the Clinical Center and are actively enrolling subjects in IRB approved trials.   Training in the safe and effective delivery of neuromodulation is one of our major functions as a Service within the Center for Multimodal Neuroimaging. We continue to provide in-service training on TMS safety, including hands-on training sessions covering the following procedures: Motor threshold determination, electromyography (EMG), Neuronavigation, simultaneous TMS/EEG to measure TMS-evoked potentials, TMS-Safety procedures, and the role of Nursing in TMS and patient management.  Our projects fall into 3 themes: 1) measuring neuroplasticity, 2) modulating neuroplasticity, 3) modeling the effects of neuromodulation and mining multi-modal datasets to discover biomarkers of rapid antidepressant response. Our projects include:  Theme I: Measuring Neuroplasticity  Mechanisms of Rapid Antidepressant Action collaboration with Drs. Zarate and Park o This project develops biomarkers of rapid antidepressant response through the addition of TMS-EMG, TMS-EEG neuroplasticity measures to the existing intramural research program on ketamine.   Concurrent fMRI-guided rTMS and cognitive therapy for the treatment of major depressive episodes o This project (which also incorporates Theme II, below) uses MEG (in collaboration with Allison Nugent (ETPB)), fMRI, and TMS/EEG to measure brain network engagement and neuroplastic changes due to multimodal TMS/CBT in depressed adults.  Theme II: Modulating Neuroplasticity  We are taking complementary approaches to modulating neuroplasticity: 1) seizure-induced neuroplasticity, 2) paired associative stimulation (PAS) and 3) novel tool development to extend the spatial and temporal specificity of noninvasive neuromodulation.   Next generation seizure therapy collaboration with Drs. Zarate, Park, Bikson, Datta o Therapeutically induced seizures exert rapid antidepressant action and are robust inducers of neurotrophic factors and neurogenesis. New technologies for focal seizure induction may improve the risk/benefit ratio by lowering cognitive side effects, and also provide the valuable scientific opportunity to examine common mechanisms across rapidly acting interventions such as ketamine.  o This project involves optimization of seizure therapy dosing, through the study of individualized low amplitude seizure therapy (iLAST), comprised of focal seizure induction with minimal current exposure to improve tolerability of seizure therapy for depression.   Cognitive Paired Associative Stimulation (C-PAS)  o PAS has been shown to strengthen synaptic efficacy within a circuit through repeated co-activation and coincident firing. We extend that approach to activate a targeted neural circuit through cognitive task performance, and couple that with simultaneous focal neuromodulation to enhance plasticity, as a means of enhancing circuit function and improving the functional-specificity of neuromodulation action. One of our projects employs fMRI-guided TMS paired with a specific form of cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of depression (in collaboration with Dr. Strauman). Another of our projects, being conducted in the form of a cooperative agreement (5U01AG050618) uses fMRI-guided TMS with simultaneous working memory training to enhance executive function in older adults (in collaboration with Drs. Appelbaum, Peterchev, and Cabeza).  Novel Tool Development TMS research has been slowed due to two fundamental problems that directly impact its usefulness. First, the space of parameters used to produce TMS is immensely large and has barely been explored.   Second, the interaction of any set of TMS parameters with any individual brain is poorly understood, and this has led to unpredictable efficacy and a large amount of inter-individual variability in TMS studies.  The purpose of this technical development protocol is to address these two fundamental deficiencies.  Our ongoing projects within this healthy volunteer protocol include:  1. Controlling ongoing cortical state during NIBS with neurofeedback. This study asks: Does controlling brain states using neurofeedback result in greater intra- and inter-individual variability in responses to TMS? The aim is to explore the use of neurofeedback to control brain state, using EEG to evaluate the cortical response to single pulses of TMS while subjects are controlling the electrophysiological state of their brain.    2. Parametric studies to optimize theta-burst stimulation (TBS). While patterned stimulation such as TBS may represent a more potent form of TMS, its effects are quite unreliable between subjects. Moreover, there has not been a parametric examination of the stimulation parameters used in TBS. We have begun with the intertrain interval as the first parameter to examine, with the aim to parametrically measure its effects on TBS response.  3. Noninvasive focal deep brain stimulation (nfDBS) We seek to establish whether TMS can reach, in a dose-dependent way, a targeted subcortical region transynaptically which is too distant for effective direct TMS stimulation, using TMS as a probe of the fronto-striatal network, a key circuit implicated in reward processing. This will be tested with the perturbation-imaging procedure of TMS/fMRI interleaving, i.e. while participants receive TMS during both resting state and task-based fMRI.    4. Transcranial direct current stimulation to reduce effects of nicotine withdrawal syndrome NIDA Protocol 12-DA-N474 (PI: E.A.Stein, collaborators: Sarah Aronson) Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal remain a major impediment for smokers trying to quit, with most quit attempts failing within the first week of abstinence when withdrawal symptoms are at their height. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has the potential to modify neuronal circuits by application of a subthreshold conductive current through the scalp. The goal is to investigate the effects of tDCS on modulating large-scale brain networks dysregulated in nicotine addiction and withdrawal.   5. Closed-loop paired associative stimulation The effects of noninvasive brain stimulation can be extremely variable across subjects. One source of this variability is known to be the state of the brain at the time of stimulation. One way of addressing this source of variability is to trigger the TMS when the brain is in an up-state or a down-state. To accomplish this, real-time signal processing is utilized to analyze the EEG and predict where the brain oscillations will be milliseconds in advance. The TMS trigger is controlled by the real-time hardware.

"A data science toolbox for analysis of Human Connectome Project diffusion MRI Project Summary/Abstract The connections between different brain regions play an important role in normal brain function. This project proposes to create an end-to-end pipeline for analysis of human white matter connections using “tractometry” methods. In tractometry, tissue properties are estimated in the long-range connections between remote brain regions. The project will focus on the analysis of the Human Connectome Project diffusion MRI dataset, which provides one of the largest available publicly available datasets of diffusion MRI from a sample of normal healthy individuals. Based on this dataset, we propose to create a normative distribution of tissue properties in the major white matter connections, to develop novel statistical methods to connect the properties of white matter connections to cognitive abilities, and to create visualization tools for further communication and exploration of the data. The tools created will be initially applied to the Human Connectome Project Dataset, but will also be useful in smaller studies on speciﬁc populations and in other large-scale datasets, such as the ABCD study. Project Narrative This project proposes to characterize the properties of long-range connections between human brain regions, using MRI data from the Human Connectome Project. Using novel data science tools that we will develop we will assemble a benchmark of the distribution of tissue properties in major brain connections, apply novel statistical methods that connect the properties of brain connections to cognitive abilities, and create visualization tools for further communication and exploration of this dataset and other similar datasets.",A data science toolbox for analysis of Human Connectome Project diffusion MRI,9886761,RF1MH121868,"['Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Funding', 'Human', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Online Systems', 'Play', 'Population', 'Problem Solving', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual impairment', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biophysical properties', 'blind', 'brain tract', 'clinical predictors', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive skill', 'connectome', 'data visualization', 'human data', 'in vivo', 'individual variation', 'member', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'open source', 'scale up', 'success', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool', 'tractography', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,RF1,2019,707444,0.01901351664873719
"Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This lack of progress is reflected in the continued excessive direct and indirect health care expenditure related to these conditions, largely in form of unnecessary diagnostic procedures to rule out ""organic"" disease and lack of novel, cost effective therapies. During the past funding cycle, we have identified functional alterations of brain networks in IBS patients, both in the resting state and in response to physical and psychological stimuli, which are related to sex, gene polymorphisms and a history of early adverse life events. These functional findings were accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of both white and grey matter in the brain of IBS patients resulting in a distinct ""brai signature"". In this revised competitive renewal application, I plan to take these insights to the next level by validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IB patients from healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome. Using an array of advanced, innovative brain imaging, genomic and microbiological techniques, I will address these goals in 3 Specific Aims: A. Identify disease- specific brain signatures of IBS, identify correlations of these signatures with behavioral and clinical parameters, and determine accuracy to predict IBS phenotype compared to HCs, and patients with chronic gut inflammation (ulcerative colitis). B. Identify gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and correlate with distinct brain signatures in IBS patients as identified in Aim A. C. Identify gut microbiome derived metabolites which correlate with brain signatures in IBS patients. The longitudinal design of the study combined with a mediator/moderator analysis approach will enable us to infer causality between brain, peripheral factors and symptoms, and will provide the basis for future mechanistic studies in animal models. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to improve our understanding of the complex bidirectional brain gut interactions of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS and identify biomarkers in order to develop more effective treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 15% of the U.S. population and leads to a substantial economic and societal burden. Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for IBS. This proposal is relevant to public health in that it is aimed at validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IBS patients fro healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome to provide the basis for mechanistic studies, advance our knowledge of IBS pathophysiology and aid future development of IBS therapies.",Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation,9773019,R01DK048351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feces', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Metadata', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visceral', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disorder control', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'monocyte', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'pain sensitivity', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,461813,0.08620936994168082

"Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation Project Summary  We are in critical need of targeted and individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affect nearly 50% of Americans during our lifetimes. Brain stimulation treatments, including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), represent the front-line of innovative approaches to correct dysfunctional brain networks for patients suffering from mental illness. rTMS is FDA-approved for depression and obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) with clinical trials underway for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use, among others. However, as currently administered, rTMS lacks a biomarker to individually optimize treatment and thus suffers from a poor clinical response rate (<50%). Without personalization of rTMS, we risk a one-size-fits-all treatment for all psychiatric disorders, not dissimilar to how antidepressants are administered.  Using simultaneous TMS and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG), I identified a depression severity biomarker from a double-blind randomized clinical trial treating depressed patients with one month of active or placebo rTMS. The degree of this biomarker change significantly predicted clinical improvement after rTMS treatment. Direct brain recordings further suggest that a single stimulation session is sufficient to modulate this biomarker, indicating that this brain-based biomarker can be monitored daily to support empiric treatment optimization.  With this in mind, I propose to develop the first broadly generalizable platform for real-time biomarker monitoring (Aim #1) and personalized rTMS treatment (Aims #2 & 3). I will enroll 54 depressed patients to participate in a cross-over, placebo-controlled study directly comparing personalized, adaptive rTMS to standard rTMS. Primary outcome will be target engagement and dose-response of the depression severity biomarker. Successful implementation of this work includes the early stratification of treatment responders and personalized and more effective treatments for non-responders. This approach is broadly applicable to other depression biomarkers, all psychiatric populations treated with rTMS, and other brain stimulation modalities. More generally, my goals are to establish the fundamental principles of human brain plasticity and to construct platforms for rapid biomarker development, engagement, and integration into personalized brain stimulation treatments. Project Narrative We need targeted, individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affects nearly 50% of Americans. Brain stimulation treatments target dysfunctional brain networks with minimal side effects but are currently applied in a one-size-fits-all manner, thus limiting its efficacy. I aim to develop a non-invasive personalized brain stimulation platform for neuropsychiatric disorders; here I will create a real-time monitoring system for brain changes, evaluate the mechanism underlying these brain changes, and develop and test an adaptive stimulation paradigm to maximally drive individual brain changes and improve clinical outcome.","Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation",9794069,DP5OD028128,"['Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Markers', 'Book Chapters', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Length', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinical predictors', 'depressed patient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'journal article', 'lectures', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'off-patent', 'placebo controlled study', 'primary outcome', 'professor', 'real time monitoring', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'side effect', 'tenure track', 'time use', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment responders', 'treatment stratification']",OD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP5,2019,391249,0.027627737548605882

Primary outcome will be target engagement and dose-response of the depression severity biomarker. Successful implementation of this work includes the early stratification of treatment responders and personalized and more effective treatments for non-responders. This approach is broadly applicable to other depression biomarkers, all psychiatric populations treated with rTMS, and other brain stimulation modalities. More generally, my goals are to establish the fundamental principles of human brain plasticity and to construct platforms for rapid biomarker development, engagement, and integration into personalized brain stimulation treatments. Project Narrative We need targeted, individualized treatments for mental health disorders, which affects nearly 50% of Americans. Brain stimulation treatments target dysfunctional brain networks with minimal side effects but are currently applied in a one-size-fits-all manner, thus limiting its efficacy. I aim to develop a non-invasive personalized brain stimulation platform for neuropsychiatric disorders; here I will create a real-time monitoring system for brain changes, evaluate the mechanism underlying these brain changes, and develop and test an adaptive stimulation paradigm to maximally drive individual brain changes and improve clinical outcome.","Closing the loop: development of real-time, personalized brain stimulation",9794069,DP5OD028128,"['Affect', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biological Markers', 'Book Chapters', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Controlled Clinical Trials', 'Department chair', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Electroencephalography', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Event', 'FDA approved', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Human', 'Human Resources', 'Incubators', 'Individual', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Laboratories', 'Legal patent', 'Length', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Mind', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Placebos', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Residencies', 'Risk', 'Secure', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Students', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Update', 'Work', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'brain circuitry', 'brain dysfunction', 'clinical predictors', 'depressed patient', 'design', 'effective therapy', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'instructor', 'journal article', 'lectures', 'neural network', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'off-patent', 'placebo controlled study', 'primary outcome', 'professor', 'real time monitoring', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'side effect', 'tenure track', 'time use', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'treatment optimization', 'treatment responders', 'treatment stratification']",OD,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,DP5,2019,1,0.027627737548605882
"Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks The mammalian brain is believed to be optimally designed for robust and adaptable computation of the sensory inputs from the world, with respect to both its hardware (network structure) and software (network dynamics). The precise connections between the intricate structural connectivity and the rich network dynamics, however, are yet unknown. Moreover, our understanding of how the network structure and dynamics shape (or are shaped by) underlying coding principles in the brain network, is limited. My research plan proposes to close this gap by leveraging rich dataset obtained by state-of-art experimental techniques at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and innovative mathematical methods.  Specifically, my project aims to 1) link network structure and dynamic information processing in the brain, and to 2) bridge the gap between detailed biophysiological mechanisms and overarching neural coding principles with a focus on predictive coding theory, using data-driven mathematical models. To address Aim 1, I will investigate how network dynamics measured by synchronizability, metastability, and integrated information depend on local and global structure of the network. I will then study whether the experimentally obtained mouse brain connectome has optimal connectivity structures for unique dynamical characteristics. These analyses will be extended to the cell-type and layer-specific brain connectivity, based on the latest Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity data obtained from Cre-transgenic mice. During the independent phase, I will investigate whether brain-like networks can be evolved from optimization of dynamic measures. Regarding Aim 2, I will analyze data obtained from my current collaborative project which experimentally tests predictive coding models in the mouse visual cortex. In this study, we measure neural activity in response to expected and unexpected sequences of natural stimuli across three hierarchically related areas. Upon completion of the experiments, during the mentored phase, I will investigate mapping of algorithmic units in predictive coding models to neuronal populations in different layers. During my independent career period, I will extend the predictive coding model to incorporate active sensing and thalamo-cortical circuitries.  The project during the mentored phase will be carried out at the University of Washington which provides a highly interdisciplinary environment and offers the ideal training for me to become an independent researcher. I will also have access to rich resources and outstanding collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. I will have two mentors, one from the University of Washington and another from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. This unique setup will allow me to study mathematical models based on experimental data obtained by cutting-edge techniques with guidance from mentors with strong theoretical backgrounds. With theories closely tied to experiments, I believe my proposed project will contribute to our understanding of the connection between structure and computation of the neuronal network, addressing BRAIN initiative’s high priorities. The proposed research aims to probe how adaptable sensory coding arises from intricate connectivity structure and dynamics of the brain network at multiple scales. This study will contribute to our understanding of connections between unique structure and dynamics of the brain network as well as the mapping of complex neuronal dynamics in the cortical circuitry to algorithmic nodes in predictive coding models. By combining cutting-edge experimental and theoretical tools, this project will contribute to identifying fundamental principles underlying emergence of cognition and perception from neuronal network dynamics.","Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks",9804370,K99EY030840,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive control', 'collaborative environment', 'connectome', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'object recognition', 'predictive test', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'theories', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2019,128619,0.027038612351685858
"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions. The starting point of the project is our earlier discovery that phase structure in oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) of hippocampal areas CA1/CA3 carry location information in exquisite detail (Agarwal et al. 2014). We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations. The computational description level will leverage ideas of vector symbolic architectures, a class of connectionist models originally proposed for describing cognitive reasoning (Plate, 1995; Kanerva, 1996). Models produced by the software tool will concisely encapsulate assumptions about the computation and its implementation of a brain function and produce predictions that can be tested in a next generation of recording experiments.

"Towards integrated 3D reconstruction of whole human brains at subcellular resolution Project Summary A detailed understanding of the anatomical and molecular architectures of brain cells and their brain-wide organization is essential for interrogating human brain function and dysfunction. Extensive efforts have been made toward mapping brain cells through various lenses, which have established invaluable databases yielding new insights. However, integrative extraction of the multimodal properties of various cell-types brain-wide within the same brain, crucial to elucidating complex intercellular relationships, remains nearly impossible. We have developed high-throughput, cost-effective technology platforms to create a fully integrated three-dimensional (3D) human brain cell atlas by simultaneously mapping high-dimensional features (e.g., spatial, molecular, morphological, and microenvironment information) of all cells acquired from the same whole brain. The proposed work will establish the most comprehensive 3D human brain map to date, with unprecedented resolution and completeness. We envision that this atlas will facilitate the integration of a broad range of studies and allow the research community to interrogate human brain structure and function at multiple levels. In Aim 1, we will apply a novel technology to transform whole human brain tissue into indestructible hydrogel–tissue hybrids that allow highly multiplexed molecular labeling and subcellular-resolution volume imaging. In Aim 2, we will apply scalable labeling and imaging technologies to map the brain-wide 3D distribution of various cell-type and structural markers at subcellular resolution within the same brain. Our chemical engineering–based approach to this aim will enable cost-effective, lossless 3D labeling of the entire human brain at lower cost as traditional subsampling approaches. True volume labeling and subcellular-resolution imaging will allow us to extract fine morphological and connectivity information from labeled cells and reconstruct the microenvironment of all cells. In Aim 3, we will use a host of rapid and highly automated algorithms to perform unbiased, integrative high- dimensional phenotyping of all cells based on their spatial location, molecular expression, morphology, and microenvironment. In Aim 4, we will perform super-resolution phenotyping of cells in a selected brain region from the same sample used in Aim 3 to map inter-areal axonal connectivity at single-fiber resolution and to characterize chemical synapses. This integrative approach will likely unveil unique cell-types and brain regions, a crucial step toward a better understanding of brain function. The complete 3D dataset will be linked to magnetic resonance and diffusion spectrum images and existing reference atlases to facilitate the integration of a wide breadth of study at multiple levels and to make the data publicly accessible for mining and analysis. A detailed picture of the human brain’s complex intermolecular, intercellular, and interareal interactions is of paramount importance for understanding its function and dysfunction. However, the immense complexity of the human brain and the absence of enabling technologies have hither-to made it impossible to interrogate these interactions brain-wide. Here we propose to use a host of new technology platforms to create a fully integrated whole human brain cell atlas with unprecedented levels of resolution and completeness.",Towards integrated 3D reconstruction of whole human brains at subcellular resolution,9768578,U01MH117072,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Axon', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'Cerebral hemisphere', 'Chemical Engineering', 'Chemical Synapse', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Custom', 'Cytoplasm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dyes', 'Fiber', 'Formalin', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Hydrogels', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Left', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Mining', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morphology', 'Mus', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Permeability', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Slice', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Thick', 'Tissues', 'Work', 'antibody libraries', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'insight', 'lens', 'macromolecule', 'molecular phenotype', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'preservation', 'reconstruction', 'spectrograph', 'two-photon']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,U01,2019,2003389,0.053993434164737904
"Automating whole brain connectomics: development, validation, and application of an open toolkit Project Summary/Abstract We have recently published a 3D electron microscopy volume of the whole fruit fly brain. However mapping of synaptic `wiring diagrams' or connectomes of neuronal circuits from this volume is currently completely manual and therefore slow. Our long-term goal is to increase understanding of how circuits process and transform information, both by accelerating connectomics mapping, and increasing the power and accessibility of analysis tools. The overall objectives in this application are to (i) provide newly available whole-brain segmentations to the user community, by extending the widely used, web-based circuit-mapping and analysis platform, CATMAID; and (ii) develop, validate, and apply new analysis tools for delivering insight into circuit structure. These objectives will be achieved through three specific aims: 1) Deploy automatic segmentations to a CATMAID server where members of the fly neurobiology community can create and manage their own collaborative projects; 2) Provide integrated, scalable, and cross-modal software for analysis of connectomes and neurogeometry; and 3) Complete proof-of-principle projects using this infrastructure, including the first whole-brain tractography database, a study of stereotypy in position, number and connectivity of tracts and identified cell types, and a complete map of microconnectivity in the calyx of the mushroom body. In Aim 1, two recently generated whole-brain segmentations of all neurites and all synaptic clefts will be skeletonized, imported into CATMAID, and provided for use by the fly neurobiologists (>20 labs immediately; the entire community shortly thereafter). In Aim 2, tools for shape-based neuron search will be integrated into CATMAID, allowing online databases of cell type morphology to assist the reconstruction workflow and find genetic driver lines for behavior and physiology experiments at the bench. Analysis software will be written for automated tractography, location of contralateral circuit element equivalents, and identification of synaptic partners. In Aim 3, this infrastructure will be used in proof-of-principle analyses designed to test and guide infrastructure development, while providing important biological contributions in their own right. The proposed research is innovative because it will: almost immediately provide segmentation-assisted circuit reconstruction to the fly community in the whole fly brain dataset; provide powerful new analysis tools; and enable individual labs to form and manage their own public or private collaborations in an expertly managed server environment. The proposed research is significant because acceleration of circuit mapping will greatly increase our understanding of information processing in the brain of an important animal model system, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster; further, these tools will be applicable to diverse brain tissues and organisms. Ultimately, this infrastructure will therefore contribute to a qualitatively improved understanding of how neuronal circuits process and store information across phyla. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it provides a new and cutting-edge strategy to accelerate mapping of brain circuits at a synaptic level, a prerequisite to understanding circuit function in normal and diseased brains. The proposed infrastructure is relevant to the part of the BRAIN Initiative's mission that pertains to revolutionizing our understanding of brain function through tool development and improved data analysis technologies.","Automating whole brain connectomics: development, validation, and application of an open toolkit",9822552,RF1MH120679,"['3-Dimensional', 'Acceleration', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Automated Annotation', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cell Count', 'Cells', 'Cerebral hemisphere', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Contralateral', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'Letters', 'Location', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Motivation', 'Mushroom Bodies', 'Neurites', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Online Systems', 'Organism', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Public Domains', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Services', 'Shapes', 'Skeleton', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'Synaptic Cleft', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'improved', 'information processing', 'infrastructure development', 'innovation', 'insight', 'light microscopy', 'member', 'microscopic imaging', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal circuitry', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'scaffold', 'stereotypy', 'tool', 'tool development', 'tractography']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,RF1,2019,1910784,0.015901769402884472
"Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma Project Summary Childhood trauma dramatically increases the risk of adult psychiatric illness and significantly alters symptom complexity and treatment outcomes. Discovering causal factors and novel interventions could have a dramatic impact on treating psychiatric illness. Over the past decade, there has been a growing appreciation for the role of the gut microbiota in normal brain development and behavior and of critical modulatory effects of the gut microbiota on mental health. Interactions of microbiota with stress-related hormonal, immune, and inflammatory processes in the brain are particularly well supported. Thus, there is intense interest in understanding how interactions among stress, microbiome, and brain (the “stress-biome-brain” axis; SBB) contribute to a significant impact on mental health. We will address the hypothesis that adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. First, we will characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics in mice following recurrent trauma. Mice exposed to recurrent predation stress or to control conditions will be assessed for changes in the gut microbiota, hippocampal gene expression, and behavior. We will use these data to construct multi-level models and predict causal interactions among stress, microbiome, brain, and behavior. Next, we will test the hypothesis that changes in the gut microbiota induced by childhood trauma have causal effects in the brain. We will perform fecal transplants from trauma-exposed mice into naïve mice and measure changes in brain gene expression. These experiments will be performed in a germ-free mouse facility in mice with a small specified number of species, for precise control of microbial content. In addition, we will test strategies for perturbation of the microbial community and to assess behavioral outcomes in the germ-free facility. The data generated will set the stage for precision perturbation studies of the microbiota and its effects on behavior and for future translational studies. Project Narrative Adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome may contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. We will conduct experiments designed to characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics using state of the art genomics and systems biology. The results will provide a ranked list of the factors predicted to drive neuronal and behavioral responses across the system and will form the framework to test their causality.",Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma,9821596,R21MH118597,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early-life trauma', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predatory Behavior', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Trauma', 'Trauma recovery', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'comparative', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fecal transplantation', 'genome sciences', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'multilevel analysis', 'network models', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'synergism', 'translational study', 'trauma exposure', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2019,231602,0.04518365764093664
"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9670105,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'adult obesity', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'immunoregulation', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'professional atmosphere', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2019,202731,0.041346660786845284
"Machine Learning Team This is the first annual report for the Machine Learning Team. We have only been fully operational since January of 2018, when Francisco Pereira was hired. Charles Zheng and Patrick McClure were hired late in 2017, and worked within the Data Science and Sharing Team (DSST) until January. In 2018, the team hosted summer interns Nao Rho and Tim Barry.  In our first few months, we concentrated on setting up the hardware and computational infrastructure for the team, and starting collaborations that were particularly well matched to our skills and interests. We also canvassed many individual researchers and trainees to understand their needs, as that is crucial for guiding our future activities.  Over the coming months, we plan to release software packages we have been working on, after testing and  documentation. Beyond that, we plan to prioritize the development of training material and workshops, in order to be able to have an impact on the work of more labs through their trainees and staff scientists. We will, in parallel, continue working on specific projects that lend themselves to the development of new methods, and joint high-impact efforts with the DSST.     Development of novel methods   One of the obstacles to the use of machine learning methods on very large datasets is the fact that many of these datasets may not be shared outside their site of origin, due to IRB constraints, sheer scale, or other factors. We developed a new method to allow the combination of prediction models -- Bayesian deep neural networks -- trained in different datasets from different sites into a single prediction model, with performance comparable to what would be obtained by having all the data in one location.    In order to study the mental representation of concrete concepts, colleagues in the NIMH IRP are collecting vast datasets of behavioral judgments. We developed a new method for creating models of mental representations that can predict the behavior of participants in face of new stimuli not used in building the model, or on a variety of new tasks.   Both of these projects have led to submitted publications (see below).    Development of software packages   We developed several software packages that were necessary for us or for the colleagues we collaborated with:  1) searchlight classification/regression models -  the purpose is to produce maps of where certain information is present in brain imaging data, as measured by the ability to predict it from new images. 2) common latent variable models -  the purpose is to wrap up several methods for identifying brain activation that is common across subjects exposed to the same stimuli, and automatically select parameter values from the data, to make the methods easier to use. 3) agglomerative clustering  the purpose is to generate a brain parcellation in a completely data-driven way, by grouping adjacent voxels with similar behavior, and determining which parcels are reliable in different groups of subjects.  In all three cases, our goal is to have the methods working fast enough to make it feasible to use them on very high-resolution functional MRI data from a 7 Tesla scanner.   Collaboration with IRP researchers   We have been helping researchers at NIMH and NINDS in projects that require machine learning tools, for instance:  - automated prediction of brain segmentations (in second rather than hours) - creation of a model of mental representations of objects that explains complex behavior  - identification of brain locations encoding a percept from high-resolution functional brain imaging data  - detection of locations and times in a video stimulus containing information about subject decision - comparison of group-level testing methods for information mapping in functional brain imaging  - comparison of the efficacy of different dynamic functional connectivity methods to capture cognitively relevant information - creation of a parcellation of the hypothalamus from very high resolution functional brain imaging data - prediction of the improvement of stroke patients after one year of follow-up, based on their condition at discharge and demographics, lab tests, treatment, and several other factors  - generating predictors for naturalistic stimuli using deep neural networks - prediction of subject characteristics from functional brain imaging data acquired while seeing naturalistic stimuli - identification of groups of neurons driving different aspects of animal behavior, from calcium imaging data - prediction of the temporal evolution trajectory of schizophrenia patients from SNP genetic data - automatic annotation of video frames in movies to identify all body parts present, to allow quantification of eye tracking patterns in ASD patients and control subjects - identification of aspects of functional connectivity that distinguish patients with motor disorders from control subjects - prediction of patient HIV status from a variety of imaging and non-imaging measures  In addition to these projects, we also provided informal guidance to researchers already using machine learning methods, in NIMH, NINDS, NIDA, NIAAA, and NCBI.

"Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome Project Summary/Abstract The high risk of neurodevelopmental impairments is a major concern for parents and clinicians caring for premature babies. Annually, approximately 22,000 very preterm infants (i.e. ≤32 weeks gestational age) in the United States develop cognitive deficits. Efforts to target interventions to prevent neurodevelopmental sequelae are hampered by our current inability to diagnose disabilities before the age of 3 to 5 years. Research supports the notion that cognitive deficits may result from a perturbation of neural connection and communication. Recent brain connectome studies in adults and older children show that abnormal network properties are useful as prognostic biomarkers. Many of these studies have exploited machine learning models based on brain connectome data for the prediction of a variety of neurological conditions, however this progress has not been fully extended to the preterm population. Our preliminary studies suggest that early and accurate prediction of cognitive deficits at an individual level is possible using machine learning models based on brain connectome features at term corrected age (CA). We have correctly classified 91.3% of very preterm infants at high risk of cognitive deficits with 90% specificity and 92.3% sensitivity. Our overall objective is to develop a robust machine learning model that can analyze integrated structural and functional brain connectome data obtained at term CA to make a prediction of later cognitive deficits in very preterm infants. Our central hypothesis is that machine learning techniques analyzing integrated structural and functional brain connectome features at birth can predict cognitive deficits at 2 years CA at an individual level in very preterm infants with accuracy of greater than 90%, exceeding the performance of current classical multivariate analyses. The two specific aims to test the central hypothesis are: 1) Develop and implement a machine learning model to extract high-level brain connectome features and 2) Develop and validate a machine learning framework to predict cognitive deficits. On completion of the first aim, we will explicate the brain connectome, and extract high-dimensional connectome features that best represent the brain connectome. In the second aim, the machine learning model we proposed will be applied in predicting both cognitive deficit (i.e. 2-class classification) and cognitive scores on a continuous scale (i.e., regression) at 2 years CA. To quantify the model's discrimination, we will also validate its performance in data that are not used for the model development, and compare with the current conventional multivariate approach. The proposed research is significant because it will increase scientific knowledge about the developing brain connectome in very preterm infants and facilitate earlier identification of babies at high risk of neurodevelopmental deficits, allowing timely clinical interventions for optimal cognitive outcome. Project Narrative Babies born before 32 weeks' gestational age are at a very high risk of developing cognitive deficits, which may impact their brain function in many ways, including life-long learning difficulties. Fortunately, infant brains are highly malleable, so it is important to identify those at highest risk as early as possible to allow effective early interventions. We propose to apply a reliable, accurate and sensitive artificial intelligence approach based on state-of-the-art brain MRI to allow identification of babies at highest risk of learning difficulties.",Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficits in Very Preterm Infants using Machine Learning and Brain Connectome,9432651,R21HD094085,"['5 year old', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Child', 'Child Rearing', 'Childhood Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discrimination', 'Early Intervention', 'Early identification', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exhibits', 'Funding', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medical', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurodevelopmental Deficit', 'Neurodevelopmental Impairment', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Outcome', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Hospitals', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Premature Infant', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Support', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States', 'Validation', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'cognitive testing', 'connectome', 'disability', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'high risk infant', 'interest', 'life-long learning', 'medical complication', 'model development', 'neonate', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'outcome prediction', 'prevent', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'sex', 'social']",NICHD,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2018,198750,0.024982880418064814

Quarles, Ph.D., Chief Scientist, The Optical Society  2010 Massachusetts Ave, NW, Washington, DC  gquarles@osa.org, 202-416-1954 Project Summary /Abstract:  The 2018 OSA Biophotonics Congress: Biomedical Optics, 3-6 April 2018, Hollywood, FL, consists of four topical meetings. Within this congress, the Optics and the Brain Conference is specifically focused on cutting-edge research and innovative new tools and techniques that seek to increase fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system. This proposal is to provide registration and travel support for students, early career professionals, and underrepresented speakers that will present on optics and the brain topics within this meeting.  The 2018 OSA Optics and the Brain conference was founded in 2015 in response to the USA BRAIN Initiative and the European Human Brain Project. These initiatives have identified the urgent need for new technologies that can probe the working brain across all levels from single neurons to entire behaving organisms. Optics offers a unique toolkit for multiscale imaging the living and intact brain, while new genetic labeling strategies provide optical contrast to neural function and optogenetics permits the control of cellular function with light. Optics and the Brain is thus an important, highly interdisciplinary area of research that combines broad aspects of neuroscience, biology, medicine, physics, chemistry and engineering. This year the program is adding more topics to be able to better explore new tools, the use of artificial intelligence in machine learning and technologies that will allow doctors to explore larger, deeper sections of the brain.  The general purpose of this congress with co-located meetings is to create an inclusive, open forum for the presentation of high-quality scientific research through plenary and technical sessions, short courses, panels, networking and special events. This method of face-to-face information sharing allows researchers to learn what others in their field and related disciplines are doing and to efficiently learn about new research, tools, and techniques that might be relevant to their work. It allows conversations with colleagues from different institutions around the world and engenders far reaching scientific collaborations – both domestic and international. In addition, this meeting provides an opportunity for students and early career professionals to present their work, participate in professional development activities, and to hear from and network with internationally-renowned invited speakers who represent the broad diversity of optics and the brain related research. Ultimately this meeting, where best-in-class research is presented and discussed will advance knowledge in the field of biomedical optics and biophotonics and propel technological development forward.

"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9486921,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'early detection biomarkers', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'personalized predictions', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,549838,0.07267662658767331
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9493548,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2018,163943,0.04543564662506513
"Assessing the Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation on Agency Project Summary Recent advances in neurotechnologies have provided us with the ability to modulate brain function by direct and indirect interventions. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is one such intervention that has already been FDA-approved for certain disorders, and its use has already raised ethical questions about ways in which direct brain stimulation may affect personal identity, autonomy, authenticity and, more generally, agency. Thus far the neuroethical worries have been largely based on anecdotal clinical reports. Further neurotechnological interventions developed as part of the BRAIN initiative are bound to raise similar questions, but we lack a clear framework in which to think of the ethical consequences of these interventions. The overall goal of this project is to articulate such a framework, to enable us to better evaluate and respond to the neuroethical challenges raised by our abilities to alter brain function. The more concrete objectives of our proposal are to 1) develop comprehensive assessment tools to measure changes in agency due to direct brain interventions, 2) to use this tool to assess changes in agency due to brain interventions using DBS patient populations as a test case; and 3) to develop a database to house the data we acquire with these tools to allow us to catalogue the effects and side effects of DBS. This will also make it possible to correlate the effects of DBS with electrode placement and white matter tractography, enabling better prediction of outcomes and aid in understanding of the mechanisms by which DBS works. We will analyze this data machine with machine learning methods to inform a more comprehensive neuroethical analysis of how brain interventions affect agency. Our approach is innovative in that it applies neurophilosophical insights about agency and employs deep learning algorithms in constructing and evaluating these assessment instruments. This contribution is significant in that it will provide a broad based assessment tool and database that will be a resource for researchers and clinicians using DBS, which could be used to improve therapeutic approaches and informed consent. The data will also inform a framework for further neuroethical thought about brain interventions, allowing us to better identify, articulate and measure changes on “dimensions of agency.” Finally, the approach is generalizable, and thus could be adapted for use with other brain intervention techniques, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) or pharmacological treatments.   Project Narrative: We aim to develop a computerized assessment tool (the Agency Assessment Tool, AAT) to be used by clinicians prior to and after brain interventions to measure changes in agency along multiple dimensions.

"Assessing the Effects of Deep Brain Stimulation on Agency Project Summary Recent advances in neurotechnologies have provided us with the ability to modulate brain function by direct and indirect interventions. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is one such intervention that has already been FDA-approved for certain disorders, and its use has already raised ethical questions about ways in which direct brain stimulation may affect personal identity, autonomy, authenticity and, more generally, agency. Thus far the neuroethical worries have been largely based on anecdotal clinical reports. Further neurotechnological interventions developed as part of the BRAIN initiative are bound to raise similar questions, but we lack a clear framework in which to think of the ethical consequences of these interventions. The overall goal of this project is to articulate such a framework, to enable us to better evaluate and respond to the neuroethical challenges raised by our abilities to alter brain function. The more concrete objectives of our proposal are to 1) develop comprehensive assessment tools to measure changes in agency due to direct brain interventions, 2) to use this tool to assess changes in agency due to brain interventions using DBS patient populations as a test case; and 3) to develop a database to house the data we acquire with these tools to allow us to catalogue the effects and side effects of DBS. This will also make it possible to correlate the effects of DBS with electrode placement and white matter tractography, enabling better prediction of outcomes and aid in understanding of the mechanisms by which DBS works. We will analyze this data machine with machine learning methods to inform a more comprehensive neuroethical analysis of how brain interventions affect agency. Our approach is innovative in that it applies neurophilosophical insights about agency and employs deep learning algorithms in constructing and evaluating these assessment instruments. This contribution is significant in that it will provide a broad based assessment tool and database that will be a resource for researchers and clinicians using DBS, which could be used to improve therapeutic approaches and informed consent. The data will also inform a framework for further neuroethical thought about brain interventions, allowing us to better identify, articulate and measure changes on “dimensions of agency.” Finally, the approach is generalizable, and thus could be adapted for use with other brain intervention techniques, such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) or pharmacological treatments.   Project Narrative: We aim to develop a computerized assessment tool (the Agency Assessment Tool, AAT) to be used by clinicians prior to and after brain interventions to measure changes in agency along multiple dimensions.

"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9422606,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'computerized tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'predictive modeling', 'public health relevance', 'serial imaging', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,451650,0.009653076277742822
"Deep Learning for Connectomics Project Summary/Abstract The brain contains a vast number of neurons that are connected with each other through synapses, thereby forming a complex anatomical network that mediates information ﬂow within the brain. The brain “wiring diagram” will be a foundational tool for elucidating the function and dysfunction of brains. Electron microscopy (EM) is widely considered to be the gold standard for neuronal level circuit recon- struction. Currently, a major and serious bottleneck in this ﬁeld is image segmentation and reconstruc- tion. It is estimated that the data analysis accuracy and throughput are lagging behind data acquisition by orders of magnitude. This project aims at dramatically improving the accuracy and throughput of brain EM image analysis, thereby enabling accurate and efﬁcient reconstruction of neuronal level brain maps. Speciﬁcally, this project is built up on the recent success in deep learning methods, which are dominant tools for EM image analysis. A central and unresolved challenge of using deep learning for segmentation is how to achieve the conﬂicting goals of integrating sufﬁcient contextual features while preserving full-resolution information. This project will develop a novel residual encoder-decoder model to achieve these two goals simultaneously (Aim 1). In current deep learning segmentation methods, the labels of each pixel are predicted independently. To fully consider the brain topological structure and couple the predictions of spatially adjacent pixels, this project will develop a hybrid recurrent and convo- lutional network model (Aim 2). In this model, the recurrent network is integrated with the convolutional network to incorporate the multi-dimensional structural information. When combined with Aim 1, these methods are expected to dramatically improve the accuracy of EM image segmentation. In most cur- rent deep learning segmentation methods, the training and/or prediction stages require the extraction of patches centered on each pixel. This step forms a bottleneck that limits the overall throughput. This project will develop novel techniques to achieve whole-image training and prediction (Aim 3). These approaches will enable very efﬁcient training and segmentation, thereby dramatically increasing the throughput of EM image analysis. Project narrative Wiring diagrams of the brain circuits serve as a foundational tool for studying brain function and dys- function. This project aims at developing advanced computational methods for boosting the accuracy and throughput of brain circuit reconstruction from electron microscopy images.

"Construction of a high-resolution human tractography atlas and its related toolbox PROJECT SUMMARY Mapping the human connectome and exploring its characteristics is one of the largest endeavors in the neuroscience field, but a detailed tractography atlas that provides the 3D trajectories in a standard space has yet to be constructed and validated. A tractography atlas can provide neuroanatomical insight into the structural organization of the human brain and allow for modeling, simulation, and confirmation of cortical connections to facilitate the new development of treatment and intervention for brain diseases. In this study, we propose to construct a high spatial and angular resolution tractography atlas using a large sample of the Human Connectome Project (HCP) diffusion MRI data, averaging them into a template for fiber tracking, validating the tracks by post-mortem Klingler microdissection on 100 cadavers under a neurosurgery microscope digitized using high resolution 3D scanners, and building a deep learning toolbox that allows for automatic track recognition in individuals. This study will construct the most detailed and accurate tractography of human connectome and provide a novel toolbox for future HCP data analysis. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will construct an atlas of human brain fiber pathways and a related toolbox for track- specific analysis, aiming to understand the structural characteristics of brain connections in healthy individuals and provide track-specific analysis for brain imaging data.",Construction of a high-resolution human tractography atlas and its related toolbox,9771640,R56MH113634,"['Algorithms', 'Aphasia', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Autopsy', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain scan', 'Cadaver', 'Cerebellum', 'Characteristics', 'Complement', 'Cranial Nerves', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fiber', 'Future', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Memory', 'Microdissection', 'Microscope', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Records', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Thinking', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain research', 'clinical application', 'connectome', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'digital', 'experience', 'human data', 'human subject', 'insight', 'models and simulation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tractography', 'virtual', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R56,2018,452250,0.03895193476181142
"Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Project Summary/Abstract: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Brain monitoring in critical care has grown dramatically over the past 20 years with the discovery that a large proportion of ICU patients suffer from subclinical seizures and seizure-like electrical events, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), detectable only by electroencephalography (EEG). This growth has created a crisis in critical care: It is clear that IIICAs damage the brain and cause permanent neurologic disability. Yet detection of IIICAs by expert visual review is often delayed suggesting we need better tools for real-time monitoring, to cope with the deluge of ICU EEG data. In other cases, IIICAs appear to be harmless epiphenomena, and many worry that increased awareness of IIICAs has created an epidemic of overly-aggressive prescribing of anticonvulsant drugs leading to preventable adverse events and costs. This crisis highlights critical unmet needs for automated EEG monitoring for IIICAs, and a better understanding of which types of IIICAs cause neural injury and warrant intervention. Causes of IIICAs range widely, from primary brain injuries like hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, to systemic medical illnesses like sepsis and uremia. Until recently, this massive clinical heterogeneity has been an insurmountable barrier to understanding the impact of IIICAs on neurologic outcome. However, recent advances in deep learning, coupled with the unprecedented availability of a massive dataset developed by our team over the last three years, makes it feasible for the first time to systematically study the relationship between IIICAs and neurologic outcomes. To meet the need for better monitoring tools and better models for understanding IIICAs, we will take a deep learning approach to leverage the as-yet untapped information in a massive ICU EEG dataset. We will pursue three Specific Aims: SA1: Comprehensively label all occurrences of IIICAs in a massive set of cEEG recordings, thus preparing the EEG data for training computers to detect IIICA patterns; SA2: Develop supervised DL algorithms to detect IIICAs as accurately as human experts, thus providing powerful tools for both research on IIICAs and for clinical brain monitoring; SA3: Estimate the effect of IIICAs on neurologic outcome: we will develop models to quantify effects of IIICAs on risk for disability after controlling for inciting illness and other clinical factors, and to predict effects of interventions to suppress IIICAs. This work will provide four crucial benefits to advance the field of precision critical care neurology, and by extension, our ability to provide optimal neurologic care for patients during critical illness. 1) Improved understanding of the clinical significance of seizure like IIICA states; 2) development of robust tools and algorithms for critical care brain telemetry; 3) a unique, massive, publicly available, thoroughly annotated dataset that will enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials. Project Narrative: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum RELEVANCE: Seizures and seizure-like brain activity, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), occur commonly in electroencephalogram recordings of brain activity in ICU patients, and simultaneously represent a preventable cause of brain injury and a common cause of over-treatment and iatrogenic harm to patients. Big Data and deep learning approaches have recently enabled advances in several fields of medicine, but have so far had little impact in ICU neuromedicine. This project will use Big Data and Deep Learning to advance the goal of protecting brain health in ICU patients, by 1) providing improved understanding of the clinical significance of IIICA states; 2) developing robust tools and algorithms for ICU brain telemetry; 3) creating a unique, massive, publicly available, annotated dataset to enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) developing a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials.",Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum,9574149,R01NS107291,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthetics', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Label', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurology', 'Nomenclature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Supervision', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uremia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'brain health', 'causal model', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intervention effect', 'learning strategy', 'nerve injury', 'neurophysiology', 'overtreatment', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'real time monitoring', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2018,579883,-0.03167724383398037
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Abstract (of the Parent Award) Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. This administrative supplement proposes to add a sample of unaffected siblings (n=100, 20 per site over four years) as an additional comparison sample to the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control (HC) subjects already being studied in the parent study. These siblings will complete the same clinical, neurocognitive, and imaging measures as the 250 OCD and 250 healthy control subjects complete in the parent study.",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9689131,R01MH113250,"['Administrative Supplement', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Country', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modality', 'Modernization', 'Netherlands', 'Neurocognitive', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Parents', 'Performance', 'Protocols documentation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Siblings', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Symptoms', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive task', 'disability', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'morphometry', 'neuroimaging', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,213060,0.05509760107958863
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION PROJECT DESCRIPTION Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our proposal promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art “Connectome Skyra”, an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity.

"Development of brain-computer interface methods to influence brain dynamics in stuttering Project summary Brain dynamics that drive variability within and between patients are an important, but poorly understood, element of many cognitive disorders. The long-term goal of this research project is to develop technology that will identify brain activity patterns associated with successful performance on a given task, and use this pattern as a target for brain-computer interface (BCI) training. The overarching hypothesis is that using BCI training to more often have a brain state that is spontaneously correlated to good performance will, in turn, improve overall performance. This approach could be developed into a powerful tool for rehabilitation and therapy for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here we will investigate persistent developmental stuttering (PDS) as a model to study brain dynamics associated with successful vs. unsuccessful performance. PDS is a speech disorder where fluent speech is punctuated to various degrees by stuttering. Individuals with PDS are otherwise neurologically in the normal range, which avoids complicating factors in most patient populations. Stuttering is intermittent; thus on some occasions the brain is in a state conducive to fluent speech and at other times it is not. We propose to use EEG activity shortly before speaking to predict whether somebody with PDS will stutter or speak fluently. Preliminary data are given to show proof of concept with traditional EEG analysis methods. This approach will be expanded by first using advanced methods such as common spatial pattern analysis and machine learning over multiple subject sessions to identify EEG signals that distinguish fluent vs. dysfluent trials (Aim 1). PDS subjects will then be trained to produce and maintain their EEG pattern that is most strongly associated with fluent speech by using BCI methods. We hypothesize that individuals will learn to modulate EEG features to be more consistent with fluent trials, which in turn will significantly reduce stuttering rate. After successful completion of this project we envision a new BCI-based intervention that can be used to encourage neural states conducive to fluent speech in those who stutter. The BCI intervention would complement traditional speech therapy using behavioral methods. The “two-step approach” of first identifying brain states associated with a patient’s best performance followed by BCI training to enter that state more often can be applied to rehabilitation in many other neurological and psychiatric disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, traumatic brain injury, and mood disorders, to name a few. Project narrative The goal of this project is to develop brain-computer interface technology to optimize brain function on an individual basis. This could have therapeutic applications to many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, and traumatic brain injury.",Development of brain-computer interface methods to influence brain dynamics in stuttering,9530270,R21DC016353,"['Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Complement', 'Control Groups', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Stuttering', 'Electroencephalography', 'Elements', 'Failure', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Mental disorders', 'Metaphor', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Names', 'Neurologic', 'Normal Range', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research Project Grants', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speech', 'Speech Disorders', 'Speech Therapy', 'Stroke', 'Stuttering', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'base', 'brain computer interface', 'improved', 'indexing', 'motor control', 'nervous system disorder', 'patient population', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'tool', 'visual feedback']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS SAN ANTONIO,R21,2018,216658,-0.03807720415297681
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9564206,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,465508,0.026134895889723193
"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment. Our rapid and easily multiplexed platform has great potential for non-invasive diagnostics and monitoring of both secondary injury progression and drug efficacy, offers tremendous benefits for patients.",A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles,9630167,R21MH118170,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Astrocytes', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Models', 'Blinded', 'Blood', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain', 'Brain Concussion', 'Brain Edema', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Car Phone', 'Caring', 'Cell Line', 'Cellular Phone', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Color', 'Data', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Evaluation', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Injury', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Monitor', 'Neurons', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Plasma', 'Process', 'Production', 'RNA', 'RNA Probes', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recovery', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Seizures', 'Severities', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Stream', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'United States', 'Vesicle', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'biomarker discovery', 'brain cell', 'cell type', 'cost', 'design', 'digital', 'disability', 'drug efficacy', 'endophenotype', 'exosome', 'extracellular vesicles', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'individual response', 'injured', 'injury and repair', 'innovation', 'innovative technologies', 'manufacturability', 'medical attention', 'microRNA biomarkers', 'microchip', 'mild traumatic brain injury', 'molecular marker', 'mouse model', 'nanomagnetic', 'nanoscale', 'neuropathology', 'next generation', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'nucleic acid detection', 'outcome forecast', 'point of care', 'precision medicine', 'predict clinical outcome', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'ratiometric', 'research clinical testing', 'response to injury', 'technology development', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R21,2018,206809,0.02992762332698358
"Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis PROJECT SUMMARY During adolescence, the human brain undergoes marked structural and functional refinements to support rapid cognitive and behavioral development. However, the relationship between developing white matter architecture and emergent functional connectivity remains poorly understood. It is imperative to elucidate developmental mechanisms underlying structure-function coupling in youth, as devastating mental disorders such as psychosis have been linked to the disruption of evolving brain connectivity during this epoch. Specifically, psychosis has been characterized by the anomalous functional integration of brain processes. This could result from the aberrant wiring of white matter connections during brain development, from aberrant processes of functional plasticity (activity-dependent myelination of axons linking neurons within functionally-relevant circuits), or both. This proposal will apply cutting-edge network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal neuroimaging and rich clinical phenotyping data acquired as a part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (n=503, ages 9-25 years old), a large community-based study of brain development. Moreover, the goal of this proposal is to (1) systematically characterize whether structural connectivity drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within brain modules, or vice versa, and (2) identify abnormalities of structure-function coupling associated with the longitudinal burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. This work will test the overarching hypothesis that structural connectivity precedes and drives developmental changes in functional connectivity within distinct brain modules, and further, that the aberrant development of structure-function coupling will be associated with increased burden of psychosis spectrum symptoms. Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide critical new insights regarding both typical brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental etiology of psychosis. Notably, as diverse types of psychopathology are increasingly linked to atypical brain maturation, findings generated by this study could lead to earlier diagnosis and enhanced treatment for individuals at risk for developing mental disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE It remains largely unknown how human white matter connectivity develops during adolescence to support brain function, and how abnormalities of structure-function coupling during this critical period may presage major psychiatric illnesses such as psychosis. By applying sophisticated network science and machine learning tools to longitudinal diffusion and functional neuroimaging data (n=503, ages 9-25 years), this study will provide important new insights regarding both healthy brain maturation and the neurodevelopmental underpinnings of psychosis. The findings generated by this study may allow for the development of earlier and more effective treatments for psychosis, which would benefit public health by reducing the great disability and cost associated with psychosis in youth.",Mapping normal developmental coupling between structural and functional brain networks and abnormalities associated with psychosis,9610925,F31MH115709,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Neurons', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Public Health', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'adolescent brain development', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'complex biological systems', 'cost', 'critical period', 'disability', 'early childhood', 'effective therapy', 'executive function', 'functional plasticity', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'myelination', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'recruit', 'relating to nervous system', 'theories', 'tool', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F31,2018,44524,0.06397220228900925
"White Matter Connectivity and Network Analysis In a long term project with investigators from the Nervous System Development and Plasticity Section, NICHD, and the Program on Pediatric Imaging and Tissue Sciences (PPITS), NICHD we study the dynamic regulation of myelin by the surrounding glial cells and show that it is dependent on the level of activity present in an axon. We elucidated the biological mechanisms by which astrocytes regulate this process and use a theoretical framework to predict how the changes in myelin thickness, as well as the increase in the nodal width, affects the propagation of the signals along a myelinated axon, and to experimentally measure conduction speeds using a data analysis framework we implemented. The theoretical and experimental results were in a very good agreement. A manuscript describing these methods and ultimately the mechanism of the dynamic myelin regulation is in the final phases of revision in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.   We also developed different models of myelin plasticity, or generally, delay plasticity in which we show how the stability of the synchronized state in the network, as well as general stability of the system, relies on having such adaptive delay. The consequences of such adaptive time delays are studied for three main cases: a) where the plasticity is activity-dependent; b) where the plasticity depends on the time arrivals of the postsynaptic and presynaptic action potentials; and c) where the plasticity depends on the oligodendrocytes myelinated multiple axons. For (a), we studied the effect of activity-dependent adaptive time delays on the stability of the system of coupled oscillators, with its implications on the stability of the oscillations and synchrony in the brain, while b) and c) are studied in terms of synchronization in the spiking neural networks. A manuscript describing this work is in preparation.  In a project with investigators of the Section on Behavioral Neurogenetics in the Intramural Research Program at NICHD, we study patterns of gene expression in developing zebrafish using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods and develop a framework for automated annotation of the zebrafish brain neuroanatomy. This work will allow the production of maps with increasingly fine-grained segmentation of distinct neuronal cell types and has been published in the journal Methods in the spring of 2018.   Together with several other principal investigators from NIH (NICHD, NINDS, and NIMH), we continue research under the recently obtained R24 BRAIN Initiative grant (""In Vivo Brain Network Latency Mapping""). The goal of this effort is to measure the temporal latencies (i.e., the time delays) in a human brain signaling between different regions. Being able to measure the latency information in vivo can provide a great diagnostic tool for a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Our experimental protocol consists of four different imaging modalities: diffusion MRI, providing the structural information, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) which provides dynamic and functional information. One of the results is the development of the algorithms for extracting latency information from the time series data and this work is to be presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in San Diego, CA, in November of 2018. n/a",White Matter Connectivity and Network Analysis,9773526,ZIACT000275,"['Action Potentials', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Astrocytes', 'Automated Annotation', 'Axon', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Childhood', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Electroencephalography', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Grain', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Journals', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuscripts', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monoclonal Antibody R24', 'Myelin', 'National Institute of Child Health and Human Development', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nodal', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Phase', 'Preparation', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Production', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Societies', 'Speed', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'United States National Academy of Sciences', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Width', 'Work', 'Zebrafish', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'cell type', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo', 'learning strategy', 'meetings', 'nervous system development', 'neurogenetics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'postsynaptic', 'presynaptic', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'white matter']",CIT,CENTER  FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY,ZIA,2018,250781,0.016209628825131904
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9442865,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'source localization', 'surgery outcome']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2018,531286,0.032492737007987896
"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Integrating human connectomics and brain imaging genomics offers enormous potential, allowing us to perform systems biology approaches of the brain to better understand the interplay between genes, brain connectivity, and phenotypic outcomes (e.g., cognition, behavior, disorder). This proposal seeks to develop novel bioinformatics methods and software tools for integrative study of human connectomics and brain imaging genomics. These methods and tools can be applied to: (1) study normal brain functions to impact biomedical research in general, and (2) study brain disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics,9482419,R01EB022574,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'base', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'functional outcomes', 'genetic architecture', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning outcome', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phenotypic data', 'public health relevance', 'software systems', 'tool', 'tractography', 'trait', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2018,455772,0.033782458961269905
"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and machine learning algorithms in the future.   Project Narrative The Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive) is a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects.",A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive,9565669,R24MH114788,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioconductor', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Familiarity', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Personnel Staffing', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'cloud storage', 'complex R', 'computerized data processing', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data resource', 'data submission', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'member', 'multiple omics', 'neural circuit', 'next generation', 'online resource', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'repository', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'web site', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2018,1293101,0.07177029364020453
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9503781,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2018,675630,0.059799634978958204
"Functional Dissection of Prenatal Drug Effects on the Developing Brain and Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY Despite efforts of prevention and education programs, licit and illicit drug use among pregnant women remains prevalent1. Most drugs of abuse easily cross the placenta and can alter the intricate balance among fetal neurotransmitters and receptors, which critically dictate in utero development of the brain's functional wiring system2-5. Therefore prenatal drug exposures (PDE) have long-lasting implications for brain and behavioral development since a small perturbation to the immature brain circuits may cascade into substantial deviations during long-term growth6. Existing behavioral studies provide converging evidence on the detrimental effects of PDE throughout development 1,6,7 but mechanistic studies of the brain basis of PDE remains scarce, especially during the infancy period. Nevertheless, studying the brain mechanisms of PDE during infancy is critical and urgently needed given that: 1) the infancy period immediately follows PDE insults and features the most dynamic postnatal brain development; 2) the infancy period is least confounded by postnatal environmental adversities that frequently accompany PDE; 3) identification of brain alterations associated with PDE during this stage has the best potential to guide early preventive intervention before behavioral problems onset. Our previous results8,9 demonstrated significant and widespread functional connectivity alterations in neonates prenatally exposed to cocaine and marijuana, respectively. However, three major areas need to be better delineated: 1) an overall picture of PDE effects on whole brain functional organization is lacking; 2) a more systematic delineation of the potential differential drug effects and their interactions is needed given the multi- drug exposure for most of the drug-abusing mothers; 3) the prediction power of detected neonatal functional alterations for later behavioral outcomes remains to be determined. Our long-term goal is to derive early functional-connectivity-based brain biomarkers for different PDEs that will reliably predict long-term behavioral outcomes. Our goal in this project is to derive neonate-based functional connectivity signatures for different PDEs and test their prediction power for 3-month behavioral outcomes. This project is significant because it is expected to be the first to identify drug-specific neurophenotypes for different PDEs on early brain functional and behavioral development, prior to the damaging postnatal influences that may accompany parental drug abuse. It is innovative because: 1) It will integrate resting-state brain functional connectivity and cognitive and behavioral function to quantify the potential drug-specific and drug-common effects on brain and behavior development in neonates; 2) It will apply detailed multi-level whole brain survey to discern differential drug-effect profiles and leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to better characterize their link with later behavioral outcomes. It is relevant to public health because it will provide currently unavailable knowledge of PDE effects on developing brain functional networks in neonates and inform earlier interventions that are documented to be most effective before symptom onset. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our long-term goal is to derive early functional-connectivity-based brain biomarkers for different PDEs that will reliably predict long-term behavioral outcomes.

"Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity Project Summary Prescription opioids, e.g., oxycodone (OXY), are commonly encountered in youth and pose a significant public health problem. In addition, there are significant individual differences in subjective responses to opioids which contribute to vulnerabilities for misuse. However, little is understood about OXY's effects on brain function, or on how individual differences in these effects might relate to variations in subjective responses. Assessment of OXY's effects on brain function is critical to understanding its abuse liability a n d will provide insight into how and why this drug leads to misuse and abuse/dependence in some, but not all, individuals. This proposal will assess the effects of low-dose OXY (10mg) on whole-brain functional connectivity (FC), and explore relationships with subjective responses in healthy young adults (ages 21 to 30 years, N=40) with limited prior opioid exposure. OXY's effects on FC during both reward- processing and resting-state will be assessed using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design incorporating multiband fMRI scanning. Subjective measures of drug response (e.g., `drug liking') will be collected before, during and after neuroimaging using NIDA PhenX measures. Neuroimaging data will be analyzed using data-driven methods to facilitate assessment of OXY's effects on FC both within hypothesized networks (e.g., salience and reward networks) as well as on patterns of between- network connectivity. Specifically, FC changes following OXY versus placebo (Aim 1) and relationships between these changes and subjective drug responses (Aim 2) will be assessed using intrinsic connectivity distribution (ICD). ICD is a data-driven, voxel-to-voxel method of assessing whole-brain connectivity patterns that is not limited by specification of seed regions or connectivity thresholds. In addition, connectome-based machine-learning will be used to build a predictive model of subjective responses to OXY using data acquired during placebo scans (Aim 3). This project will for the first time assess the effects of a prescription opioid on whole-brain FC. Understanding OXY's effects on large-scale network dynamics is crucial for understanding its abuse liability, and will guide future studies of OXY in addicted and at-risk populations. Identification of networks that are predictive of subjective responses to OXY is an essential first step toward finding a reliable biomarker of opioid response that will help to identify individuals at highest risk for misuse. Project Narrative Prescription opioids are commonly encountered and, in a small proportion of individuals, may be a precursor to heroin initiation. This project will assess the effects of low-dose oxycodone (10mg) on brain function in healthy young adults (age 21 to 30 years). It will identify brain-based predictors of subjective opioid responses (`neural fingerprints') that can be used to inform prevention and intervention efforts.",Effects of oxycodone on functional connectivity,9507053,R21DA045969,"['21 year old', 'Abstinence', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Model', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Cocaine', 'Complex', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Crossover Design', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Dose', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Fingerprint', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Heroin', 'Heroin Users', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'Link', 'Lobule', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methods', 'Morphine', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neurocognitive', 'Opioid', 'Oxycodone', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Placebos', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Questionnaires', 'Randomized', 'Reporting', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Spin Labels', 'System', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'connectome', 'executive function', 'financial incentive', 'functional MRI scan', 'high risk', 'indexing', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid misuse', 'predictive modeling', 'prescription opioid', 'prescription opioid misuse', 'putamen', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'reward processing', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'young adult']",NIDA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,209375,0.04011026246688583
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9534190,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,668364,0.05765656405107311
"Quantifying the role of the connectome in resiliency to multiple sclerosis MS damages white matter pathways that connect brain regions, i.e. the structural connectome (SC), disrupting flow of electrical signals, i.e. the functional connectome (FC), causing cognitive and physical disability. Howev- er, the burden of disease in the brain is not always proportional to an individual's disability. How the brain com- pensates for damage in resilient patients remains a mystery, making it difficult to develop accurate prognoses and treatments that can leverage this process in less fortunate patients. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to create individualized therapies based on the brain's natural resiliency mechanism or to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery. The thriving field of brain connectivity network analysis, or con- nectomics, provides a promising tool with which to capture, model and understand mechanisms of resiliency. The long-term goal is to develop novel, personalized rehabilitation methods that mimic and enhance the brain's resiliency process to restore cognitive and physical abilities after damage due to neurological conditions. The overall objective of this work is to identify connectome-based imaging biomarkers of resiliency in MS, i.e. those that separate patients with high disease burden and low disability (high-adapters) from those with similar dis- ease burden and high disability (low-adapters). Our central hypothesis, the functional rerouting hypothesis, states that resilient patients' brains recover from injury by restoring normal functional connections using alter- nate white matter pathways to circumvent irrevocably damaged structural connections. This hypothesis is based on published and preliminary work in simulated studies, severe brain injury and mild to moderate trau- matic brain injury. The rationale for the proposed research is that insight into the brain's ability to compensate for injury would allow for more accurate prognostication and enable the development of novel therapeutic strategies for MS. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: to identify global and regional metrics of the 1) structural and functional connectomes and 2) structure- function relationship between the connectomes that differentiate high-adapting and low-adapting MS patients. We will collect functional, diffusion and anatomical MRIs from 25 controls and 42 high- and 42 low-adapting MS patients to extract structural and functional connectomes and test central hypotheses. The approach is in- novative, in the applicant's opinion, as it implements cutting-edge machine learning techniques and a novel mathematical model to formalize the relationship between structural and functional connectomes and capture network-level functional rerouting in resiliency to MS-related damage. The proposed research is significant in that it is expected to have broad translational impact on the development of more accurate prognoses as well as targeted, personalized treatments for patients with MS and other neurological disorders. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to open up new horizons for innovative therapies, e.g. through non-invasive brain stimulation, that can dramatically improve the quality of life for patients with debilitating neurological disease. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying resiliency to multiple sclerosis related damage is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Quantifying the role of the connectome in resiliency to multiple sclerosis,9572444,R21NS104634,"['Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive disability', 'connectome', 'disability', 'driving force', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'individualized medicine', 'insight', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'repaired', 'resilience', 'response', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2018,211875,0.015724315710398565
"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9774474,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Eye', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biomarker development', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2018,200616,-0.00685842877257925
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood.

"Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging Project Summary. Neuroimaging is poised to take a substantial leap forward in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of human behavior, due to a combination of improved analytic techniques and the quality of imaging data. These advances are allowing researchers to develop population-level multivariate models of the functional brain representations underlying behavior, performance, clinical status and prognosis, and other outcomes. Population-based models can identify patterns of brain activity, or `signatures', that can predict behavior and decode mental states in new individuals, producing generalizable knowledge and highly reproducible maps. These signatures can capture behavior with large effect sizes, and can be used and tested across research groups. However, the potential of such signatures is limited by neuroanatomical constraints, in particular individual variation in functional brain anatomy. To circumvent this problem, current models are either applied only to individual participants, severely limiting generalizability, or force participants' data into anatomical reference spaces (atlases) that do not respect individual functional topology and boundaries. Here we seek to overcome this shortcoming by developing new topological models for inter-subject alignment, which register participants' functional brain maps to one another. This will increase effective spatial resolution, and more importantly allow us to explicitly analyze the spatial topology of functional maps make inferences on differences in activation location and shape across persons and psychological states. We will test and validate the methods using a purpose-designed experiment (n = 120) that includes two types of naturalistic narrative experiences (movies and audio stories) and tasks from three functional domains (pain, emotion, and cognition). The tasks are designed with several constraints in mind, including: (1) systematic coverage of cognitive, emotional, and sensory tasks matched in stimulus properties (e.g., stimulus duration); and (2) multiple levels of task demand within each task, to permit parametric modeling and prediction of demand levels. We will compare our new methods to existing methods based on out-of-sample effect sizes in predicting behavior and test-retest reliability. We will make the analytic methods, software, and dataset available to other researchers, along with a library of functional reference spaces for multiple psychological states. Project Narrative. We develop new methods for enhancing the development of models that can predict behavior, clinical status, and other outcomes using neuroimaging data. Successful development will help improve the translational impact of neuroimaging. It will also contribute to developing multidisciplinary neuroscience, by promoting the development of neural signatures for specific mental processes in humans with increased precision and specificity.",Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging,9577381,R01EB026549,"['Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Charon', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gaussian model', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Processes', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Wages', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'mental state', 'model development', 'movie', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'statistics', 'translational impact']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,710896,0.025591388784918585
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9524072,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,724280,0.035585174303711324
"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three‐dimensional (3D) whole‐brain imaging of non‐transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole‐brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole‐brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo‐bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide‐spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state‐of‐the‐art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large‐scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,9559081,R44MH116827,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion Investigative Technique', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2018,556615,0.02662937996184
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Brain aging is a global health concern and a major focus of dozens of large scale research initiatives around the world. Here, we propose a paradigm to use advanced brain imaging techniques in a harmonized fashion across numerous existing datasets, and to map the underlying genetic influences driving neurodegeneration across tens of thousands of individuals.

"CRCNS: Common algorithmic strategies used by the brain for labeling points in high-dimensional space The first major goal of this work is to learn how certain brain regions (olfactory system,  hippocampus, and cerebellum) learn very complex stimuli that employ a combinatorial code to  identify stimuli as points in a high-dimensional space. For example, the simple fruit fly  olfactory system uses the firing rates of 50 different types of odorant receptors to  identify each odor by placing it at a point in a SO-dimensional space. Although the fly olfactory  system is well understood, less is known about analogous regions in vertebrate brains, and our  goal is to begin to learn about these other regions. The first step is to start with the mouse olfactory system that is similar to the fly in some ways but has complexities that are  absent in insects. These complexities include an enhanced ability to handle noise in the  odor and to learn over time to discriminate between very similar odors (e.g., two types of  red wines). Preliminary evidence shows that it should be possible to learn the role of  these complexities in vertebrate olfaction. The research design involves studying the  anatomy and recording the firing rates of different types of neurons at different levels of the  mouse olfactory system and in applying computational methods and algorithms that have  proved successful in earlier work to describe these complexities. The second major goal is to use insights into how these brain regions operate to improve the  function of computer algorithms. For a long time, a dream of many neuroscientists and computer  scientists has been to understand how the brain works well enough that we could translate insights  from the brain to improve machine computation. Indeed, experience has shown that the brain   has evolved novel variations of information processing algorithms used by computer  scientists to solve general computational problems. With sufficient insight into algorithms  used by the brain, these insights may provide unexpected ways to improve the function computer  science algorithms. Further, understanding the circuit mechanisms involved in olfactory processing can help illuminate the basis of a variety of smell disorders, and may  in the future lead to the construction of artificial smelling devices. Our main goal is to understand what computations are used by the mammalian olfactory system; this  has two types of public relevance. First, we hope to learn what circuit mechanisms are used in  this brain region, which may help identify how disruption of these mechanisms causes  brain and olfactory malfunction. Second, we hope to improve computer performance by using insights into how the brain computes.",CRCNS: Common algorithmic strategies used by the brain for labeling points in high-dimensional space,9692942,R01DC017695,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Burn injury', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Dreams', 'Drosophila genus', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fire - disasters', 'Fruit', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Olfaction Disorders', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'combinatorial', 'computer science', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learning community', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'red wine', 'response', 'theories']",NIDCD,SALK INSTITUTE FOR BIOLOGICAL STUDIES,R01,2018,481000,0.03945145278092779

"Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging Project Summary In this project we want to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric  metabolic maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution. The key to this new technology is the novel combination of three state-of-the-art imaging concepts: (A) new hardware that enables the simultaneous  measurement of multinuclear magnetic resonance (MR) signals at different frequencies; (B) the flexibility and robustness of Plug-and-Play (PnP) MR Fingerprinting (MRF); and (C) a data fusion process driven by a cross-modality model based on statistical learning. For brevity, we will call this fused simultaneous multinuclear PnP-MRF technique MNF (Multi-Nuclear Fusion). The idea behind MNF is to rapidly capture two different kinds of quantitative  information throughout the whole brain in one single scan: (1) structural information from proton (1H) MRF such as T1, T2, and proton density (PD) (tissue-scale morphology); and (2) metabolic information related to ion  homeostasis from sodium (23Na) MRF, such as intracellular sodium concentration, and intracellular, extracellular and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) volume fractions (cellular-scale function). Because PnP-MRF can quantify multiple  tissue properties free of experimental bias, it enables us to employ statistical learning to discover a subject-specific cross-modality model that integrates all voxelwise inter-relationships between the multi-parametric 1H PnP-MRF (acquired at high resolution, 0.75-1 mm) and 23Na PnP-MRF (acquired at low resolution, 3-5 mm) maps. These subject-specific relations can subsequently be used to sharpen the 23Na metabolic maps to match the resolution of the 1H structural maps. The high-resolution 23Na maps will enable the assessment of metabolic processes in vivo and bridge the gap in resolution that has held back our ability to study metabolism in the living human brain, which is crucial for our understanding of the brain itself and the afflictions that affect it. This proof-of-concept implementation will be developed at 7 T, but it is expected to be adaptable to clinical 3 T MR scanners. The specific aims are: (1) Data acquisition, (1.a) multi-channel 1H/23Na RF array, (1.b) simultaneous multinuclear 3D MRF sequence; (2) Data processing, (2.a) PnP-MRF reconstruction for both 1H data (fingerprint matching to generate structural maps) and 23Na data (tissue 4-compartment model and simulation of spin 3/2 dynamics to generate metabolic maps), (2.b) cross-modality model using statistical learning, and data fusion algorithm to generate high-resolution metabolic maps; (3) Method validation, (3.a) accuracy and precision, (3.b) repeatability and reproducibility.(3) Exploratory aim: Test MNF on patients with chronic steno-occlusive disease, with  recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA)/minor stroke, presenting regional brain ischemia, at 3 time points (baseline, 8-month and 16-month follow-ups), and comparison with healthy controls. Project Narrative We propose to develop a new non-invasive imaging technique that will provide multi-parametric metabolic 3D maps of the living brain at an unprecedented resolution, based on the fusion of simultaneously acquired proton and sodium data with plug-and-play magnetic resonance fingerprinting. The fusion algorithm between high- resolution proton structural maps and low-resolution sodium metabolic maps will be based on a cross-modality model optimized with statistical learning methods, and will generate for the first time high-resolution metabolic maps related to ion homeostasis in the brain in vivo. These new fused high-resolution structural and metabolic maps will provide new insights into neuro-architecture, neuro-biochemistry and their interconnection, which are crucial for our understanding of the human brain and its disorders.",Simultaneous Multinuclear Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting for Data Fusion of Quantitative Structural and Metabolic Imaging,9574362,R01EB026456,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anterior', 'Architecture', 'Back', 'Biochemistry', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Brain Ischemia', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Fluid', 'Fingerprint', 'Frequencies', 'Gender', 'Goals', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Intracellular Fluid', 'Ions', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'Patients', 'Perfusion', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Recurrence', 'Reproducibility', 'Resolution', 'Scanning', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sodium', 'Stroke', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transient Ischemic Attack', 'Validation', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized data processing', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'design', 'extracellular', 'flexibility', 'hemodynamics', 'in vivo', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'metabolic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'molecular imaging', 'new technology', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'prototype', 'radiofrequency', 'reconstruction', 'simulation']",NIBIB,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2018,685473,0.009191338462620878
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Non-invasive Neuromodulation Unit (NNU) Work was conducted under clinical protocols NCT03065335 and NCT03289923. Major accomplishments for the NNU were the recruitment of additional staff, acquiring research data from our first subjects in our collaboration with the Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch (ETPB), launching our initial multimodal protocol in combined TMS and talk therapy, installation and testing of neuromodulation equipment, expanding our training of staff to include additional labs at NIH as a core function, writing of software to implement experiments and collect and process data, protocol development and launch of the Multimodal Brain Stimulation speaker series. We now have a fully functional noninvasive neuromodulation laboratory operating for use with human subjects installed in the inpatient unit in the Clinical Center which is actively enrolling subjects in IRB approved trials.   Training in the safe and effective delivery of neuromodulation is one of our major functions as a Service within the Center for Multimodal Neuroimaging. We continue to provide in-service training on TMS safety, including hands-on training sessions covering the following procedures: Motor threshold determination, electromyography (EMG), Paired pulse TMS measures of cortical excitability, simultaneous TMS/EEG to measure TMS-evoked potentials, Somatosensory evoked potentials, Paired Associative Stimulation (a paradigm which induces neural plasticity), TMS-Safety procedures, and the role of Nursing in TMS and patient management.  Our projects fall into 3 themes: 1) measuring neuroplasticity, 2) modulating neuroplasticity, 3) modeling the effects of neuromodulation and mining multi-modal datasets to discover biomarkers of rapid antidepressant response. Our projects include:  Theme I: Measuring Neuroplasticity  Mechanisms of Rapid Antidepressant Action collaboration with Drs. Zarate and Park o This project develops biomarkers of rapid antidepressant response through the addition of TMS-EMG, TMS-EEG and TMS-fMRI neuroplasticity measures to the existing intramural research program on ketamine.   Concurrent fMRI-guided rTMS and cognitive therapy for the treatment of major depressive episodes o This project (which also incorporates Theme II, below) uses MEG (in collaboration with Allison Nugent (ETPB)), fMRI, and TMS/EEG to measure brain network engagement and neuroplastic changes due to multimodal TMS/CBT in depressed adults.  Theme II: Modulating Neuroplasticity  We are taking complementary approaches to modulating neuroplasticity: 1) seizure-induced neuroplasticity, 2) paired associative stimulation (PAS) and 3) novel tool development to extend the spatial and temporal specificity of noninvasive neuromodulation.   Next generation seizure therapy collaboration with Drs. Zarate, Park, Bikson, Datta o Therapeutically induced seizures exert rapid antidepressant action and are robust inducers of neurotrophic factors and neurogenesis. New technologies for focal seizure induction may improve the risk/benefit ratio by lowering cognitive side effects, and also provide the valuable scientific opportunity to examine common mechanisms across rapidly acting interventions such as ketamine.  o This project involves optimization of seizure therapy dosing, through the study of individualized low amplitude seizure therapy (iLAST), comprised of focal seizure induction with minimal current exposure to improve tolerability of seizure therapy for depression.   Cognitive Paired Associative Stimulation (C-PAS)  o PAS has been shown to strengthen synaptic efficacy within a circuit through repeated co-activation and coincident firing. We extend that approach to activate a targeted neural circuit through cognitive task performance, and couple that with simultaneous focal neuromodulation to enhance plasticity, as a means of enhancing circuit function and improving the functional-specificity of neuromodulation action. One of our projects employs fMRI-guided TMS paired with a specific form of cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of depression (in collaboration with Dr. Strauman). Another of our projects, being conducted in the form of a cooperative agreement (5U01AG050618) uses fMRI-guided TMS with simultaneous working memory training to enhance executive function in older adults (in collaboration with Drs. Appelbaum, Peterchev, and Cabeza).  Noninvasive focal deep brain stimulation (nfDBS) o Noninvasive brain stimulation is either focal and superficial, or deep and broad. Its utility as a clinical and research tool hinges on the ability to improve the spatial and temporal aspects of targeting. These projects address innovative approaches to improve the spatial resolution of TMS at depth, to precisely target deep brain structures and distributed networks of interest.   Transcranial direction current stimulation to reduce effects of nicotine withdrawal syndrome NIDA Protocol 12-DA-N474 (PI: E.A.Stein, collaborators: Betty Jo Salmeron, Sarah Aronson) Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal remain a major impediment for smokers trying to quit, with most quit attempts failing within the first week of abstinence when withdrawal symptoms are at their height. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has the potential to modify neuronal circuits by application of a subthreshold conductive current through the scalp. The goal is to investigate the effects of tDCS on modulating large-scale brain networks dysregulated in nicotine addiction and withdrawal.  Neural mechanisms underlying noninvasive brain stimulation assisted motor skill learning in older adults.  Closed-loop paired associative stimulation o The effects of noninvasive brain stimulation can be extremely variable across subjects.  One source of this variability is known to be the state of the brain at the time of stimulation.  One way of addressing this source of variability is to trigger the TMS when the brain is in an up-state or a down-state.  To accomplish this, real-time signal processing is utilized to analyze the EEG and predict where the brain oscillations will be milliseconds in advance.  The TMS trigger is controlled by the real-time hardware.   Theme III: Modeling Neuroplasticity / Mining Multi-Modal Datasets  Our team comprises engineering expertise to perform in silico modeling of the spatial and temporal effects of neuromodulation on neuronal function, and to apply machine learning and graph theoretical approaches to data-mining and hypothesis generation to support the discovery of common mechanisms across rapidly acting antidepressant interventions. n/a",Non-invasive Neuromodulation Unit (NNU),9790838,ZIAMH002955,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Equipment', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Focal Seizure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Height', 'Inpatients', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Ketamine', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neuronavigation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Nurse&apos', 's Role', 'Patients', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Safety', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Series', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Smoker', 'Somatosensory Evoked Potentials', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'Work', 'Writing', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive task', 'computerized data processing', 'data mining', 'design', 'disability burden', 'electric field', 'executive function', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'healthy volunteer', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'magnetic seizure therapy', 'millisecond', 'motor skill learning', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurogenesis', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotrophic factor', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'protocol development', 'recruit', 'response', 'risk benefit ratio', 'signal processing', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,ZIA,2018,2247734,-0.0222647178791122
"Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience. We will disseminate our algorithms and software to the research community via NITRC . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function and dysfunction.

"Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and difﬁculties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speciﬁc brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speciﬁc behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ﬁrst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ﬁnding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care. A primary goal of this project is to create open-source software that is used by the neuroscience community to advance research in understanding the brain basis of behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders. Project Narrative This grant is focused on developing novel analysis of complex brain networks from structural and functional imaging and using this to link brain features to behavioral phenotypes. These algorithms will be used to discover brain biomarkers of behavioral traits in Autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders.","Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes",9546678,R01EB022876,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Phenotype', 'Population Control', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain shape', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'individual variation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'social', 'trait']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2018,381250,0.04377801283430124
"Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning Abstract Classically, anatomic information provided by MRI has been essential to the neurosurgeon to maximize extent of tumor resection and, as a result, improve survival statistics. That said, it is not routine during resections to make use of similar imaging information that reflect the functional organization of the brain. Task-based fMRI has been employed as a means of pre-operatively localizing function. However, task-based fMRI depends on the patient’s ability to comply with the task paradigm, which frequently is lacking. This problem can be overcome by using the recently developed method of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to localize function. Moreover, rsfMRI is highly efficient, as multiple resting state networks (RSNs) associated with multiple cognitive domains can be mapped at the same time. With this in mind, the long-term goal of our research is to improve survival and quality of life after surgical resection of brain tumors by improving the identification/preservation of eloquent cortex. The current barrier that prevents the widespread use of rsfMRI is 1) the high degree of advanced imaging expertise currently necessary to create and interpret the images and 2) the necessary IT infrastructure necessary to support the analyses. To address this shortcoming, we propose to create a turnkey system for functional mapping within the brain that resides on a cloud-computing platform. At the heart of our methodology is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm that assigns RSN membership to each locus within the brain using supervised classification of rsfMRI data. Current data demonstrate that MLP-based RSN mapping is more reliable than conventional task-based fMRI and is extremely sensitive to sites identified by cortical stimulation (the standard in intraoperative mapping). Translation of the science and techniques created at Washington University will be accomplished by a deep collaboration with Radiologics, an emerging company with strong expertise in cloud computing for clinical imaging. Towards this end, the overall objective of the proposed project is to create an imaging technology package, named Cirrus, that will integrate automatic MLP-based RSN mapping with cloud-based computing. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to 1) Create Cloud-Based rsfMRI Brain Mapping Capability - Cirrus, 2) Deploy Cloud-Based rsfMRI Capability (Cirrus Platform) to New User Host Institutions, and 3) Optimize the Clinical User Interface (UI) of Cirrus. The expected outcome of this translational strategy will be an integrated imaging/surgical presurgical mapping technology using rsfMRI with clearly defined performance capabilities, well delineated localization outputs, and a clinician friendly user experience that scales to all types of health care settings. Thus, this proposal is innovative because there currently does not exist any comparable system that integrates cutting edge image analysis tools with cloud-based capabilities. This work is significant because it will disseminate technology that fundamentally enhances the surgeon’s understanding of the functional implications of their surgical strategy, thereby enables safer, more tailored approaches to improving outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research is an academic industry partnership that will make available, to any neurosurgical practice advanced functional MRI methodology to define critical regions in the brain. This development is relevant to public health because it has the potential to improve functional outcomes following surgical removal of brain tumors. Towards this end, we propose to create an imaging technology package that will integrate 1) advanced machine learning techniques using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and 2) cloud-based computing, to perform advanced brain mapping. Thus, advanced functional localization can be standardized and acquired at any institution by being uniformly processed in the cloud and sent back to the home institution without the need for costly infrastructure. The integrated package will enable clinicians in any practice environment to efficiently and reliably visualize function on the brain’s anatomy prior to surgery.",Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning,9552903,R44GM125438,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Glioma', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Rest', 'Science', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stress Tests', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tumor resection', 'clinical imaging', 'cloud based', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'health care settings', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'statistics', 'tool', 'translational approach', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,"RADIOLOGICS, INC.",R44,2018,740001,0.020948419294133564
"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn. The goal of this research is to create mathematical models that can predict measureable health consequences from manganese exposure using medical imaging and individual exposure data.",Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity,9494372,F31ES028081,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Exposure to', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intoxication', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Manganese', 'Maps', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Medical Imaging', 'Metals', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Neurotoxins', 'Normalcy', 'Occupational', 'Outcome', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Poison', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Questionnaires', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Running', 'Safety', 'Source', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Structure of nail of toe', 'Symptoms', 'Test Result', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Toxic effect', 'Translating', 'Welding', 'Work', 'Workplace', 'air sampling', 'base', 'cohort', 'exposed human population', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'innovation', 'mathematical model', 'motor impairment', 'multimodality', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'non-invasive imaging', 'outcome prediction', 'pharmacokinetic model', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'screening', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool', 'translational impact']",NIEHS,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,F31,2018,44524,0.024203811232943986
"Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This lack of progress is reflected in the continued excessive direct and indirect health care expenditure related to these conditions, largely in form of unnecessary diagnostic procedures to rule out ""organic"" disease and lack of novel, cost effective therapies. During the past funding cycle, we have identified functional alterations of brain networks in IBS patients, both in the resting state and in response to physical and psychological stimuli, which are related to sex, gene polymorphisms and a history of early adverse life events. These functional findings were accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of both white and grey matter in the brain of IBS patients resulting in a distinct ""brai signature"". In this revised competitive renewal application, I plan to take these insights to the next level by validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IB patients from healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome. Using an array of advanced, innovative brain imaging, genomic and microbiological techniques, I will address these goals in 3 Specific Aims: A. Identify disease- specific brain signatures of IBS, identify correlations of these signatures with behavioral and clinical parameters, and determine accuracy to predict IBS phenotype compared to HCs, and patients with chronic gut inflammation (ulcerative colitis). B. Identify gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and correlate with distinct brain signatures in IBS patients as identified in Aim A. C. Identify gut microbiome derived metabolites which correlate with brain signatures in IBS patients. The longitudinal design of the study combined with a mediator/moderator analysis approach will enable us to infer causality between brain, peripheral factors and symptoms, and will provide the basis for future mechanistic studies in animal models. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to improve our understanding of the complex bidirectional brain gut interactions of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS and identify biomarkers in order to develop more effective treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 15% of the U.S. population and leads to a substantial economic and societal burden. Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for IBS. This proposal is relevant to public health in that it is aimed at validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IBS patients fro healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome to provide the basis for mechanistic studies, advance our knowledge of IBS pathophysiology and aid future development of IBS therapies.",Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation,9529636,R01DK048351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feces', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Metadata', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visceral', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disorder control', 'early life stress', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiome composition', 'microbiota', 'monocyte', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'pain sensitivity', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,576642,0.08620936994168082
"Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. With respect to the mission of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, more complete resection reduces the burden of neurological disease by restoring function, extending life, and improving the quality of that life. With respect to surgical therapy, the deployment of visual displays that relate the patient's exposed brain within the operating room (OR) to the pre- operatively acquired neuroanatomical images has become commonplace. More specifically, surgeons can use a pen-like stylus to point at a specific feature on the patient's brain tissue and see where that tissue resides on the neuroanatomical images as facilitated by an interactive display. One detriment to this process is when the patient's brain deforms due to common surgical manipulations. As a result, the alignment between images and the patient's physical brain becomes compromised and surgical error could ensue. Over years 1-7 of this award (initial submission & first renewal), we have demonstrated that intraoperatively acquired cortical surface geometric data can be used to: improve image-to-patient alignment, measure brain deformations during surgery, and drive a computational approach to brain shift correction during image-guided neurosurgery. In this application, we take the final step of extensive intraoperative validation and independent testing. The hypothesis to be tested is that computer models, cortical surface geometric data, and tracked stylus digitization technology when used to compensate for deformation during image-guided brain tumor surgery can predict the locations of eloquent brain surround pathology such that this approach is an effective surrogate to intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. The specific aims to accomplish this are to: (1) integrate a novel computer-vision based approach to surgical field digitization within the surgical microscope and commercial guidance environment such that acquired data can drive a computer model-based approach to correct displays for deformations, (2) conduct a 20 patient retrospective validation study with independent collaborator Dr. Alex Golby of Brigham and Women's hospital comparing the results from our cortical surface deformation driven compensation pipeline to that acquired by the ""gold standard"" iMR imaging approach, (3) conduct two prospective 20 patient studies at Vanderbilt and the Brigham respectively, and evaluate intraoperative workflow, as well as the efficacy of corrected displays at institutions wit and without the presence of the iMR alternative. With respect to the importance of this work, in large part, the use of image-guided surgery for surgical resection in soft-tissue organs has been confined primarily to the cranial environment with the common understanding that 'brain shift' is a problem. With the resolution of deformations by this low-cost minimally encumbered solution, the ability to translate image-guided surgery to other soft- tissue organs could become commonplace. Furthermore, the approaches herein are inexpensive when compared to intra-operative imaging methods (e.g. MR), and scalable, i.e. capable of widespread adoption. This application could be seminal in providing the needed surrogate for the wider populations of patient that could benefit from improved 'deformation corrected' guidance but may not have access to iMR facilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. The above translates to an estimated 23,170 new cases diagnosed this year with approximately 14,080 deaths. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. More complete resection restores function, extends life, and improves the quality of that life. The goal of this project is to assist the surgeon in producing a more complete resection of brain tumors. The other important aspect is the technology we are introducing is relatively inexpensive and is amenable to widespread adoption by medical centers all across the country.",Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface,9476359,R01NS049251,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lasers', 'Life', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Mission', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Suggestion', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Error', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Wit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor resection', 'childhood cancer mortality', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'functional restoration', 'human old age (65+)', 'image guided', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'male', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'soft tissue', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NINDS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,733330,0.010583675245658022
"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9456759,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'adult obesity', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'collaborative environment', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'immunoregulation', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2018,202835,0.041346660786845284
"Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Abstract: The increasing availability of infant brain MR images, such as those that will be collected through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP, on which Dr. Shen is a Co-PI, focusing on data acquisition), affords unprecedented opportunities for precise charting of dynamic early brain developmental trajectories in understanding normative and aberrant growth. However, to fully benefit from these datasets, a major barrier that needs to be overcome is the critical lacking of computational tools for accurate processing and analysis of infant MRI data, which typically exhibit poor tissue contrast, large within tissue intensity variation, and regionally-heterogeneous and dynamic changes. To fill this critical gap, in 2012 we pioneered in creating an infant-centric MRI processing software package, called infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Tool (iBEAT), and a set of infant-specific atlases, called UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases, and further made them freely and publicly available via NITRC. Over the last 4 years, iBEAT and UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases have been downloaded 2900+ and 5600+ times, respectively, and contributed to 160+ independent research papers. As indicated by 30+ support letters, iBEAT is now driving the research for MRI studies of early brain development in many labs throughout the world. Results produced by iBEAT are also highlighted in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT, by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. To achieve this goal, we propose four aims. In Aim 1, we will create an innovative learning-based multi-source information integration framework for joint skull stripping and tissue segmentation for accurate structural measurements. Our method employs random forest to adaptively learn the optimal image appearance features from multimodality images and also informative context features from tissue probability maps. In Aim 2, we will construct longitudinal infant brain atlases at multiple time points (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age) for both T1-/T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR images. We propose a longitudinally-consistent sparse representation technique to construct representative atlases with significantly improved structural details by explicitly dealing with possible misalignments between images even after registration. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel learning-based approach for cortical topology correction and integrate it, along with our infant-centric analysis tools and atlases for cortical surfaces, into iBEAT for precise mapping of dynamic and complex cortical changes in infants. Unlike existing tools that perform poorly for infant brains, we will incorporate infant-dedicated tools for topology correction, surface reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and measurements. We will further integrate longitudinal infant cortical surface atlases equipped with parcellations based on growth trajectories. In Aim 4, we will significantly enhance iBEAT in terms of its software functionalities as well as user support via systematic outreach and training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC. Project Narrative This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. In particular, we propose four aims: 1) Learning-Based Brain Segmentation; 2) Infant Brain Atlases in the First Year of Life; 3) Cortical Surface-Based Analysis; and 4) Enhancing User Experience and Training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC.",Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools,9613643,R01MH117943,"['2 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Appearance', 'Atlases', 'Automobile Driving', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Documentation', 'Education and Outreach', 'Environment', 'Exhibits', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Life', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Online Systems', 'Paper', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Speed', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Variant', 'adaptive learning', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'cranium', 'critical period', 'data acquisition', 'diffusion weighted', 'experience', 'file format', 'forest', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interoperability', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'reconstruction', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,466500,0.027601989576603512
"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions. The starting point of the project is our earlier discovery that phase structure in oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) of hippocampal areas CA1/CA3 carry location information in exquisite detail (Agarwal et al. 2014). We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations. The computational description level will leverage ideas of vector symbolic architectures, a class of connectionist models originally proposed for describing cognitive reasoning (Plate, 1995; Kanerva, 1996). Models produced by the software tool will concisely encapsulate assumptions about the computation and its implementation of a brain function and produce predictions that can be tested in a next generation of recording experiments. The proposed theory framework will be tested in building models for navigation in hippocampus and for visual processing in areas V1 and V4 in cortex.

"Towards integrated 3D reconstruction of whole human brains at subcellular resolution Project Summary A detailed understanding of the anatomical and molecular architectures of brain cells and their brain-wide organization is essential for interrogating human brain function and dysfunction. Extensive efforts have been made toward mapping brain cells through various lenses, which have established invaluable databases yielding new insights. However, integrative extraction of the multimodal properties of various cell-types brain-wide within the same brain, crucial to elucidating complex intercellular relationships, remains nearly impossible. We have developed high-throughput, cost-effective technology platforms to create a fully integrated three-dimensional (3D) human brain cell atlas by simultaneously mapping high-dimensional features (e.g., spatial, molecular, morphological, and microenvironment information) of all cells acquired from the same whole brain. The proposed work will establish the most comprehensive 3D human brain map to date, with unprecedented resolution and completeness. We envision that this atlas will facilitate the integration of a broad range of studies and allow the research community to interrogate human brain structure and function at multiple levels. In Aim 1, we will apply a novel technology to transform whole human brain tissue into indestructible hydrogel–tissue hybrids that allow highly multiplexed molecular labeling and subcellular-resolution volume imaging. In Aim 2, we will apply scalable labeling and imaging technologies to map the brain-wide 3D distribution of various cell-type and structural markers at subcellular resolution within the same brain. Our chemical engineering–based approach to this aim will enable cost-effective, lossless 3D labeling of the entire human brain at lower cost as traditional subsampling approaches. True volume labeling and subcellular-resolution imaging will allow us to extract fine morphological and connectivity information from labeled cells and reconstruct the microenvironment of all cells. In Aim 3, we will use a host of rapid and highly automated algorithms to perform unbiased, integrative high- dimensional phenotyping of all cells based on their spatial location, molecular expression, morphology, and microenvironment. In Aim 4, we will perform super-resolution phenotyping of cells in a selected brain region from the same sample used in Aim 3 to map inter-areal axonal connectivity at single-fiber resolution and to characterize chemical synapses. This integrative approach will likely unveil unique cell-types and brain regions, a crucial step toward a better understanding of brain function. The complete 3D dataset will be linked to magnetic resonance and diffusion spectrum images and existing reference atlases to facilitate the integration of a wide breadth of study at multiple levels and to make the data publicly accessible for mining and analysis. A detailed picture of the human brain’s complex intermolecular, intercellular, and interareal interactions is of paramount importance for understanding its function and dysfunction. However, the immense complexity of the human brain and the absence of enabling technologies have hither-to made it impossible to interrogate these interactions brain-wide.

"Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome No abstract available Project Narrative Targeted, informed therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how complex patterns of brain activity arise from stationary white matter architecture.

Our study will leverage the presence of a consistent genetic lesion in this patient cohort to generate findings that could lay the groundwork for the development of interventions to restore healthy brain dynamics in individuals with psychosis-spectrum symptoms.",Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,9682666,F30MH118871,"['22q11.2', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Occupational', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Direction', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'University Hospitals', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'conotruncal anomaly face syndrome', 'early onset', 'insight', 'learning network', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'psychotic symptoms', 'regional difference', 'selective attention', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2018,49524,0.04342329179351772
"Enabling Shared Analysis and Processing of Large Neurophysiology Data Project Summary / Abstract Understanding brain function is key to improving health care and advancing a number of scientific initiatives. The treatment of degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and ALS is becoming increasingly important as the current US population ages and life expectancies increase. The costs of Alzheimer's and other dementias is estimated at over $200 billion in 2016 alone, not to mention the human devastation that these diseases incur. Autism, addiction, depression, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and pain treatment are just a few more of the critically important health concerns related to brain function. Cognitive science is also at the forefront of research into computational and autonomous systems, with the potential to revolutionize human computer interaction and tackle emerging global challenges. As a result of these and other significant opportunities the BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Presidential initiative was created to improve the future health and competitiveness of the nation, with the fundamental goal of accelerating brain research. Consistent with this goal, the brain research community has developed the Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB) file format and specification to support large-scale collaboration and research. This open format was created in 2014 and is already making an impact on cellular-based neurophysiology, with organizations such as the Allen Institute for Brain Science generating and sharing datasets such as the Allen Brain Observatory and the Allen Cell Types Database. Although this preliminary work is promising, progress in the research community is slowed by a lack of software tools to readily browse, process, analyse, and visualize NWB data, while promoting replicability. Thus this work aims to to produce such tools in support of the BRAIN initiative and other large-scale brain research programs by supporting and growing the NWB community. The work proposed here addresses three important workflows in cellular-based neurophysiology: o​ ptical physiology to image neurons under stimuli, silicon probe recordings to detect spike events from the surface of the cortex down through deeps​ structures, and​ in vitro slice electrophysiology to record t​ ime-varying stimulus and electrical response from a neuron​. Novel multiscale software tools will be created to enable efficient browsing, processing, analysis, and visualization of NWB-based brain data; linking experimental stimuli to observed responses. Conversion utilities will also be developed to convert existing data into NWB form. As the data is large, complex, and may be distributed across many sites, the software tools will be web-based, enabling researchers to remotely access and process data in a reproducible manner, and to use scalable cloud computing resources. The software will be released under open source licences and will be placed under formal software process to facilitate sharing across the research community. The tools will be conceived and created with the help of Allen scientists, who will also perform final validation using these three workflows. Project Narrative This research is aimed at better understanding brain function. Such knowledge may lead to improved therapies for degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and ALS; and provide new treatments for autism, addiction, depression, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and pain treatment. These studies of brain science may also yield significant insights into computing areas such as robotics and computer vision, thereby providing both healthcare and economic benefits.",Enabling Shared Analysis and Processing of Large Neurophysiology Data,9515062,R44MH115731,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Case Study', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Mental Depression', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Pain management', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Silicon', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'community based participatory research', 'computer human interaction', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data format', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'data warehouse', 'design', 'distributed data', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'file format', 'hackathon', 'health care economics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'web interface', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R44,2018,728425,0.06154550781333562
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9307803,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reproducibility', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'signal processing', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2017,549838,0.07267662658767331
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9272937,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2017,186993,0.04543564662506513
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9213309,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical predictors', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'serial imaging', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,451650,0.009653076277742822
"Deep Learning for Connectomics Project Summary/Abstract The brain contains a vast number of neurons that are connected with each other through synapses, thereby forming a complex anatomical network that mediates information ﬂow within the brain. The brain “wiring diagram” will be a foundational tool for elucidating the function and dysfunction of brains. Electron microscopy (EM) is widely considered to be the gold standard for neuronal level circuit recon- struction. Currently, a major and serious bottleneck in this ﬁeld is image segmentation and reconstruc- tion. It is estimated that the data analysis accuracy and throughput are lagging behind data acquisition by orders of magnitude. This project aims at dramatically improving the accuracy and throughput of brain EM image analysis, thereby enabling accurate and efﬁcient reconstruction of neuronal level brain maps. Speciﬁcally, this project is built up on the recent success in deep learning methods, which are dominant tools for EM image analysis. A central and unresolved challenge of using deep learning for segmentation is how to achieve the conﬂicting goals of integrating sufﬁcient contextual features while preserving full-resolution information. This project will develop a novel residual encoder-decoder model to achieve these two goals simultaneously (Aim 1). In current deep learning segmentation methods, the labels of each pixel are predicted independently. To fully consider the brain topological structure and couple the predictions of spatially adjacent pixels, this project will develop a hybrid recurrent and convo- lutional network model (Aim 2). In this model, the recurrent network is integrated with the convolutional network to incorporate the multi-dimensional structural information. When combined with Aim 1, these methods are expected to dramatically improve the accuracy of EM image segmentation. In most cur- rent deep learning segmentation methods, the training and/or prediction stages require the extraction of patches centered on each pixel. This step forms a bottleneck that limits the overall throughput. This project will develop novel techniques to achieve whole-image training and prediction (Aim 3). These approaches will enable very efﬁcient training and segmentation, thereby dramatically increasing the throughput of EM image analysis. Project narrative Wiring diagrams of the brain circuits serve as a foundational tool for studying brain function and dys- function. This project aims at developing advanced computational methods for boosting the accuracy and throughput of brain circuit reconstruction from electron microscopy images.

"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders.

"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research.

Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9419223,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'prevent', 'programs', 'screening', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,247092,0.026134895889723193
"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9240674,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography', 'source localization']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2017,531286,0.032492737007987896
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9405530,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2017,680002,0.059799634978958204
"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Integrating human connectomics and brain imaging genomics offers enormous potential, allowing us to perform systems biology approaches of the brain to better understand the interplay between genes, brain connectivity, and phenotypic outcomes (e.g., cognition, behavior, disorder). This proposal seeks to develop novel bioinformatics methods and software tools for integrative study of human connectomics and brain imaging genomics. These methods and tools can be applied to: (1) study normal brain functions to impact biomedical research in general, and (2) study brain disorders to improve public health outcomes by facilitating diagnostic and therapeutic progress.",Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics,9324260,R01EB022574,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Beds', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Cognition', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Evaluation', 'Fiber', 'Functional disorder', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Graph', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Knowledge Discovery', 'Learning', 'Learning Module', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Systems Biology', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visual', 'base', 'connectome', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'density', 'functional outcomes', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning outcome', 'learning strategy', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'phenotypic data', 'public health relevance', 'software systems', 'tool', 'tractography', 'trait', 'white matter', 'whole genome']",NIBIB,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2017,101908,0.033782458961269905
"Heterogeneity of Multi-modal Imaging Signatures of Aging, MCI, Alzheimer's disease via Pattern Analysis Abstract Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as well as its prodromal stages, poses a significant burden to the community and health care system. Several other pathologic processes often co-exist with AD pathology. Characterizing the multi-faceted aspects of brain changes present in aging and (prodromal) AD not only provides insights into the underlying pathophysiological processes, such as amyloid deposition, small vessel ischemic disease(SVID), and neurodegeneration or functional change, but also leads to biomarkers of these pathologic processes. In this proposal, we aim to capture the heterogeneity of various imaging patterns that reflect pathologic processes occurring with aging and prodromal AD, by applying state of the art heterogeneity analysis machine learning methods recently developed in our laboratory to multi-faceted imaging data (structural MRI, resting state functional MRI, amyloid imaging). These methods allow us to quantify the different ways/patterns in which an individual can fall off the normative brain aging trajectories. Our goal is to arrive at a new “Imaging-based coordinate SysTem for AGing and NeurodeGenerative diseases”(iSTAGING), each dimension of which will reflect a different pattern of brain alterations, hence capturing the underlying neuroanatomical, neurofunctional and neuropathological heterogeneity in quantifiable and replicable metrics. Moreover, we aim to link these neuroimaging phenotypes with neurocognitive phenotypes, as well as with progression from cognitively normal aging to MCI and to dementia. This will allow us to place each individual into a new dimensional brain coordinate system of aging and map his/her trajectory, as well to determine predictive indices emanating from multi-parametric imaging data. Prior to achieving these aims, we will strengthen and apply various imaging harmonization methods, which are critical in ensuring that data across studies and scanners can be integrated in a constructive way. In particular, Aim1 will apply inter-site imaging harmonization methods, and hence develop a platform that will allow us to integrate multi-parametric imaging datasets from more than 10,000 participants to several studies spanning ages 45 to 89; we will therefore form a large multi-modal imaging database capturing the heterogeneity of normal brain aging and prodromal AD. Aim 2 will use machine learning methods to integrate spatial patterns of brain atrophy, SVID, Aβ deposition and functional connectivity in this population, and will derive normative brain aging curves. Aim 3 will use state of the art semi-supervised learning methods to disentangle the heterogeneity of imaging patterns distinguishing resilient from advanced brain aging: this will lead to the dimensional system (iSTAGING) capturing the diverse dimensions/patterns of advanced (non-resilient) age-related brain change relative to resilient brain aging, which reflect underlying neuropathological processes. Aim 4 will relate iSTAGING coordinates and longitudinal trajectories to cognition, risk factors, and clinical progression from normal cognition to MCI to dementia, in order to further elucidate the clinical correlates of these neuroimaging dimensions. Project narrative This proposal pools imaging data from 11 different studies, with a total of more than 10,000 individuals of ages 45 to 95, aiming to obtain a comprehensive characterization of brain aging. State of the art imaging harmonization, pattern analysis and machine learning methods will be used to derive normative brain aging curves, and to characterize the heterogeneity of deviations from these curves in people with resilient and accelerated brain aging. Moreover, we aim to relate these imaging patterns to cognitive performance. We will eventually derive and “Imaging-based coordinate SysTem for AGing and NeurodeGenerative diseases”(iSTAGING), allowing us to place any individual's scans into a quantitative measurement system and plot his/her trajectories over time.","Heterogeneity of Multi-modal Imaging Signatures of Aging, MCI, Alzheimer's disease via Pattern Analysis",9211062,RF1AG054409,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer disease detection', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Anatomy', 'Atrophic', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Ensure', 'Family', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Laboratories', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Rest', 'Risk Factors', 'Scanning', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'United States', 'abeta deposition', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'amyloid imaging', 'base', 'care systems', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive performance', 'community burden', 'effective therapy', 'falls', 'frontier', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'insight', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'normal aging', 'pathological aging', 'predictive marker', 'quantitative imaging', 'resilience', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,RF1,2017,3791182,-0.036716917178614236
"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and machine learning algorithms in the future.   Project Narrative The Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive) is a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects.",A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive,9413774,R24MH114788,"['Algorithms', 'Archives', 'Atlases', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioconductor', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Ecosystem', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Familiarity', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Imagery', 'Individual', 'Ingestion', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Metadata', 'Modification', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Personnel Staffing', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'cloud storage', 'complex R', 'computerized data processing', 'data archive', 'data integration', 'data management', 'data modeling', 'data resource', 'data visualization', 'database structure', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'member', 'neural circuit', 'next generation', 'online resource', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'repository', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'web site', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2017,1247018,0.07177029364020453
"Functional Dissection of Prenatal Drug Effects on the Developing Brain and Behavior PROJECT SUMMARY Despite efforts of prevention and education programs, licit and illicit drug use among pregnant women remains prevalent1. Most drugs of abuse easily cross the placenta and can alter the intricate balance among fetal neurotransmitters and receptors, which critically dictate in utero development of the brain's functional wiring system2-5. Therefore prenatal drug exposures (PDE) have long-lasting implications for brain and behavioral development since a small perturbation to the immature brain circuits may cascade into substantial deviations during long-term growth6. Existing behavioral studies provide converging evidence on the detrimental effects of PDE throughout development 1,6,7 but mechanistic studies of the brain basis of PDE remains scarce, especially during the infancy period. Nevertheless, studying the brain mechanisms of PDE during infancy is critical and urgently needed given that: 1) the infancy period immediately follows PDE insults and features the most dynamic postnatal brain development; 2) the infancy period is least confounded by postnatal environmental adversities that frequently accompany PDE; 3) identification of brain alterations associated with PDE during this stage has the best potential to guide early preventive intervention before behavioral problems onset. Our previous results8,9 demonstrated significant and widespread functional connectivity alterations in neonates prenatally exposed to cocaine and marijuana, respectively. However, three major areas need to be better delineated: 1) an overall picture of PDE effects on whole brain functional organization is lacking; 2) a more systematic delineation of the potential differential drug effects and their interactions is needed given the multi- drug exposure for most of the drug-abusing mothers; 3) the prediction power of detected neonatal functional alterations for later behavioral outcomes remains to be determined. Our long-term goal is to derive early functional-connectivity-based brain biomarkers for different PDEs that will reliably predict long-term behavioral outcomes. Our goal in this project is to derive neonate-based functional connectivity signatures for different PDEs and test their prediction power for 3-month behavioral outcomes. This project is significant because it is expected to be the first to identify drug-specific neurophenotypes for different PDEs on early brain functional and behavioral development, prior to the damaging postnatal influences that may accompany parental drug abuse. It is innovative because: 1) It will integrate resting-state brain functional connectivity and cognitive and behavioral function to quantify the potential drug-specific and drug-common effects on brain and behavior development in neonates; 2) It will apply detailed multi-level whole brain survey to discern differential drug-effect profiles and leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to better characterize their link with later behavioral outcomes. It is relevant to public health because it will provide currently unavailable knowledge of PDE effects on developing brain functional networks in neonates and inform earlier interventions that are documented to be most effective before symptom onset. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our long-term goal is to derive early functional-connectivity-based brain biomarkers for different PDEs that will reliably predict long-term behavioral outcomes.

How the brain com- pensates for damage in resilient patients remains a mystery, making it difficult to develop accurate prognoses and treatments that can leverage this process in less fortunate patients. Without this knowledge it will not be possible to create individualized therapies based on the brain's natural resiliency mechanism or to establish reliable ways to predict potential for recovery. The thriving field of brain connectivity network analysis, or con- nectomics, provides a promising tool with which to capture, model and understand mechanisms of resiliency. The long-term goal is to develop novel, personalized rehabilitation methods that mimic and enhance the brain's resiliency process to restore cognitive and physical abilities after damage due to neurological conditions. The overall objective of this work is to identify connectome-based imaging biomarkers of resiliency in MS, i.e. those that separate patients with high disease burden and low disability (high-adapters) from those with similar dis- ease burden and high disability (low-adapters). Our central hypothesis, the functional rerouting hypothesis, states that resilient patients' brains recover from injury by restoring normal functional connections using alter- nate white matter pathways to circumvent irrevocably damaged structural connections. This hypothesis is based on published and preliminary work in simulated studies, severe brain injury and mild to moderate trau- matic brain injury. The rationale for the proposed research is that insight into the brain's ability to compensate for injury would allow for more accurate prognostication and enable the development of novel therapeutic strategies for MS. Guided by strong preliminary data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: to identify global and regional metrics of the 1) structural and functional connectomes and 2) structure- function relationship between the connectomes that differentiate high-adapting and low-adapting MS patients. We will collect functional, diffusion and anatomical MRIs from 25 controls and 42 high- and 42 low-adapting MS patients to extract structural and functional connectomes and test central hypotheses. The approach is in- novative, in the applicant's opinion, as it implements cutting-edge machine learning techniques and a novel mathematical model to formalize the relationship between structural and functional connectomes and capture network-level functional rerouting in resiliency to MS-related damage. The proposed research is significant in that it is expected to have broad translational impact on the development of more accurate prognoses as well as targeted, personalized treatments for patients with MS and other neurological disorders. Ultimately, such knowledge has the potential to open up new horizons for innovative therapies, e.g. through non-invasive brain stimulation, that can dramatically improve the quality of life for patients with debilitating neurological disease. The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding the mechanisms underlying resiliency to multiple sclerosis related damage is ultimately expected to lead to the development of sensitive prognostic measures and individualized therapeutic interventions. Thus, the proposed work is relevant to the NINDS' mission in that it seeks fundamental knowledge about the brain in order to reduce the burden of neurological disease.",Quantifying the role of the connectome in resiliency to multiple sclerosis,9435991,R21NS104634,"['Anatomy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Injury', 'Innovative Therapy', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologic', 'Outcome', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physically Handicapped', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Recovery', 'Rehabilitation therapy', 'Research', 'Role', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive disability', 'connectome', 'disability', 'driving force', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'insight', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'multiple sclerosis treatment', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'outcome forecast', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'repaired', 'resilience', 'response', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'white matter', 'white matter damage']",NINDS,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R21,2017,254250,0.015724315710398565
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9316197,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Comorbidity', 'Compulsive Behavior', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'response', 'reward processing', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,749730,0.05765656405107311
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9384304,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opiates', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,704051,0.04778965318194216
"White Matter Connectivity and Network Analysis In a project with investigators from the Nervous System Development and Plasticity Section, NICHD, and the Program on Pediatric Imaging and Tissue Sciences (PPITS), NICHD we study the dynamic regulation of myelin by the surrounding glial cells and show that it is dependent on the level of activity present in an axon. We elucidated the biological mechanisms by which astrocytes regulate this process. Our role is to use a theoretical framework to predict how the changes in myelin thickness, as well as the increase in the nodal width, affects the propagation of the signals along a myelinated axon, and to experimentally measure conduction speeds using a data analysis framework we implemented. The theoretical and experimental results were in a very good agreement. A manuscript describing these methods and ultimately the mechanism of the dynamic myelin regulation is to be submitted to eLife in July of 2017.   We also developed different models of myelin plasticity, or generally, delay plasticity. We study the consequences of such adaptive time delays for two main cases: one where the plasticity is activity dependent and another where the plasticity depends on the temporal mismatch between presynaptic and postsynaptic action potentials. In the former case, we studied the effect of activity dependent adaptive time delays on the stability of the system of coupled oscillators, with its implications on the stability of the oscillations and synchrony in the brain. Two newly proposed models of delay plasticity are based on 1) temporal mismatch, akin to the spike time dependent plasticity, and 2) oligodendrocyte mediated learning. Both models were studied in the context of spiking neural networks. We show how the stability of the synchronized state in the network relies on having such adaptive delay. A manuscript describing this work is in the final stages of preparation.  In a project with investigators of the Section on Behavioral Neurogenetics in the Intramural Research Program at NICHD, we study patterns of gene expression in developing zebrafish using supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods and develop a framework for automated annotation of the zebrafish brain neuroanatomy. This work will allow the production of maps with increasingly fine-grained segmentation of distinct neuronal cell types and was presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Neuroscience in San Diego, CA, in November of 2016.  In collaboration with Dr. Basser (NICHD) and Dario Gasbarra, Ph.D. (University of Helsinki, Finland), we derived the probability distributions of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the case of symmetric random matrices, with isotropic matrix-variate Gaussian noise. We apply these results to diffusion tensor imaging and show how one can use Fisher information and spherical t-design to develop DTI experiments with isotropic statistical properties.  A manuscript describing this work has been published in SIAM Journal on Medical Imaging in July of 2017.  Together with four other principal investigators from NIH (NICHD, NINDS, and NIMH), we participated in a recently obtained R24 BRAIN Initiative grant (""In Vivo Brain Network Latency Mapping""). The goal of this effort is to measure the typical temporal latency information (the time delay that exists in the signaling communications between different brain regions) in a human brain, as being able to measure the latency information in vivo can provide a great diagnostic tool for a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. To achieve this, data from four different imaging modalities are utilized. These are: diffusion MRI, which provides the structural, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). In the initial stage we developed the algorithms for extracting latency information from the time series data.

"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience. We will disseminate our algorithms and software to the research community via NITRC .

"Multimodal Neuroimaging Approaches to Modeling Manganese Toxicity Project Summary/Abstract Manganese (Mn) is a known neurotoxin that tens of thousands of workers are exposed to daily, but it is unknown if the current safety guidelines are appropriately strong or too weak to protect them. In an ideal world knowledge of the exposure history of an individual should allow to predict specific risks for health effects. To monitor the effect of Mn welding fumes on workers, the medical imaging techniques Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Spectroscopy (MRS) are used to non-invasively image the structure, function, and neurochemistry in the human brain. However, currently studies are not making adequate strides in connecting Mn exposure to changes in MRI or MRS. Studies are only correlating Mn exposure to imaging parameters without taking into account the pharmacokinetic properties of the metal or the individual exposure history, thus lacking the ability to interpret individual data. The broad objective of this project is to fill this crucial gap by creating and validating mathematical models that take into account imaging data, pharmacokinetic properties of Mn and the individual exposure to Mn to predict individual effects of toxicity. Our group runs an ongoing, longitudinal neuroimaging study on local welders and matched controls. Thus we will have abundant and longitudinal data on brain MRI (e.g. T1 maps to assess the brain Mn burden), MRS data on several neurochemicals including GABA, data from personal air sampling and work history questionnaires, neurological and neuropsychological test results, and other biomarkers (toe nails, blood) at our disposal for modeling. The purpose of the current project is to assess and describe how knowledge on exposure and pharmacokinetic properties of Mn enables the interpretation of imaging data as quantitative brain Mn deposition, and how brain-region specific Mn deposition affects neurochemistry in other regions of the brain from where it is deposited. Aim 1 seeks to use MRI structural imaging and known pharmacokinetic properties of Mn to create a mathematical model that can determine the amount of Mn deposition in specific regions of the brain. Aim 2 investigates how the amount, the duration, and the location of Mn deposition in the brain affects neurochemistry. The results of this study will be a first step towards monitoring of individual risks from Mn toxicity by providing the necessary tools to translate exposure information to changes in the brain and consequent health symptoms. Importantly, a better interpretation of individual imaging data will also inform safety guidelines for the individual worker. Project Narrative Manganese (Mn) toxicity leads to disruptive symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease but has no known treatment or cure. Therefore, the prevention, rather than the treatment, of these toxic effects is the first priority for welders, smelters, and other workers exposed to Mn.

"Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and difﬁculties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speciﬁc brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speciﬁc behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ﬁrst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ﬁnding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care. A primary goal of this project is to create open-source software that is used by the neuroscience community to advance research in understanding the brain basis of behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders. Project Narrative This grant is focused on developing novel analysis of complex brain networks from structural and functional imaging and using this to link brain features to behavioral phenotypes. These algorithms will be used to discover brain biomarkers of behavioral traits in Autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders.","Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes",9360120,R01EB022876,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Phenotype', 'Population Control', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain shape', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'longitudinal dataset', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'social', 'trait']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2017,378750,0.04377801283430124
"Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning Abstract Classically, anatomic information provided by MRI has been essential to the neurosurgeon to maximize extent of tumor resection and, as a result, improve survival statistics. That said, it is not routine during resections to make use of similar imaging information that reflect the functional organization of the brain. Task-based fMRI has been employed as a means of pre-operatively localizing function. However, task-based fMRI depends on the patient’s ability to comply with the task paradigm, which frequently is lacking. This problem can be overcome by using the recently developed method of resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) to localize function. Moreover, rsfMRI is highly efficient, as multiple resting state networks (RSNs) associated with multiple cognitive domains can be mapped at the same time. With this in mind, the long-term goal of our research is to improve survival and quality of life after surgical resection of brain tumors by improving the identification/preservation of eloquent cortex. The current barrier that prevents the widespread use of rsfMRI is 1) the high degree of advanced imaging expertise currently necessary to create and interpret the images and 2) the necessary IT infrastructure necessary to support the analyses. To address this shortcoming, we propose to create a turnkey system for functional mapping within the brain that resides on a cloud-computing platform. At the heart of our methodology is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) algorithm that assigns RSN membership to each locus within the brain using supervised classification of rsfMRI data. Current data demonstrate that MLP-based RSN mapping is more reliable than conventional task-based fMRI and is extremely sensitive to sites identified by cortical stimulation (the standard in intraoperative mapping). Translation of the science and techniques created at Washington University will be accomplished by a deep collaboration with Radiologics, an emerging company with strong expertise in cloud computing for clinical imaging. Towards this end, the overall objective of the proposed project is to create an imaging technology package, named Cirrus, that will integrate automatic MLP-based RSN mapping with cloud-based computing. The Specific Aims of this proposal are to 1) Create Cloud-Based rsfMRI Brain Mapping Capability - Cirrus, 2) Deploy Cloud-Based rsfMRI Capability (Cirrus Platform) to New User Host Institutions, and 3) Optimize the Clinical User Interface (UI) of Cirrus. The expected outcome of this translational strategy will be an integrated imaging/surgical presurgical mapping technology using rsfMRI with clearly defined performance capabilities, well delineated localization outputs, and a clinician friendly user experience that scales to all types of health care settings. Thus, this proposal is innovative because there currently does not exist any comparable system that integrates cutting edge image analysis tools with cloud-based capabilities. This work is significant because it will disseminate technology that fundamentally enhances the surgeon’s understanding of the functional implications of their surgical strategy, thereby enables safer, more tailored approaches to improving outcomes. Project Narrative The proposed research is an academic industry partnership that will make available, to any neurosurgical practice advanced functional MRI methodology to define critical regions in the brain. This development is relevant to public health because it has the potential to improve functional outcomes following surgical removal of brain tumors. Towards this end, we propose to create an imaging technology package that will integrate 1) advanced machine learning techniques using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and 2) cloud-based computing, to perform advanced brain mapping. Thus, advanced functional localization can be standardized and acquired at any institution by being uniformly processed in the cloud and sent back to the home institution without the need for costly infrastructure. The integrated package will enable clinicians in any practice environment to efficiently and reliably visualize function on the brain’s anatomy prior to surgery.",Clinical resting state fMRI software for surgical planning,9409171,R44GM125438,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Preservation', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Excision', 'Failure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Healthcare', 'Heart', 'Home environment', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Institution', 'Intuition', 'Language', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Glioma', 'Maps', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Names', 'Network-based', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Picture Archiving and Communication System', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Quality of life', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Science', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'Stress Tests', 'Supervision', 'Surgeon', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training Activity', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tumor resection', 'clinical imaging', 'cloud based', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'functional outcomes', 'functional status', 'imaging capabilities', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'patient population', 'personalized approach', 'prevent', 'statistics', 'tool', 'translational approach', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NIGMS,"RADIOLOGICS, INC.",R44,2017,749900,0.020948419294133564
"Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This lack of progress is reflected in the continued excessive direct and indirect health care expenditure related to these conditions, largely in form of unnecessary diagnostic procedures to rule out ""organic"" disease and lack of novel, cost effective therapies. During the past funding cycle, we have identified functional alterations of brain networks in IBS patients, both in the resting state and in response to physical and psychological stimuli, which are related to sex, gene polymorphisms and a history of early adverse life events. These functional findings were accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of both white and grey matter in the brain of IBS patients resulting in a distinct ""brai signature"". In this revised competitive renewal application, I plan to take these insights to the next level by validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IB patients from healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome. Using an array of advanced, innovative brain imaging, genomic and microbiological techniques, I will address these goals in 3 Specific Aims: A. Identify disease- specific brain signatures of IBS, identify correlations of these signatures with behavioral and clinical parameters, and determine accuracy to predict IBS phenotype compared to HCs, and patients with chronic gut inflammation (ulcerative colitis). B. Identify gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and correlate with distinct brain signatures in IBS patients as identified in Aim A. C. Identify gut microbiome derived metabolites which correlate with brain signatures in IBS patients. The longitudinal design of the study combined with a mediator/moderator analysis approach will enable us to infer causality between brain, peripheral factors and symptoms, and will provide the basis for future mechanistic studies in animal models. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to improve our understanding of the complex bidirectional brain gut interactions of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS and identify biomarkers in order to develop more effective treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 15% of the U.S. population and leads to a substantial economic and societal burden. Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for IBS. This proposal is relevant to public health in that it is aimed at validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IBS patients fro healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome to provide the basis for mechanistic studies, advance our knowledge of IBS pathophysiology and aid future development of IBS therapies.",Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation,9348634,R01DK048351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Anatomy', 'Animal Model', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Metadata', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visceral', 'base', 'brain shape', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'monocyte', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,590821,0.08620936994168082
"Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. With respect to the mission of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, more complete resection reduces the burden of neurological disease by restoring function, extending life, and improving the quality of that life. With respect to surgical therapy, the deployment of visual displays that relate the patient's exposed brain within the operating room (OR) to the pre- operatively acquired neuroanatomical images has become commonplace. More specifically, surgeons can use a pen-like stylus to point at a specific feature on the patient's brain tissue and see where that tissue resides on the neuroanatomical images as facilitated by an interactive display. One detriment to this process is when the patient's brain deforms due to common surgical manipulations. As a result, the alignment between images and the patient's physical brain becomes compromised and surgical error could ensue. Over years 1-7 of this award (initial submission & first renewal), we have demonstrated that intraoperatively acquired cortical surface geometric data can be used to: improve image-to-patient alignment, measure brain deformations during surgery, and drive a computational approach to brain shift correction during image-guided neurosurgery. In this application, we take the final step of extensive intraoperative validation and independent testing. The hypothesis to be tested is that computer models, cortical surface geometric data, and tracked stylus digitization technology when used to compensate for deformation during image-guided brain tumor surgery can predict the locations of eloquent brain surround pathology such that this approach is an effective surrogate to intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. The specific aims to accomplish this are to: (1) integrate a novel computer-vision based approach to surgical field digitization within the surgical microscope and commercial guidance environment such that acquired data can drive a computer model-based approach to correct displays for deformations, (2) conduct a 20 patient retrospective validation study with independent collaborator Dr. Alex Golby of Brigham and Women's hospital comparing the results from our cortical surface deformation driven compensation pipeline to that acquired by the ""gold standard"" iMR imaging approach, (3) conduct two prospective 20 patient studies at Vanderbilt and the Brigham respectively, and evaluate intraoperative workflow, as well as the efficacy of corrected displays at institutions wit and without the presence of the iMR alternative. With respect to the importance of this work, in large part, the use of image-guided surgery for surgical resection in soft-tissue organs has been confined primarily to the cranial environment with the common understanding that 'brain shift' is a problem. With the resolution of deformations by this low-cost minimally encumbered solution, the ability to translate image-guided surgery to other soft- tissue organs could become commonplace. Furthermore, the approaches herein are inexpensive when compared to intra-operative imaging methods (e.g. MR), and scalable, i.e. capable of widespread adoption. This application could be seminal in providing the needed surrogate for the wider populations of patient that could benefit from improved 'deformation corrected' guidance but may not have access to iMR facilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. The above translates to an estimated 23,170 new cases diagnosed this year with approximately 14,080 deaths. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. More complete resection restores function, extends life, and improves the quality of that life. The goal of this project is to assist the surgeon in producing a more complete resection of brain tumors. The other important aspect is the technology we are introducing is relatively inexpensive and is amenable to widespread adoption by medical centers all across the country.",Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface,9262284,R01NS049251,"['Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Developing Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lasers', 'Life', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Mission', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Suggestion', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Error', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Wit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'anatomic imaging', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor resection', 'childhood cancer mortality', 'correctional system', 'cost', 'functional restoration', 'image guided', 'imaging approach', 'imaging modality', 'imaging potential', 'improved', 'intraoperative imaging', 'male', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'soft tissue', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NINDS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,730765,0.010583675245658022
"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9265841,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'collaborative environment', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'immunoregulation', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2017,202512,0.041346660786845284
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning.

"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. We will also disseminate our approaches through software tools and interactive web-based visualization of available data. 37",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,9332389,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Software Tools', 'Symptoms', 'Tars', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data reduction', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'design', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'independent component analysis', 'multimodality', 'multitask', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'web portal', 'white matter']",NIBIB,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2017,400000,0.0395835056125949
"Enabling Shared Analysis and Processing of Large Neurophysiology Data Project Summary / Abstract Understanding brain function is key to improving health care and advancing a number of scientific initiatives. The treatment of degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and ALS is becoming increasingly important as the current US population ages and life expectancies increase. The costs of Alzheimer's and other dementias is estimated at over $200 billion in 2016 alone, not to mention the human devastation that these diseases incur. Autism, addiction, depression, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and pain treatment are just a few more of the critically important health concerns related to brain function. Cognitive science is also at the forefront of research into computational and autonomous systems, with the potential to revolutionize human computer interaction and tackle emerging global challenges. As a result of these and other significant opportunities the BRAIN (Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies) Presidential initiative was created to improve the future health and competitiveness of the nation, with the fundamental goal of accelerating brain research. Consistent with this goal, the brain research community has developed the Neurodata Without Borders: Neurophysiology (NWB) file format and specification to support large-scale collaboration and research. This open format was created in 2014 and is already making an impact on cellular-based neurophysiology, with organizations such as the Allen Institute for Brain Science generating and sharing datasets such as the Allen Brain Observatory and the Allen Cell Types Database. Although this preliminary work is promising, progress in the research community is slowed by a lack of software tools to readily browse, process, analyse, and visualize NWB data, while promoting replicability. Thus this work aims to to produce such tools in support of the BRAIN initiative and other large-scale brain research programs by supporting and growing the NWB community. The work proposed here addresses three important workflows in cellular-based neurophysiology: o​ ptical physiology to image neurons under stimuli, silicon probe recordings to detect spike events from the surface of the cortex down through deeps​ structures, and​ in vitro slice electrophysiology to record t​ ime-varying stimulus and electrical response from a neuron​. Novel multiscale software tools will be created to enable efficient browsing, processing, analysis, and visualization of NWB-based brain data; linking experimental stimuli to observed responses. Conversion utilities will also be developed to convert existing data into NWB form. As the data is large, complex, and may be distributed across many sites, the software tools will be web-based, enabling researchers to remotely access and process data in a reproducible manner, and to use scalable cloud computing resources. The software will be released under open source licences and will be placed under formal software process to facilitate sharing across the research community. The tools will be conceived and created with the help of Allen scientists, who will also perform final validation using these three workflows. Project Narrative This research is aimed at better understanding brain function. Such knowledge may lead to improved therapies for degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson’s, and ALS; and provide new treatments for autism, addiction, depression, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and pain treatment. These studies of brain science may also yield significant insights into computing areas such as robotics and computer vision, thereby providing both healthcare and economic benefits.",Enabling Shared Analysis and Processing of Large Neurophysiology Data,9409114,R44MH115731,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Area', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Case Study', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Databases', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Ensure', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Institutes', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Licensing', 'Life Expectancy', 'Link', 'Mental Depression', 'Metadata', 'Methods', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Online Systems', 'Optics', 'Pain management', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Process', 'Pythons', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Robotics', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Services', 'Silicon', 'Site', 'Slice', 'Software Tools', 'Standardization', 'Stimulus', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'addiction', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'community based participatory research', 'computer human interaction', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data exchange', 'data format', 'data modeling', 'data sharing', 'design', 'distributed data', 'experimental study', 'falls', 'file format', 'hackathon', 'health care economics', 'improved', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'open source', 'prevent', 'programs', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'success', 'terabyte', 'tool', 'web interface', 'web-enabled']",NIMH,"KITWARE, INC.",R44,2017,747542,0.06154550781333562
"Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community. Project narrative This proposal develops a suite of advanced functional imaging pattern analysis methods, aiming to delineate heterogeneity in brain network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms, ultimately leading to early biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders. Methodologically, the proposed work leverages upon the strengths of sparse and non-negative decompositions of imaging data, which offer several advantages over conventional mass-univariate and linear multivariate methods. One of the largest and most comprehensive cohorts of 1,600 individuals ages 8 through 21 provides unique imaging and clinical data to support the application of these methods to brain development.",Pattern Analysis of fMRI via machine learning/sparse models: application to brain development,9155330,R01EB022573,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Philadelphia', 'Population', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Work', 'Youth', 'abstracting', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical biomarkers', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'follow-up', 'human data', 'improved', 'indexing', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'signal processing', 'tool', 'trend']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2016,491014,0.07267662658767331
"Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08) is to provide the candidate with extensive training in 1) machine learning, 2) neuroimaging and 3) developmental psychopathology to conduct independent investigations on the neurobiology that underlies psychopathology that results from childhood maltreatment. There is strong evidence that maltreatment during childhood results in differences across multiple circuits in the developing brain. The extent that affected circuits are involved in psychopathology, however, is unclear. Determining which circuits are involved is necessary to develop interventions that target specific neurobiological systems. The primary aims of the proposed studies are to clarify the involvement of multiple brain features (e.g., structures and functional activations) in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These aims will be accomplished with machine learning. Machine learning is a set of computer-based learning methods in which meaningful theoretical models are derived from empirical data. This proposal builds on the candidate's prior training in clinical psychology, neurobiological models of traumatic stress, and advanced computational methods to develop expertise in: 1) computational methods that include machine learning, genetic algorithms, and artificial neural networks, 2) the collection of multi-modal neuroimaging data and 3) the effect of maltreatment on development. Additional professional development training will include grantsmanship, manuscript preparation, and research ethics. To achieve these aims, the candidate has assembled an accomplished mentorship team of experts that span a range of disciplines including developmental psychopathology, computational science, and neuroscience. The training and mentorship will allow the candidate to conduct a series of research studies with two primary aims. The first is to use machine learning to develop a model that integrates structural and task-based functional MRI data to differentiate adolescents with a history of maltreatment from controls. Identifying the features that best differentiate these groups will determine which circuits are implicated in maltreatment-related psychopathology. These models will be constructed with data from an existing high-dimensional database that was obtained by project mentors. The second aim is to obtain pilot data on the association between variations in brain regions and the severity of psychopathology in a sample of maltreated adolescents. When this research is completed, the brain features most affected by maltreatment will be identified and the relation between these brain features and observable symptoms will be quantified. Such knowledge will provide a set of targets for treatment and assist in our classification of maltreatment-related mental illness. The experience and data obtained from this project will position the candidate to pursue future NIH funding to further examine the neurobiology of maltreatment- related psychopathology in adolescence.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Child abuse prior to adolescence is associated with marked impairment across the lifespan and is a significant public health concern. There is considerable need to understand how abuse in childhood affects the developing brain and how these changes correspond to observable maladaptive behaviors during adolescence. This project aims to quantify the contribution of brain circuits to maltreatment-related psychopathology in order to improve diagnosis and identify targets for intervention.        ",Evaluation of neurobiological models of adolescent maltreatment through machine learning,9108475,K08MH107661,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anhedonia', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Abuse and Neglect', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computational Science', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'E-learning', 'Engineering', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Genetic Programming', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuscripts', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentored Clinical Scientist Development Award (K08)', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Participant', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Ethics', 'Rewards', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Societies', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Therapeutic', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'base', 'career', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive control', 'computer science', 'conditioned fear', 'experience', 'gray matter', 'imaging probe', 'improved', 'learning strategy', 'maltreatment', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'putamen', 'research study', 'response', 'reward processing', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,K08,2016,190952,0.04543564662506513
"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,9058040,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2016,451650,0.009653076277742822
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders.

"Integrative Bioinformatics Approaches to Human Brain Genomics and Connectomics Project Summary (Abstract)  Human brain connectomics and imaging genomics are two emerging research fields enabled by recent advances in multi-modal neuroimaging and high throughput omics technologies. Integrating brain imaging genomics and connectomics holds great promise for a systematic characterization of both the human brain connectivity and the connectivity-based neurobiological pathway from its genetic architecture to its influences on cognition and behavior. Rich multi-modal neuroimaging data coupled with high density omics data are available from large-scale landmark studies such as the NIH Human Connectome Project (HCP) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The unprecedented scale and complexity of these data sets, however, have presented critical computational bottlenecks requiring new concepts and enabling tools.  To bridge the gap, this project is proposed to develop and validate novel integrative bioinformatics approaches to human brain genomics and connectomics, and has three aims. Aim 1 is to develop a novel computational pipeline for a systematic characterization of structural connectome optimized for imaging genomics, where special consideration will be taken to address important issues including reliable tractography and network construction, systematic extraction of network attributes, identification of important network components (e.g., hubs, communities and rich clubs), prioritization of network attributes towards genomic analysis, and identification of outcome-relevant network measures. Aim 2 is to develop novel bioinformatics strategies to determining genetic basis of structural connectome, including novel approaches for analyzing graph-based phenotype data and learning outcome-relevant associations, and an ensemble of effective learning modules to handle a comprehensive set of scenarios on mining genome-connectome associations at the genome-wide connectome-wide scale. Aim 3 is to develop a visual analytic software system for interactive visual exploration and mining of fiber-tracts and brain networks with their genetic determinants and functional outcomes, where new visualization and exploration methods will be implemented for seamlessly combining human expertise and machine intelligence to enable novel contextually meaningful discoveries.  This project is expected to produce novel bioinformatics algorithms and tools for comprehensive joint analysis of large scale genomics and connectomics data. The availability of these powerful methods and tools is critical for full knowledge discovery and exploitation of major connectomics and imaging genomics initiatives such as HCP and ADNI. In addition, they can also help enable new computational applications in many other biomedical research areas where integrative analysis of connectomics and genomics data are of interest. Via thorough test and evaluation on HCP and ADNI data, these methods and tools will be demonstrated to have considerable potential for a better understanding of the interplay between genes, brain connectivity and function, and thus be expected to impact biomedical research in general and benefit public health outcomes. Public Health Relevance (Narrative) Integrating human connectomics and brain imaging genomics offers enormous potential, allowing us to perform systems biology approaches of the brain to better understand the interplay between genes, brain connectivity, and phenotypic outcomes (e.g., cognition, behavior, disorder). This proposal seeks to develop novel bioinformatics methods and software tools for integrative study of human connectomics and brain imaging genomics.

"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,9021699,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Resected', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2016,531286,0.032492737007987896
"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,9260326,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'meetings', 'memory process', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'prevent', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress symptom', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2016,773219,0.059799634978958204
"Functional and Structural  Optical Brain Imaging Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging non-invasive imaging technique to assess the brain function. The technique is non-invasive and portable and therefore applicable in studies of children and toddlers especially those with neurodevelopmental disorders. fNIRS measurements are based on the local changes in cerebral hemodynamic levels (oxy-hemoglobin and deoxy-hemoglobin) associated with brain activity. Due to the low optical absorption of biological tissues at NIR wavelengths (700-900 nm), NIR light can penetrate deep enough to probe the cortical regions up to 1-3 cm deep. As mentioned above, the NIR absorption spectrum of the tissue is sensitive to changes in the concentration of major tissue chromophores, such as hemoglobin. Therefore, measurements of temporal variations of backscattered light can capture functionally evoked changes in the outermost cortex and can be used to assess the brain function. However, there is a need to address the changes in NIRS signal in relation with underlying physiological processes in brain such as cerebral autoregulation. In short, the mechanism of cerebral autoregulation maintains the blood flow over the range of arterial blood pressure and due to high metabolic demand of neurons it becomes a vital process for a brain function.  Devising a novel method of data processing to enrich informational content of measured characteristics from fNIRS is therefore crucial for further studies of brain function and development.  In this pilot study, we evaluated the utility of functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) in measuring cerebral hemodynamics in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in toddlers between 18 and 36 months of age.  Further, we analyzed group differences in fNIRS data in toddlers with typical development and a group of children at risk for developmental during a vanilla baseline period.  The analysis includes assessment of the hemodynamic activation, bases on changes in oxy-hemoglobin, in left and right prefrontal cortex, and the oxygenation variability (OV) index based on variability in oxygen saturation at frequencies attributed to cerebral autoregulation for each child.  In our pilot study we found that AR participants showed preliminary evidence for both more right-sided activation (2 (1)=4.2, p=0.04, =0.38) and higher differences between left and right activation (2 (1)=12, p=0.001, =0.64) compared to the TD group. In addition, AR toddlers had a significant lower overall OV index compared to children with typical development in both the left (2 (1)=9.45, p=.002, =0.57) and right PFC (2 (1)=9.15, p=.002, =0.56). It is worth mentioning that the OV index is not a direct measure of cerebral autoregulation. Rather, it is associated with frequencies related to this mechanism and serves to quantify oscillations in those frequencies. While this study suggests that some features of prefrontal hemodynamics may vary in toddlers at risk for developmental delays due to early language delay, more research in this age group is required to clarify the specificity of these differences. These preliminary findings show the feasibility of using fNIRS in typical toddlers and those with delayed development and in doing so support future studies in larger samples.  We have explored the potential prefrontal hemodynamic biomarkers to characterize subjects with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) by employing a multivariate machine learning approach and introducing a novel task-related hemodynamic response detection followed by a heuristic search for optimum set of hemodynamic features. To achieve this goal, the hemodynamic response from a group of 31 healthy controls and 30 chronic TBI subjects were recorded as they performed a complexity task. To determine the optimum hemodynamic features, we considered 11 features and their combinations in characterizing TBI subjects. We investigated the significance of the features by utilizing a machine learning classification algorithm to score all the possible combinations of features according to their predictive power. The identified optimum feature elements resulted in classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 85%, 85%, and 84%, respectively. Classification improvement was achieved for TBI subject classification through feature combination. It signified the major advantage of the multivariate analysis over the commonly used univariate analysis suggesting that the features that are individually irrelevant in characterizing the data may become relevant when used in combination. We also conducted a spatio-temporal classification to identify regions within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that contribute in distinguishing between TBI and healthy subjects. As expected, Brodmann areas (BA) 10 within the PFC were isolated as the region that healthy subjects (unlike subjects with TBI), showed major hemodynamic activity in response to the High Complexity task. Overall, our results indicate that identified temporal and spatio-temporal features from PFC's hemodynamic activity are promising biomarkers in classifying subjects with TBI. n/a",Functional and Structural  Optical Brain Imaging,9352184,ZIAHD008882,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Age-Months', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophotonics', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brodmann&apos', 's area', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Delay Disorders', 'Diffuse', 'Elements', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genus Vanilla', 'Goals', 'Hemoglobin', 'Homeostasis', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Knowledge', 'Language Delays', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Physiological Processes', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soldier', 'Specificity', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Tissues', 'Toddler', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'absorption', 'age group', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cerebral hemodynamics', 'chromophore', 'computerized data processing', 'hemodynamics', 'heuristics', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'interest', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'optical imaging', 'patient population', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NICHD,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,ZIA,2016,822591,0.03284104679138361
"Longitudinal brain development and clinical outcomes in ADHD from 7-17 years ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): ADHD is has long been believed to include brain-based pathophysiology, but the newest approaches to describing atypical brain organization in ADHD are just emerging and are thus far limited to cross-sectional studies. The present study has as its principal aims three objectives. First, it aims to characterize ADHD's brain organization longitudinally from childhood through adolescence, during a period of time in which ADHD youth enter very high risk for negative life outcomes, poor health outcomes, and comorbid behavioral, mood, and substance use disorders. In particular, the project aims to determine specified circuits, unique brain networks, and brain wide topological properties that relate to clinical course and outcome. Second, the proposal aims to bridge these developmental brain features with an enriched conception of phenotype, examining symptom domains, comorbidity, and measures of executive, reward, and emotional functioning in relation to specified brain metrics and targets. Third, it seeks to move the field forward in regard to clinica prediction by considering heterogeneity in two ways. One way is to examine novel typologies of ADHD based on differential brain organization across development. The other way is to utilize multiple methods to enhance prediction of clinical course. The significance of this effort lies bot in its unprecedented ability to characterize ADHD neurobiology over time with methods of brain characterization that have not been examined in ADHD longitudinally in this way before, and in its effort to move brain imaging into the realm of clinical prediction using a longitudinal design. The project is innovative in regard to implementing network and topology features of brain analysis in a multi-wave design, and tightly linking these to well defined, multi-level clinical course. The approach entails tracking of an already developed novel cohort of 376 children in a cross-lagged longitudinal design, enabling characterization of development from age 7-19 years. Brain organization will be operationalized with both diffusion tensor imaging and resting state functional connectivity. Youth will be characterized annually in relation to clinical symptoms, comorbidity, impairment, cognitive functioning, reward discounting, and emotion regulation and functioning. Analytic approaches will span brain circuit, network, and topological measurements using novel graph theoretical analyses to characterize brain systems. Clinical prediction will be undertaken using machine learning methodologies. Clinical typologies will be evaluated using both novel community detection procedures and more standard mixture model analysis of brain features. Finally, latent class trajectory models will be used to identify distint developmental types of ADHD if they exist. The prior grant period has been productive and this work builds on those findings to strengthen inference regarding the relation of brain organization to ADHD clinical features, course, and outcome. The Aims directly match key priorities of the NIMH strategic plan. If successful, the project hopes to break the impasse facing the field with regard to clinical utility of the growing grasp of atypical brain physiology in ADHD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Much has been learned about brain correlates of ADHD, but this work has not yet affected clinical practice. The present project would characterize individual variation in ADHD brain development and attempt to use those findings to enhance clinical prediction. It thus aims to move the field closer to clinical application of brain imaging information of ADHD.",Longitudinal brain development and clinical outcomes in ADHD from 7-17 years,9208912,R56MH086654,"['19 year old', 'Adolescence', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Alcohol or Other Drugs use', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Comorbidity', 'Conceptions', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Developmental Course', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease remission', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Incentives', 'Individual', 'Informal Social Control', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurobiology', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Strategic Planning', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'Symptoms', 'Syndrome', 'System', 'Thick', 'Time', 'To specify', 'Typology', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Youth', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'design', 'discounting', 'emotion regulation', 'graph theory', 'grasp', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inattention', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'predict clinical outcome', 'public health relevance', 'time use']",NIMH,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R56,2016,769969,0.08853980918132343
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes Project Summary Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by repetitive and stereotyped be- havior and difﬁculties in communication and social interaction. It is now one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders in childhood, but it is also a lifelong condition, adversely affecting an individual's social relationships, independence and employment well into adult. A major barrier to creating effective treatments for autism is the lack of understanding of the speciﬁc brain mechanisms involved and how these are related to speciﬁc behavioral symptoms.  We propose to develop novel statistical methods for combining heterogeneous imaging and behavioral data to understand how properties of complex brain networks give rise to behavioral phenotypes in autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders. The ﬁrst contribution of this project is to develop novel image analysis methods to extract individualized features of complex brain networks from imaging data. This includes powerful method for describing the shape of gray matter in brain networks based on diffeomorphic image registration and a rigorous method for inferring an individual's functional connectivity based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. The next contribution is a novel method to capture the topology of brain networks simultaneously across all scale levels of connection strength. Finally, we will develop Bayesian statistical methods for ﬁnding correlations in high- dimensional and heterogeneous data, and we will use this to analyze the relationship between brain networks and behavior. This project includes a strong collaborative and multi-disciplinary team with expertise in computer science, statistical data analysis, neuroimaging, and clinical autism care. A primary goal of this project is to create open-source software that is used by the neuroscience community to advance research in understanding the brain basis of behavior in neuropsychiatric disorders. Project Narrative This grant is focused on developing novel analysis of complex brain networks from structural and functional imaging and using this to link brain features to behavioral phenotypes. These algorithms will be used to discover brain biomarkers of behavioral traits in Autism and other neuropsychiatric disorders.","Beyond Diagnostic Classification of Autism: Neuroanatomical, Functional, and Behavioral Phenotypes",9170673,R01EB022876,"['Adult', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Symptoms', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Childhood', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Descriptor', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Employment', 'Evaluation', 'Formulation', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Interview', 'Least-Squares Analysis', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Network-based', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Schedule', 'Series', 'Severities', 'Shapes', 'Social Interaction', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyped Behavior', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain shape', 'computer science', 'data integration', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'gray matter', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'open source', 'social', 'trait']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF UTAH,R01,2016,377500,0.04377801283430124
"Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience. We will disseminate our algorithms and software to the research community via NITRC . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function and dysfunction. Although fMRI studies of brain function have primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of perceptual or cognitive tasks, there is growing consensus that cognitive functions emerge as a result of dynamic context-dependent interactions between multiple brain areas. Developing new computational methods for investigating causal interactions in fMRI data has therefore taken added significance; the overall goal of this proposal is to address this critical need by developing new methods for studying causal interactions and brain connectivity between distributed brain regions during cognition.",Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction,9086441,R01NS086085,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Basal Ganglia', 'Base of the Brain', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data to Knowledge', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Computational Science', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Consensus', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Experimental Genetics', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual Differences', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Markov Chains', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Parietal', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resource Sharing', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Software Tools', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'base', 'brain dysfunction', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive load', 'cognitive process', 'cognitive system', 'cognitive task', 'computerized tools', 'connectome', 'disability', 'dynamic system', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mortality', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'optogenetics', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'simulation', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NINDS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,554411,0.06887168784502558
"Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This lack of progress is reflected in the continued excessive direct and indirect health care expenditure related to these conditions, largely in form of unnecessary diagnostic procedures to rule out ""organic"" disease and lack of novel, cost effective therapies. During the past funding cycle, we have identified functional alterations of brain networks in IBS patients, both in the resting state and in response to physical and psychological stimuli, which are related to sex, gene polymorphisms and a history of early adverse life events. These functional findings were accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of both white and grey matter in the brain of IBS patients resulting in a distinct ""brai signature"". In this revised competitive renewal application, I plan to take these insights to the next level by validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IB patients from healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome. Using an array of advanced, innovative brain imaging, genomic and microbiological techniques, I will address these goals in 3 Specific Aims: A. Identify disease- specific brain signatures of IBS, identify correlations of these signatures with behavioral and clinical parameters, and determine accuracy to predict IBS phenotype compared to HCs, and patients with chronic gut inflammation (ulcerative colitis). B. Identify gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and correlate with distinct brain signatures in IBS patients as identified in Aim A. C. Identify gut microbiome derived metabolites which correlate with brain signatures in IBS patients. The longitudinal design of the study combined with a mediator/moderator analysis approach will enable us to infer causality between brain, peripheral factors and symptoms, and will provide the basis for future mechanistic studies in animal models. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to improve our understanding of the complex bidirectional brain gut interactions of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS and identify biomarkers in order to develop more effective treatment strategies. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 15% of the U.S. population and leads to a substantial economic and societal burden. Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for IBS. This proposal is relevant to public health in that it is aimed at validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IBS patients fro healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome to provide the basis for mechanistic studies, advance our knowledge of IBS pathophysiology and aid future development of IBS therapies.",Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation,9113551,R01DK048351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Animal Model', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Metadata', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visceral', 'base', 'brain shape', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'microbiota', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'patient subsets', 'peripheral blood', 'potential biomarker', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,606065,0.08620936994168082
"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,9067148,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain health', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'heart rate monitor', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature neonates', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2016,642962,0.07119965167993628
"Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. With respect to the mission of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, more complete resection reduces the burden of neurological disease by restoring function, extending life, and improving the quality of that life. With respect to surgical therapy, the deployment of visual displays that relate the patient's exposed brain within the operating room (OR) to the pre- operatively acquired neuroanatomical images has become commonplace. More specifically, surgeons can use a pen-like stylus to point at a specific feature on the patient's brain tissue and see where that tissue resides on the neuroanatomical images as facilitated by an interactive display. One detriment to this process is when the patient's brain deforms due to common surgical manipulations. As a result, the alignment between images and the patient's physical brain becomes compromised and surgical error could ensue. Over years 1-7 of this award (initial submission & first renewal), we have demonstrated that intraoperatively acquired cortical surface geometric data can be used to: improve image-to-patient alignment, measure brain deformations during surgery, and drive a computational approach to brain shift correction during image-guided neurosurgery. In this application, we take the final step of extensive intraoperative validation and independent testing. The hypothesis to be tested is that computer models, cortical surface geometric data, and tracked stylus digitization technology when used to compensate for deformation during image-guided brain tumor surgery can predict the locations of eloquent brain surround pathology such that this approach is an effective surrogate to intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. The specific aims to accomplish this are to: (1) integrate a novel computer-vision based approach to surgical field digitization within the surgical microscope and commercial guidance environment such that acquired data can drive a computer model-based approach to correct displays for deformations, (2) conduct a 20 patient retrospective validation study with independent collaborator Dr. Alex Golby of Brigham and Women's hospital comparing the results from our cortical surface deformation driven compensation pipeline to that acquired by the ""gold standard"" iMR imaging approach, (3) conduct two prospective 20 patient studies at Vanderbilt and the Brigham respectively, and evaluate intraoperative workflow, as well as the efficacy of corrected displays at institutions wit and without the presence of the iMR alternative. With respect to the importance of this work, in large part, the use of image-guided surgery for surgical resection in soft-tissue organs has been confined primarily to the cranial environment with the common understanding that 'brain shift' is a problem. With the resolution of deformations by this low-cost minimally encumbered solution, the ability to translate image-guided surgery to other soft- tissue organs could become commonplace. Furthermore, the approaches herein are inexpensive when compared to intra-operative imaging methods (e.g. MR), and scalable, i.e. capable of widespread adoption. This application could be seminal in providing the needed surrogate for the wider populations of patient that could benefit from improved 'deformation corrected' guidance but may not have access to iMR facilities.

Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30.

More complete resection restores function, extends life, and improves the quality of that life. The goal of this project is to assist the surgeon in producing a more complete resection of brain tumors.

"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity        ",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9108126,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Anti-inflammatory', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'collaborative environment', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'indexing', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2016,190342,0.041346660786845284
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, involving a complicated interplay between functional information interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. func- tional and structural measures. However the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities is to miss a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimensional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we developed approaches based on multiset canonical correlation analysis (mCCA) and joint independent compo- nent analysis (jICA) that can capture high-dimensional, linear, relationships among 2 or more modalities, and which we showed can identify both modality-unique and modality-common features that are predictive of dis- ease. In this new phase of the project we will focus on two important areas. First, we will build on our previous success by extending our models to allow for incorporation of behavioral/cognitive constraints as well as devel- oping new approaches which leverage recent advances in deep learning enabling us to capture higher order relationships embedded in multimodal and multitask data. Secondly, we will address the key challenge of inte- grating possibly thousands of multimodal features by developing a new meta-modality framework which will enable us to bring together the existing and new features in an intuitive manner. This will also enable us to capture changes in multimodal information which might not be harmful separately but which together are jointly sufficient to convey risk of illness or to identify information flow through the meta-modal space for developing potential targets for treatment. We will apply these approaches to one of the largest multimodal imaging datasets of psychosis and mood disorders. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly evaluated using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symptoms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar de- pression). As before, we will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via a web portal and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 36 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and we have shown the power of linear joint N-way analysis during the previous funding period. However this is just the beginning. In this renewal, we will build on and significantly expand the goals of the original aims by incorporating additional joint information (including dynamic and potentially nonlinear factors) as well as a framework for integrating the resulting information in order to enable decision making and identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. We will also disseminate our approaches through software tools and interactive web-based visualization of available data. 37",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,9185800,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imagery', 'Imaging technology', 'Joints', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Online Systems', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Series', 'Shipping', 'Ships', 'Software Tools', 'Symptoms', 'Tars', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Work', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data reduction', 'data sharing', 'deep field survey', 'design', 'gray matter', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'multitask', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'success', 'tool', 'web portal', 'white matter change']",NIBIB,THE MIND RESEARCH NETWORK,R01,2016,400000,0.0395835056125949

"4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging allows safe, non-invasive measurement of brain structures and functions and their changes over time. This has led to many longitudinal studies to discover imaging biomarkers for better prediction of brain disorders. However, the associated longitudinal changes are often tiny within a short follow-up time, and are thus difficult to detect by conventional methods since the measurement errors could be larger than the actual changes. Also, with the significant increase of data with longitudinal follow-ups, it becomes challenging to capture a small set of effective imaging biomarkers from large data for accurate disease prediction. This issue becomes even more critical when there is missing data in the longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. The goal of this renewal project is to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. These tools wil allow elucidating subtle abnormal changes that would be otherwise left undetected with existing tools. Specifically, in Aim 1, we will create a novel multi-atlas guided 4D brain labelling method for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject. All longitudinal images of each subject will be first aligned by a novel groupwise 4D registration algorithm that can more accurately estimate longitudinal deformations. Then, these aligned longitudinal images can be further registered with multiple atlases guided by a graph that locally connects all (subject and atlas) images, thus obtaining more accurate/consistent registration and ROI labeling for the longitudinal images of same subject. In Aim 2, we will further create a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model to effectively integrate serial imaging and non-imaging biomarkers for early diagnosis and prediction of brain status. Also, to further extract effective biomarkers, a new machine learning technique, called deep learning, will be adapted to learn high-level features for helping prediction with a novel temporally-constrained group sparse learning method, which is able to predict clinical scores consistently for future time-points. Finally, in Aim 3, we will create nove methods to deal with missing data in longitudinal study, which is unavoidable in clinical application. In particular, we will first develop several data completion methods (including matrix completion) to complete the missing data. Then, instead of designing a single predictor that may be limited, we will design multiple diverse predictors (by multi-task learning) for ensemble prediction, thus significantly increasing the overall prediction performance. Also, considering that the individual's future images are not available at early time-points, to improve the clinical utility of the proposed methods, we will apply our models to various cases with different numbers of longitudinal images and then further train them jointly to achieve the overall best performance. Note that the performance of all proposed methods will be evaluated in this project for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study, although they are also applicable to studies of other brain disorders.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project aims to create a set of innovative 4D software tools that are dedicated to more effective early diagnosis and prediction of brain disorders with longitudinal data. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel multi-atlases guided 4D brain labelling framework for consistent and accurate labeling of Regions of Interest (ROIs) across the longitudinal images (4D image) of the same subject by harnessing the manifold of anatomical variation of 4D image and the atlases, 2) a multimodal, sparse longitudinal prediction model that will automatically learn the relevant information from imaging and non-imaging data of past time-points to predict future status of brain, and 3) novel methods for missing data completion and then multiple diverse predictors for ensemble prediction. We will also make these methods practical for clinical diagnostics setting. Finally, we will package all our methods into a softwar tool and release it publicly, as we have done before. The methods that we will develop can find their applications not only in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that will be used as example in this project, but also in other fields such as longitudinal monitoring of other neurological diseases (i.e., schizophrenia) and measuring the effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain.            ",4D Software Tools for Longitudinal Prediction of Brain Disease,8814543,R01EB008374,"['4D Imaging', 'Accounting', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Atlases', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Noise', 'Outcome', 'Performance', 'Schizophrenia', 'Software Tools', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical application', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'follow-up', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multitask', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,477101,0.009653076277742822
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders.

"A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment of intractable focal epilepsy by resection of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) is often effective provided the SOZ can be reliably identified. Focal epilepsy, however, is fundamentally a network-based disease. The seizure onset zone is connected to a network whose other nodes may also exhibit abnormal neural activity either concurrently or subsequently. In patients without MRI detectable lesions, differentiation of the onset zone from these other nodes in the network can be difficult, even with the use of invasive recordings. The goal of this project is to improve SOZ identification, ultimately reducing the need for presurgical invasive recordings where possible, and guiding placement of electrodes in those patients who do need invasive monitoring. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1 we will build a functional connectivity atlas from a database of invasive Cortico-Cortical Evoked Potential (CCEP) recordings to identify common interaction networks in patients with partial epilepsy and to investigate the degree to which these are dependent on the location of the SOZ. To construct the atlas, patient data will be coregistered to a labelled anatomical atlas using a cortically constrained warping of each subject's structural MRI. In Aim 2, CCEPs data will be supplemented in the atlas with other data that provide additional insight into the brain regions involved in the seizure: regions of hypometabolism in interictal FDG PET, hypermetabolism in ictal SPECT, interictal spike localization from EEG and MEG and invasive recordings, functional areas associated with seizure semiology, MR-identified lesions, area of resection, post-surgical Engel classification. Using machine-learning methods, we will perform a sequence of tests to examine the degree to which the atlas can be used to identify the SOZ in individual subjects. Finally, in Aim 3, we will investigate the potential for using regional connectivity established frm noninvasive MEG data and resting state MRI in combination with the CCEPs atlas to identify these networks, with the ultimate goal of reducing the need for invasive monitoring. Retrospective analysis using a leave-one- out approach and comparison with outcomes will be used to quantify improvement in identification of the onset zone from both invasive and noninvasive recordings.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Epilepsy affects millions of Americans, and for many, surgery is the best option to control their seizures. Improved surgical outcomes, however, requires a better understanding of the brain networks involved in seizure propagation. A brain atlas using data recorded from electrodes implanted in patients will yield new insights into pathways of the brain and will ultimately assist neurologists and neurosurgeons in better localizing and resecting the area of the brain that is causing seizures.            ",A Brain Atlas for Mapping Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy,8900645,R01NS089212,"['Address', 'Affect', 'American', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Categories', 'Classification', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epilepsy', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Excision', 'Exhibits', 'Frontal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Implant', 'Implanted Electrodes', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Left', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Monitor', 'Network-based', 'Neurologist', 'Neurosurgeon', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Resected', 'Rest', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'brain pathway', 'density', 'fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'novel', 'preimplantation', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'single photon emission computed tomography']",NINDS,CLEVELAND CLINIC LERNER COM-CWRU,R01,2015,552097,0.032492737007987896
"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables. Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Functional and Structural  Optical Brain Imaging Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an emerging non-invasive imaging technique to assess the brain function. The technique is non-invasive and portable and therefore applicable in studies of children and toddlers especially those with neurodevelopmental disorders. fNIRS measurements are based on the local changes in cerebral hemodynamic levels (oxy-hemoglobin and deoxy-hemoglobin) associated with brain activity. Due to the low optical absorption of biological tissues at NIR wavelengths (700-900 nm), NIR light can penetrate deep enough to probe the cortical regions up to 1-3 cm deep. As mentioned above, the NIR absorption spectrum of the tissue is sensitive to changes in the concentration of major tissue chromophores, such as hemoglobin. Therefore, measurements of temporal variations of backscattered light can capture functionally evoked changes in the outermost cortex and can be used to assess the brain function. However, there is a need to address the changes in NIRS signal in relation with underlying physiological processes in brain such as cerebral autoregulation. In short, mechanism of cerebral autoregulation maintains the blood flow over the range of arterial blood pressure and due to high metabolic demand of neurons it becomes a vital process for a brain function.  Devising a novel method of data processing to enrich informational content of measured characteristics from fNIRS is therefore crucial for further studies of brain function and development.  In the current study, we introduced the novel parameter, Oxygenation Variability index (OV Index), directly obtained from fNIRS data to quantify the changes in oxygen saturation at frequencies related to cerebral autoregulation (CA). In our study we use two frequency bands (<0.1 Hz, related to process of cerebral autoregulation and 0.2-0.3 Hz, related to dynamic of respiration to examine the changes in OV index with age in group of typically developing children. We hypothesize that the OV index will reveal differences based on chronological age as seen in the extant literature on cerebral hemodynamics in children during the performance of the functional task. We first investigated the relationship between age and OV Index, for frequencies <0.1 Hz, during the ask, and rest conditions and found a significant quadratic relationship, for frequencies <0.1 Hz, across task F(14) = 10.6, p = 0.006. We investigated both linear and nonlinear trends for the respiration frequencies (.2-.3 Hz), and found no significant change of OV index with age Linear: F(15) = 0.98, p = 0.34; Quadratic: F(14) = 0.01, p = 0.91. The OV index values were higher for frequencies <0.1 Hz, for Task when compared to rest F(16) = 5.3, p = 0.04, F(16) = 8.3, p = 0.01, respectively. This finding is in line with those showing increases in efficiency of CA during completion of cognitive tasks (Panerai et al., 2005). Furthermore, we have extended our analysis to children and toddler in both typical and language delay group between age of 18-36 months old to better understand the physiological development and impairments related to language delay at the early age.  We have also examined the brain function using other non-invasive methods such as electroencephalogram (EEG) to examine the functional connectivity in brain. We have employed a new approach to trace the dynamic patterns of human brain task-based functional connectivity with EEG. The EEG signals of 5 healthy subjects were recorded while they performed an auditory oddball and a visual modified oddball tasks. To capture the dynamic patterns of functional connectivity during the execution of each task, EEG signals are segmented into duration that correspond to the temporal windows of previously well-studied event-related potentials (ERPs). For each task, the proposed approach was able to establish a unique sequence of dynamic pattern (observed in all 5 subjects) for brain functional connectivity. We have also introduced and validated a novel time series feature extraction technique, Relative Brain Signature (RBS) that can be applied on ERP signals to provide an effective dimensionality reduction, which does not require the typical channel selection procedure and accounts for all the ERP signals. Unlike common feature extraction techniques, RBS technique obtains information from subjects ERP by considering the status of their relationship to the given population of the study. RBS combines vector space analysis and orthogonal subspace projection to generate feature vectors that signify the corresponding population of the subjects. The proposed technique can be used to identify the biomarkers related to a specific population and to localize functional biomarkers.   Furthermore, we have explored the potential prefrontal hemodynamic biomarkers to characterize subjects with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) by introducing a novel task-related hemodynamic response detection followed by a heuristic search for optimum set of hemodynamic features. The hemodynamic response from a group of 31 healthy controls and 30 chronic TBI subjects were recorded as they performed a complexity task (i.e. number of events). To identify the hemodynamic signals that show task-related hemodynamic activity, trials with negatively correlated HbO and HbR and HbO larger than HbR were considered for analysis. For identifying the optimum hemodynamic features, unlike common single feature analysis for studying TBI and healthy subjects, we evaluated all possible combinations of multiple hemodynamic features to compare the TBI and healthy populations. Eleven hemodynamic features were extracted from oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) to determine the optimum set of biomarkers. We investigated the effectiveness of the extracted features in separating TBI and healthy subjects by utilizing a machine learning classification algorithm to score all the possible combinations of features according to their predictive power. The identified optimum feature elements resulted in classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 85%, 85%, and 84%, respectively. The sensitivity value of 85% suggests that TBI subjects have been successfully characterized for the identified biomarkers with reasonable accuracy. We conducted a spatio-temporal classification to identify regions within the prefrontal cortex (PFC) that contribute in distinguishing between TBI and healthy subjects. As expected, Brodmann areas (BA) 10 within the PFC was isolated as the region that healthy subjects (unlike subjects with TBI), showed major hemodynamic activity in response to the High Complexity task. Overall, our results indicate that identified temporal and spatio-temporal features from PFCs hemodynamic activity are promising biomarkers in classifying subjects with TBI. n/a",Functional and Structural  Optical Brain Imaging,9150152,ZIAHD008882,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Auditory', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophotonics', 'Blood Pressure', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brodmann&apos', 's area', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Chronic', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diffuse', 'Effectiveness', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Elements', 'Epilepsy', 'Event', 'Event-Related Potentials', 'Fiber', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Hematoma', 'Hemispherectomy', 'Hemoglobin', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Impairment', 'Knowledge', 'Language Delays', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Near-Infrared Spectroscopy', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Optics', 'Oxygen', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Relative (related person)', 'Respiration', 'Rest', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Soldier', 'TBI Patients', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toddler', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Triage', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'absorption', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'chromophore', 'cognitive task', 'computerized data processing', 'detector', 'hemodynamics', 'heuristics', 'imaging system', 'indexing', 'instrument', 'interest', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'optical imaging', 'patient population', 'prototype', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'temporal measurement', 'tool', 'trend', 'vector']",NICHD,EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH & HUMAN DEVELOPMENT,ZIA,2015,682022,0.008061457390491264
"Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience. We will disseminate our algorithms and software to the research community via NITRC .

"Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This lack of progress is reflected in the continued excessive direct and indirect health care expenditure related to these conditions, largely in form of unnecessary diagnostic procedures to rule out ""organic"" disease and lack of novel, cost effective therapies. During the past funding cycle, we have identified functional alterations of brain networks in IBS patients, both in the resting state and in response to physical and psychological stimuli, which are related to sex, gene polymorphisms and a history of early adverse life events. These functional findings were accompanied by extensive structural remodeling of both white and grey matter in the brain of IBS patients resulting in a distinct ""brai signature"". In this revised competitive renewal application, I plan to take these insights to the next level by validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IB patients from healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome. Using an array of advanced, innovative brain imaging, genomic and microbiological techniques, I will address these goals in 3 Specific Aims: A. Identify disease- specific brain signatures of IBS, identify correlations of these signatures with behavioral and clinical parameters, and determine accuracy to predict IBS phenotype compared to HCs, and patients with chronic gut inflammation (ulcerative colitis). B. Identify gene expression profiles in peripheral blood monocytic cells (PBMCs) and correlate with distinct brain signatures in IBS patients as identified in Aim A. C. Identify gut microbiome derived metabolites which correlate with brain signatures in IBS patients. The longitudinal design of the study combined with a mediator/moderator analysis approach will enable us to infer causality between brain, peripheral factors and symptoms, and will provide the basis for future mechanistic studies in animal models. The long-term goal of the proposed studies is to improve our understanding of the complex bidirectional brain gut interactions of the brain gut microbiome axis in IBS and identify biomarkers in order to develop more effective treatment strategies.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) affects up to 15% of the U.S. population and leads to a substantial economic and societal burden. Despite extensive research efforts during the past decades, there is no general agreement about pathophysiology, or reliable biomarkers for IBS. This proposal is relevant to public health in that it is aimed at validating the accuracy of structural/functional brain signatures to differentiate IBS patients fro healthy and from disease control subjects, and by identifying associations of brain signatures with changes in the peripheral immune system and the gut microbiome to provide the basis for mechanistic studies, advance our knowledge of IBS pathophysiology and aid future development of IBS therapies.            ",Perception and Modulation of Visceral Sensation,8926075,R01DK048351,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Agreement', 'Animal Model', 'Arousal', 'Behavioral', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood Cells', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Emotional', 'Esthesia', 'Etiology', 'Event', 'Feces', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Health Expenditures', 'Human', 'Immune system', 'Inflammatory disease of the intestine', 'Intestines', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Life Stress', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Metadata', 'Microbiological Techniques', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perception', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Ulcerative Colitis', 'Visceral', 'base', 'brain shape', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'cost effective', 'disorder control', 'effective therapy', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'gut microbiota', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'longitudinal design', 'metabolomics', 'microbiome', 'monocyte', 'novel', 'peripheral blood', 'psychologic', 'public health relevance', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'treatment strategy', 'treatment trial', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2015,643700,0.08620936994168082
"FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging studies of depression have suggested aberrant brain network relationships in this disorder. Despite these compelling findings there have been very few investigations examining the developmental timing of these alterations in children experiencing the earliest known form of depression, Preschool Depression (PD). The purpose of this mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the applicant with the skills and experience necessary to begin filling this knowledge gap. The unique mentorship and training opportunities available to the applicant complement his strong background in clinical psychology and research with clinical populations. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop an independent programmatic line of research investigating the developmental neurobiology of depression. To facilitate this goal, instruction and mentoring are proposed in 1) applying a systematic approach to the study of functional brain network development in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 2) methods for studying the relationships between brain networks and behavior in PD and 3) methods for studying the convergence between network organization and task based fMRI activity in PD. An expert interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants will support the proposed research and training plan. The feasibility of the proposed award is enhanced by the availability of a large set of fMRI data from an ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging study of school age children with a history of PD and their same age healthy peers (NIMH MH090786) as well as a high level of success in obtaining pilot fMRI data from healthy and depressed preschoolers (4-6 years old). Using these samples, a systematic approach investigating functional brain networks at the level of individual brain regions or region pairs, targeted subnetworks, and whole brain networks (using graph theory methods) is planned for aim 1. As a second aim, the behavioral correlates associated with group differences identified in aim 1 will be examined. Patterns of overlap between group differences in brain network organization and fMRI task-based activity during an emotion face-viewing paradigm (collected in the same individuals) will be the focus of a planned exploratory aim. It is hypothesized that 1) PD will be associated with disrupted Default Mode Network connectivity 2) atypical network organization will be related to depression severity and emotion regulation difficulties in PD and 3) a high level of overlap between network and task based group differences will be present. The study of brain networks in PD may reveal unique and early occurring neurobiological markers of risk for continued mood difficulties and/or later depression; information potentially critical for developing novel preventative treatments aimed at minimizing depression's public health burden. The complimentary training and research plans proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition into an independent researc career addressing NIMH research priorities that emphasize discoveries in the brain and behavioral sciences (Strategic Plan) and the study of brain networks in psychopathology (RDoC). The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder. Despite growing recognition of depression as a 'network illness', there have been very few studies examining functional brain network organization in children with very early occurring depression. Such studies could lead to the earlier identification of children who will later develop MDD and inform new preventive treatment efforts aimed at minimizing the significant burden of this important public health issue. Thus, the proposed award addresses important federal research priorities aimed at reducing the impact of depression on public health.",FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION,8880280,K23MH098176,"['6 year old', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Sciences', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Psychology', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Crying', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Medicine', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Dorsal', 'Early identification', 'Educational Curriculum', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Ethical Issues', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Fellowship', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Instruction', 'Investigation', 'K-Series Research Career Programs', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Moods', 'Movement', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Nursery Schools', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preventive', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Activity', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Priority', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Risk Marker', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'School-Age Population', 'Seeds', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Strategic Planning', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Training Activity', 'Training Programs', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Washington', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'case control', 'child depression', 'clinically significant', 'cognitive control', 'depressive symptoms', 'developmental neurobiology', 'early childhood', 'early experience', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional behavior', 'experience', 'innovation', 'interest', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'patient oriented', 'peer', 'programs', 'skills', 'success', 'theories', 'tool', 'treatment response']",NIMH,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K23,2015,131037,0.038618763275352894
"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8856234,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2015,614823,0.07119965167993628
"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.

"Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. With respect to the mission of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, more complete resection reduces the burden of neurological disease by restoring function, extending life, and improving the quality of that life. With respect to surgical therapy, the deployment of visual displays that relate the patient's exposed brain within the operating room (OR) to the pre- operatively acquired neuroanatomical images has become commonplace. More specifically, surgeons can use a pen-like stylus to point at a specific feature on the patient's brain tissue and see where that tissue resides on the neuroanatomical images as facilitated by an interactive display. One detriment to this process is when the patient's brain deforms due to common surgical manipulations. As a result, the alignment between images and the patient's physical brain becomes compromised and surgical error could ensue. Over years 1-7 of this award (initial submission & first renewal), we have demonstrated that intraoperatively acquired cortical surface geometric data can be used to: improve image-to-patient alignment, measure brain deformations during surgery, and drive a computational approach to brain shift correction during image-guided neurosurgery. In this application, we take the final step of extensive intraoperative validation and independent testing. The hypothesis to be tested is that computer models, cortical surface geometric data, and tracked stylus digitization technology when used to compensate for deformation during image-guided brain tumor surgery can predict the locations of eloquent brain surround pathology such that this approach is an effective surrogate to intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. The specific aims to accomplish this are to: (1) integrate a novel computer-vision based approach to surgical field digitization within the surgical microscope and commercial guidance environment such that acquired data can drive a computer model-based approach to correct displays for deformations, (2) conduct a 20 patient retrospective validation study with independent collaborator Dr. Alex Golby of Brigham and Women's hospital comparing the results from our cortical surface deformation driven compensation pipeline to that acquired by the ""gold standard"" iMR imaging approach, (3) conduct two prospective 20 patient studies at Vanderbilt and the Brigham respectively, and evaluate intraoperative workflow, as well as the efficacy of corrected displays at institutions wit and without the presence of the iMR alternative. With respect to the importance of this work, in large part, the use of image-guided surgery for surgical resection in soft-tissue organs has been confined primarily to the cranial environment with the common understanding that 'brain shift' is a problem. With the resolution of deformations by this low-cost minimally encumbered solution, the ability to translate image-guided surgery to other soft- tissue organs could become commonplace. Furthermore, the approaches herein are inexpensive when compared to intra-operative imaging methods (e.g. MR), and scalable, i.e. capable of widespread adoption. This application could be seminal in providing the needed surrogate for the wider populations of patient that could benefit from improved 'deformation corrected' guidance but may not have access to iMR facilities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. The above translates to an estimated 23,170 new cases diagnosed this year with approximately 14,080 deaths. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. More complete resection restores function, extends life, and improves the quality of that life. The goal of this project is to assist the surgeon in producing a more complete resection of brain tumors. The other important aspect is the technology we are introducing is relatively inexpensive and is amenable to widespread adoption by medical centers all across the country.",Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface,8843052,R01NS049251,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lasers', 'Life', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Mission', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Error', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Wit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor resection', 'cost', 'functional restoration', 'image guided', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'intraoperative imaging', 'male', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prospective', 'soft tissue', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NINDS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,716624,0.010583675245658022
"CONNECTOMICS IN PSYCHIATRIC CLASSIFICATION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Traditional conceptualization of mental disorders based on phenomenology is increasingly recognized as limited, but to date, we have lacked a clear path forward toward a more valid approach. Clinical heterogeneity and the imprecise nature of nosological distinctions represent fundamentally confounding factors limiting a better understanding of etiology, prevention and treatment. Neural connectivity of the major psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) has been variable across studies, which inarguably reflect multiple disease processes with distinct etiologies and overlapping clinical manifestations. Connectomics is an umbrella term that refers to scientific attempts to accurately map the set of neural elements and connections comprising the brain collectively referred to as the human connectome. Our application promises to uncover latent, homogenous, connectivity phenotypes using neuroimaging tools, which are free from the limitations of traditional diagnostic boundaries, and which correlate with clinical manifestations. SZ, BP and healthy control subjects will be scanned using the state-of-the-art ""Connectome Skyra"", an optimized MRI scanner used by the NIH Human Connectome Project at Washington University, to obtain exceptionally high-resolution brain diffusion and functional connectivity images. We aim to identify brain signatures and network patterns that relate to psychosis, affectivity and cognitive deficits across all groups using diffusion MRI and resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Our classification methods will employ computational tools that include graph theory and support vector machine based pattern classification to derive multiple segregate clusters of individuals with unique patterns of behavioral/cognitive profiles and brain connectivity. We will also use the novel unsupervised method of ""Non-Negative Matrix Factorization-Based Biclustering"", which we developed for use on neuroimaging datasets to identify subgroups based on patterns of whole brain connectivity following voxelwise deconstruction of the entire brain's white matter tracts. Our application benefits from its multi-disciplinary collaborators and consultants, including several key investigators from the Human Connectome Project.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Results from our studies would have a significant impact on those with mental disorders.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.  This project examines whether signals recorded directly from the human brain (during surgery for epilepsy) could be used to control a robotic hand.

"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.          Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC). Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available.

"Action for Health in Diabetes Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ancillary Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preservation of brain health is a critical goal in the care of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who are at increased risk for atrophy, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. Weight loss and increased physical activity hold promise as potentially effective strategies for this purpose, but are currently unproven in any population. Because unintended weight loss often precedes declines in later life brain health, a randomized controlled clinical trial is necessary, which must feature an effective behavioral intervention that is sustained over a long period of time in a large well characterized cohort. Mounting such a program de novo would be very expensive. Instead, we propose to make use of the ongoing and very successful Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) randomized controlled clinical trial, adding cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to its extensive data collection protocol. This is feasible: participants in clinical trials have been repeatedly shown to be willing to join brain imaging studies and we have developed successful protocols for maintaining safety, confidentiality, and quality. This is novel: Look AHEAD and the state-of-the-art MRI protocols that we propose provide an unprecedented opportunity to assess the long-term effectiveness of mid-life behavioral changes on brain structure and function and to advance understanding of brain health in diabetes. We address an important public health priority for a rapidly growing and under-studied segment of the US population in a cost-effective manner, leveraging the extensive research resources available from Look AHEAD. We respond to PAR-09-247, which targets ancillary study applications to major NIDDK clinical trials, including Look AHEAD. We will enroll 496 participants, ages 55-85 years with type 2 diabetes, from 3 Look AHEAD clinics. They will have been randomly assigned 10 years ago when they were obese or overweight, with equal probability, to either an ongoing intensive lifestyle intervention that has induced sustained weight loss and increased physical activity or control condition (diabetes support and education) that has fostered excellent retention. A proven protocol for standardized structural MRI will provide regional brain and ischemic lesion volumes; functional MRI will provide assessments of functional activation, resting state connectivity, and cerebral blood flow. A tested cognitive battery and physical activity assessment will be administered. A comprehensive analysis of these data will make use of established statistical approaches and novel machine-learning methods. Look AHEAD provides extensive 10-year characterizations of participant's health and behavior, their medical care and its cost, and the trial's interventions; state-of-the art data management systems; and provisions for developing public access databases. Our research team includes established and productive experts in brain imaging, diabetes research, behavioral medicine, data and image analysis, neuroepidemiology, and collaboration.

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level  ABSTRACT: This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification. Together, these studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of brain connectivity and brain activity in autism, and set the direction for my future career.  PROJECT NARRATIVE: These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism. This will be important information for guiding future diagnoses and intervention.",Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level,8681538,R00MH094409,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lobe', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Algorithm', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'theories', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R00,2014,232967,0.07469267146091838
"Growth factors, neuroinflammation, exercise, and brain integrity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The aging brain suffers from progressive brain tissue loss, putting hundreds of millions of us at risk for memory loss and dementia with no known cure. We recently discovered, in studies related to physical activity, growth factors, and homocysteine, several new leads about what may promote brain integrity. These variables interact with each other, with inflammation, and with brain structure and disease risk in complex and striking ways. To resist the looming epidemic of degenerative disease, we must determine how such variables deter brain decline. We will map, with unprecedented sensitivity, how these vital processes, which are targetable with interventions, relate to brain structure. We also combine brain measures to predict, with machine learning who will imminently decline. We relate brain and cognitive decline in 3 populations to (1) an inflammatory marker and related neurodegenerative risk genes, (2) growth factor and homocysteine levels, and (3) physical exercise. We will discover how these variables interact to promote or deter brain disease, in our regions of interest (ROIs) - the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex (PFC), and cingulate gyrus. This work is crucial to combat diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and schizophrenia (SZ), among others that are both related to these variables and marked by deficits in these ROIs. We will also survey the whole brain with novel brain mapping methods. Physical activity promotes human brain regeneration in these regions, in part through its effects on growth factors. It decreases inflammation and homocysteine levels, both of which relate to hippocampal integrity. Our project will boost power in clinical trials by identifying targetable disease-driving mechanisms. Building on our recent discoveries, we use (1) genotyped variants in inflammation-related genes, (2) a controllable ""environmental"" variable (exercise), and (3) peripheral measures related to inflammation, neurogenesis, and homocysteine to assess integrity of the hippocampus, PFC, and cingulate gyrus, and their progressive decline. We examine three populations already scanned with MRI: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (566 AD, MCI, and normal elderly subjects), the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS; 517 AD, MCI, and control subjects; of whom 85 have our targeted serum measures), and the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, composed of younger adults from families with autosomal dominant AD mutations (DIAN; ~400: ~20% with AD; ~50% mutation carriers). We will assess: 3/4 how candidate gene variants associated with AD and inflammation (see Approach) relate to a serum marker of inflammation (tumor necrosis factor alpha;TNFα), and to hippocampal volume. 3/4 how serum levels of growth factors and homocysteine relate to hippocampal, PFC, and cingulate volume. 3/4 how exercise levels affect hippocampal volume; how growth factors and TNFα modulate this relationship. 3/4 how baseline serum levels of growth factors, TNFα, and homocysteine, polymorphisms in related genes, and exercise together predict brain and cognitive changes over a 2-year follow-up period. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our project will have major impact on public health by discovering how three key processes (inflammation, brain growth factors, and exercise) relate to brain structure and brain decline over a 2-year period. Physical exercise boosts the ability of growth factors to promote regeneration in the hippocampus, which is important in memory; inflammation (which has many causes, including disease) decreases that ability. Our last 20 years of work revealed how Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, depression, and drug abuse involve hippocampal deficits and brain atrophy. Here we will evaluate in three large populations how growth factors, inflammation, and exercise work together to protect or harm the human brain - identifying promising directions for treatment, prevention, and a mechanistic understanding of diseases and disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction.","Growth factors, neuroinflammation, exercise, and brain integrity",8696676,RF1AG041915,"['Aerobic', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease risk', 'Amino Acids', 'Atrophic', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Mapping', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Degenerative Disorder', 'Dementia', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Elderly', 'Elements', 'Employee Strikes', 'Encephalitis', 'Epidemic', 'Exercise', 'Family', 'Gene Mutation', 'Genes', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genotype', 'Growth Factor', 'Growth Factor Gene', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Homocysteine', 'Homocystine', 'Horns', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'Infarction', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammation Process', 'Inflammatory', 'Inherited', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Link', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Memory Loss', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Natural regeneration', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Nerve Growth Factors', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Population Growth', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Serum', 'Serum Markers', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Symptoms', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'Width', 'Work', 'adult neurogenesis', 'aging brain', 'brain tissue', 'brain volume', 'brain-derived growth factor', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cingulate gyrus', 'cognitive change', 'cohort', 'combat', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'gray matter', 'hippocampal atrophy', 'immune function', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'interest', 'mental state', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'morphometry', 'mutation carrier', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurogenesis', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'neurotropic', 'novel', 'risk variant', 'trend', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,RF1,2014,2938975,-0.04115773931825279
"Methods for Dynamic Causal Interactions in Human Brain Function and Dysfunction     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function. Although fMRI research has primarily focused on identifying brain regions that are activated during performance of cognitive tasks, there is growing interest in examining how cognitive functions emerge as a result of context-dependent, dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. Devising and validating methods for investigating such interactions has therefore taken on great significance. The first major goal of this proposal is to address a critical need in fMRI research by developing novel algorithms for identifying context-dependent dynamic causal interactions between distributed brain regions. To this end, we will develop and validate novel computational methods using Multivariate Dynamical Systems based Markov chain Monte Carlo (MDS-MCMC) algorithms that overcome major limitations of existing methods for investigating dynamic causal interactions and connectivity in the human brain. A comprehensive validation framework will be use evaluate MDS-MCMC and compare it with existing dynamic causal estimation methods. The second major goal of this proposal is to use the MDS-MCMC framework to investigate dynamic causal interactions underlying cognition in normal healthy adults, and in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive impairment is one of the most devastating symptoms in PD. Once thought of as an insignificant feature of the disease, it is now clear that cognitive impairment is present in the majority of PD patients and that this impairment is significantly linked to increased disability and the risk of mortality, yetlittle is known about the brain basis of cognitive impairment in PD. The computational algorithms we develop, validate, and apply here will allow us to rigorously investigate brain dynamics support critical cognitive processes in the human brain, leading to a more complete understanding of fundamental mechanisms underlying human brain function and dysfunction. Our proposed studies will also, for the first time, examine casual interactions in simulated, open-source, opto-genetic, experimental and clinical brain imaging data using state-of-the-art sub-second high-temporal resolution fMRI, based on the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Critically, we will maintain a tight link between our computational and systems neuroscience goals algorithms to solve important problems in cognitive, systems and clinical neuroscience. Together, our proposed studies will lead to new and improved computational tools for examining dynamical causal interactions between distributed brain regions, with broad applications to the HCP and clinical neuroscience. The proposed studies are highly relevant to the mission of the NIH Innovations in Biomedical Computational Science and Technology and the Big Data to Knowledge Programs, which seek to encourage development and dissemination of innovative advanced computational tools for brain imaging and neuroscience. We will disseminate our algorithms and software to the research community via NITRC .         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In the past two decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has emerged as a powerful tool for investigating human brain function and dysfunction.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.        Program Director (Last, first, middle): Kleinfeld, David, Kaufhold, John and Squier, Jeffrey. These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain. We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments. The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine: One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.

"FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging studies of depression have suggested aberrant brain network relationships in this disorder. Despite these compelling findings there have been very few investigations examining the developmental timing of these alterations in children experiencing the earliest known form of depression, Preschool Depression (PD). The purpose of this mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the applicant with the skills and experience necessary to begin filling this knowledge gap. The unique mentorship and training opportunities available to the applicant complement his strong background in clinical psychology and research with clinical populations. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop an independent programmatic line of research investigating the developmental neurobiology of depression. To facilitate this goal, instruction and mentoring are proposed in 1) applying a systematic approach to the study of functional brain network development in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 2) methods for studying the relationships between brain networks and behavior in PD and 3) methods for studying the convergence between network organization and task based fMRI activity in PD. An expert interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants will support the proposed research and training plan. The feasibility of the proposed award is enhanced by the availability of a large set of fMRI data from an ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging study of school age children with a history of PD and their same age healthy peers (NIMH MH090786) as well as a high level of success in obtaining pilot fMRI data from healthy and depressed preschoolers (4-6 years old). Using these samples, a systematic approach investigating functional brain networks at the level of individual brain regions or region pairs, targeted subnetworks, and whole brain networks (using graph theory methods) is planned for aim 1. As a second aim, the behavioral correlates associated with group differences identified in aim 1 will be examined. Patterns of overlap between group differences in brain network organization and fMRI task-based activity during an emotion face-viewing paradigm (collected in the same individuals) will be the focus of a planned exploratory aim. It is hypothesized that 1) PD will be associated with disrupted Default Mode Network connectivity 2) atypical network organization will be related to depression severity and emotion regulation difficulties in PD and 3) a high level of overlap between network and task based group differences will be present. The study of brain networks in PD may reveal unique and early occurring neurobiological markers of risk for continued mood difficulties and/or later depression; information potentially critical for developing novel preventative treatments aimed at minimizing depression's public health burden. The complimentary training and research plans proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition into an independent researc career addressing NIMH research priorities that emphasize discoveries in the brain and behavioral sciences (Strategic Plan) and the study of brain networks in psychopathology (RDoC).!          The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder. Despite growing recognition of depression as a 'network illness', there have been very few studies examining functional brain network organization in children with very early occurring depression. Such studies could lead to the earlier identification of children who will later develop MDD and inform new preventive treatment efforts aimed at minimizing the significant burden of this important public health issue. Thus, the proposed award addresses important federal research priorities aimed at reducing the impact of depression on public health.

"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.                ",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8688242,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Geometry', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2014,602789,0.07119965167993628
"Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. With respect to the mission of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, more complete resection reduces the burden of neurological disease by restoring function, extending life, and improving the quality of that life. With respect to surgical therapy, the deployment of visual displays that relate the patient's exposed brain within the operating room (OR) to the pre- operatively acquired neuroanatomical images has become commonplace. More specifically, surgeons can use a pen-like stylus to point at a specific feature on the patient's brain tissue and see where that tissue resides on the neuroanatomical images as facilitated by an interactive display. One detriment to this process is when the patient's brain deforms due to common surgical manipulations. As a result, the alignment between images and the patient's physical brain becomes compromised and surgical error could ensue. Over years 1-7 of this award (initial submission & first renewal), we have demonstrated that intraoperatively acquired cortical surface geometric data can be used to: improve image-to-patient alignment, measure brain deformations during surgery, and drive a computational approach to brain shift correction during image-guided neurosurgery. In this application, we take the final step of extensive intraoperative validation and independent testing. The hypothesis to be tested is that computer models, cortical surface geometric data, and tracked stylus digitization technology when used to compensate for deformation during image-guided brain tumor surgery can predict the locations of eloquent brain surround pathology such that this approach is an effective surrogate to intraoperative magnetic resonance (iMR) imaging. The specific aims to accomplish this are to: (1) integrate a novel computer-vision based approach to surgical field digitization within the surgical microscope and commercial guidance environment such that acquired data can drive a computer model-based approach to correct displays for deformations, (2) conduct a 20 patient retrospective validation study with independent collaborator Dr. Alex Golby of Brigham and Women's hospital comparing the results from our cortical surface deformation driven compensation pipeline to that acquired by the ""gold standard"" iMR imaging approach, (3) conduct two prospective 20 patient studies at Vanderbilt and the Brigham respectively, and evaluate intraoperative workflow, as well as the efficacy of corrected displays at institutions wit and without the presence of the iMR alternative. With respect to the importance of this work, in large part, the use of image-guided surgery for surgical resection in soft-tissue organs has been confined primarily to the cranial environment with the common understanding that 'brain shift' is a problem. With the resolution of deformations by this low-cost minimally encumbered solution, the ability to translate image-guided surgery to other soft- tissue organs could become commonplace. Furthermore, the approaches herein are inexpensive when compared to intra-operative imaging methods (e.g. MR), and scalable, i.e. capable of widespread adoption. This application could be seminal in providing the needed surrogate for the wider populations of patient that could benefit from improved 'deformation corrected' guidance but may not have access to iMR facilities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: With respect to the presenting patient population, approximately 69,720 new cases of primary brain tumors are expected to be diagnosed in 2013 with approximately 35% of those tumors being malignant. Brain tumors are the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in children under age 20, and males between the ages of 20-30. Interestingly, incidence rates are significantly higher in developed countries, approximately 70% higher. The above translates to an estimated 23,170 new cases diagnosed this year with approximately 14,080 deaths. Five year survival rates following diagnosis of a primary brain tumor is approximately 33.8% on average but vary considerably with age (e.g. over the age of 65 is 10%). According to the National Cancer Institute surgical removal is the recommended treatment for most brain tumors with the goal of the most complete resection possible while preserving neurological function. More complete resection restores function, extends life, and improves the quality of that life. The goal of this project is to assist the surgeon in producing a more complete resection of brain tumors. The other important aspect is the technology we are introducing is relatively inexpensive and is amenable to widespread adoption by medical centers all across the country.            ",Multimodal Registration of the Brain's Cortical Surface,8720479,R01NS049251,"['Accounting', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Award', 'Brain', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Caring', 'Cephalic', 'Cessation of life', 'Child', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Country', 'Data', 'Developed Countries', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Excision', 'Financial compensation', 'Foundations', 'Functional Imaging', 'Funding', 'Geometry', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Imagery', 'Incidence', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Lasers', 'Life', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mainstreaming', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical center', 'Methods', 'Microscope', 'Mission', 'National Cancer Institute', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Nature', 'Nervous System Physiology', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Primary Brain Neoplasms', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Seminal', 'Site', 'Solutions', 'Surface', 'Surgeon', 'Surgical Error', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Wit', 'Woman', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'brain tumor resection', 'cost', 'functional restoration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'intraoperative imaging', 'male', 'nervous system disorder', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'patient population', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'soft tissue', 'sound', 'standard of care', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NINDS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,566111,0.010583675245658022
"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics. Algorithms that consider multiple genetic variants jointly, we propose, are likely to (1) more powerfully detect new gene effects on brain images, and (2) identify profiles of candidate genetic variants to assist prediction of an individual's brain integrity and risk for disease.       Neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability across the world. By developing new computerized models for the prediction of clinical outcomes based on disease-specific neuroimaging, biochemical and genetic biomarkers as well as the early prediction of white matter integrity based on genetic profiles, we hope to pave the way to personalized prevention and management of brain disorders.",Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning,8448904,F30AG041681,"['Accounting', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anisotropy', 'Back', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biochemical Markers', 'Biochemistry', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Computer Simulation', 'Data', 'Deterioration', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Electroencephalography', 'Emission-Computed Tomography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Programming', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Outcome', 'Outcome Measure', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Photons', 'Population', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Risk', 'Severities', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Staging', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision-making', 'clinically relevant', 'computerized', 'design', 'disability', 'disease diagnosis', 'disorder risk', 'endophenotype', 'gene discovery', 'gene interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'genome-wide', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'medical schools', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'prognostic', 'response', 'time interval', 'treatment response', 'white matter', 'working group']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F30,2013,47232,0.047778499275360424
"CRCNS: Hybrid non-invasive brain-machine interfaces for 3D object manipulation Interacting with the physical environment and manipulating objects is an essential part of daily life. This ability is lost in upper-limb amputees as well as patients with spinal cord injury, stroke, ALS and other movement disorders. These people know what they want to do as well as how they would do it if their arms were functional. If such knowledge is decoded and sent to a prosthetic arm (or to the patient's own arm fitted with functional electric stimulators) the lost motor function could be restored. The decoding is unlikely to be perfect however the brain can adapt to an imperfect decoder using real-time feedback. Several groups including ours have recently demonstrated that at least in principle this can be achieved. However, as is often the case in science, the initial work has been done in idealized conditions and its applicability to real-world usage scenarios remains an open question. The goal of this project is to bring movement control brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) closer to helping the people who need them, and at the same time exploit the rich datasets we collect in order to advance our understanding of sensorimotor control and learning. This will be accomplished by creating hybrid BMIs which exploit information from multiple sources, combined with modern algorithms from machine learning and automatic control. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Being able to interact with the physical environment and manipulate objects is an essential part of daily life.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.  This project examines whether signals recorded directly from the human brain (during surgery for epilepsy) could be used to control a robotic hand.

"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.          Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Action for Health in Diabetes Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ancillary Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preservation of brain health is a critical goal in the care of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who are at increased risk for atrophy, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. Weight loss and increased physical activity hold promise as potentially effective strategies for this purpose, but are currently unproven in any population. Because unintended weight loss often precedes declines in later life brain health, a randomized controlled clinical trial is necessary, which must feature an effective behavioral intervention that is sustained over a long period of time in a large well characterized cohort. Mounting such a program de novo would be very expensive. Instead, we propose to make use of the ongoing and very successful Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) randomized controlled clinical trial, adding cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to its extensive data collection protocol. This is feasible: participants in clinical trials have been repeatedly shown to be willing to join brain imaging studies and we have developed successful protocols for maintaining safety, confidentiality, and quality. This is novel: Look AHEAD and the state-of-the-art MRI protocols that we propose provide an unprecedented opportunity to assess the long-term effectiveness of mid-life behavioral changes on brain structure and function and to advance understanding of brain health in diabetes. We address an important public health priority for a rapidly growing and under-studied segment of the US population in a cost-effective manner, leveraging the extensive research resources available from Look AHEAD. We respond to PAR-09-247, which targets ancillary study applications to major NIDDK clinical trials, including Look AHEAD. We will enroll 496 participants, ages 55-85 years with type 2 diabetes, from 3 Look AHEAD clinics. They will have been randomly assigned 10 years ago when they were obese or overweight, with equal probability, to either an ongoing intensive lifestyle intervention that has induced sustained weight loss and increased physical activity or control condition (diabetes support and education) that has fostered excellent retention. A proven protocol for standardized structural MRI will provide regional brain and ischemic lesion volumes; functional MRI will provide assessments of functional activation, resting state connectivity, and cerebral blood flow. A tested cognitive battery and physical activity assessment will be administered. A comprehensive analysis of these data will make use of established statistical approaches and novel machine-learning methods.

"Action for Health in Diabetes Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ancillary Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preservation of brain health is a critical goal in the care of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who are at increased risk for atrophy, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. Weight loss and increased physical activity hold promise as potentially effective strategies for this purpose, but are currently unproven in any population. Because unintended weight loss often precedes declines in later life brain health, a randomized controlled clinical trial is necessary, which must feature an effective behavioral intervention that is sustained over a long period of time in a large well characterized cohort. Mounting such a program de novo would be very expensive. Instead, we propose to make use of the ongoing and very successful Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) randomized controlled clinical trial, adding cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to its extensive data collection protocol. This is feasible: participants in clinical trials have been repeatedly shown to be willing to join brain imaging studies and we have developed successful protocols for maintaining safety, confidentiality, and quality. This is novel: Look AHEAD and the state-of-the-art MRI protocols that we propose provide an unprecedented opportunity to assess the long-term effectiveness of mid-life behavioral changes on brain structure and function and to advance understanding of brain health in diabetes. We address an important public health priority for a rapidly growing and under-studied segment of the US population in a cost-effective manner, leveraging the extensive research resources available from Look AHEAD. We respond to PAR-09-247, which targets ancillary study applications to major NIDDK clinical trials, including Look AHEAD. We will enroll 496 participants, ages 55-85 years with type 2 diabetes, from 3 Look AHEAD clinics. They will have been randomly assigned 10 years ago when they were obese or overweight, with equal probability, to either an ongoing intensive lifestyle intervention that has induced sustained weight loss and increased physical activity or control condition (diabetes support and education) that has fostered excellent retention. A proven protocol for standardized structural MRI will provide regional brain and ischemic lesion volumes; functional MRI will provide assessments of functional activation, resting state connectivity, and cerebral blood flow. A tested cognitive battery and physical activity assessment will be administered. A comprehensive analysis of these data will make use of established statistical approaches and novel machine-learning methods.

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level  ABSTRACT: This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification. Together, these studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of brain connectivity and brain activity in autism, and set the direction for my future career.  PROJECT NARRATIVE: These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism. This will be important information for guiding future diagnoses and intervention.",Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level,8542895,R00MH094409,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Autistic Disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.)', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Functional Imaging', 'Future', 'Grant', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Learning', 'Lobe', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research Training', 'Rest', 'Scanning', 'Severities', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Training', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'blood oxygen level dependent', 'career', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'novel', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory cortex', 'social', 'theories', 'visual stimulus']",NIMH,INDIANA UNIVERSITY BLOOMINGTON,R00,2013,232307,0.07469267146091838
"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.  The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.

"Integrating Multimodal Brain Imaging Data to Assess Subtle Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional neuroimaging studies of the human brain have become increasingly important in the understanding of normal and pathological processes of cognition. Sophisticated statistical analytic frameworks have been developed to locate signal change and define brain networks involved in various tasks. However, in subtle cognitive impairment-e.g., exposure-related illness, early stages of degenerative diseases, injury, secondary illness following adjuvant therapy for cancer-these methods tend to have low sensitivity for detecting small changes in brain states resulting from mild brain dysfunction. An understanding of disease mechanism or progression of subtle cognitive dysfunction requires a novel statistical analytic framework with improved sensitivity to measure small changes in brain states. We have developed an innovative methodology that we successfully applied in measures of regional cerebral blood flow experiments. These methods use well established spatial modeling procedures, new to the functional brain imaging field, to derive statistically optimal spatial summaries within effective resolution groups or ""kriging"", shown by preliminary studies to improve signal detection sensitivity and mitigate the multiple testing burden. Within this new spatial modeling framework, we propose to extend the kriging methodology to fMRI and EEG, modify existing techniques for characterizing brain networks of connectivity (e.g., kriging-based independent components analysis), and integrate the imaging modalities using a statistical classifier based on derived inputs of data driven effective resolution groups. Our primary goal is to develop this analysis framework to provide insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of mild cognitive dysfunction. Achieving this goal may suggest treatments to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, or at minimum, provide an informed clinical management of cognitively impaired patients.        Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages. Causes range from traumatic injury to toxin exposures, including chemotherapy for cancer treatment, to degenerative diseases. Mechanisms of damage or disease remain difficult to establish using current methods in functional brain imaging studies due to an inability to measure very small changes in brain states. We propose a new analytic framework using existing technology to improve the ability to measure subtle changes important in the understanding of disease pathology of impaired cognition and to greatly facilitate the integration of information from several imaging modalities with potential implications for clinical management and treatment.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.

"FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging studies of depression have suggested aberrant brain network relationships in this disorder. Despite these compelling findings there have been very few investigations examining the developmental timing of these alterations in children experiencing the earliest known form of depression, Preschool Depression (PD). The purpose of this mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the applicant with the skills and experience necessary to begin filling this knowledge gap. The unique mentorship and training opportunities available to the applicant complement his strong background in clinical psychology and research with clinical populations. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop an independent programmatic line of research investigating the developmental neurobiology of depression. To facilitate this goal, instruction and mentoring are proposed in 1) applying a systematic approach to the study of functional brain network development in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 2) methods for studying the relationships between brain networks and behavior in PD and 3) methods for studying the convergence between network organization and task based fMRI activity in PD. An expert interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants will support the proposed research and training plan. The feasibility of the proposed award is enhanced by the availability of a large set of fMRI data from an ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging study of school age children with a history of PD and their same age healthy peers (NIMH MH090786) as well as a high level of success in obtaining pilot fMRI data from healthy and depressed preschoolers (4-6 years old). Using these samples, a systematic approach investigating functional brain networks at the level of individual brain regions or region pairs, targeted subnetworks, and whole brain networks (using graph theory methods) is planned for aim 1. As a second aim, the behavioral correlates associated with group differences identified in aim 1 will be examined. Patterns of overlap between group differences in brain network organization and fMRI task-based activity during an emotion face-viewing paradigm (collected in the same individuals) will be the focus of a planned exploratory aim. It is hypothesized that 1) PD will be associated with disrupted Default Mode Network connectivity 2) atypical network organization will be related to depression severity and emotion regulation difficulties in PD and 3) a high level of overlap between network and task based group differences will be present. The study of brain networks in PD may reveal unique and early occurring neurobiological markers of risk for continued mood difficulties and/or later depression; information potentially critical for developing novel preventative treatments aimed at minimizing depression's public health burden. The complimentary training and research plans proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition into an independent researc career addressing NIMH research priorities that emphasize discoveries in the brain and behavioral sciences (Strategic Plan) and the study of brain networks in psychopathology (RDoC).!          The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder. Despite growing recognition of depression as a 'network illness', there have been very few studies examining functional brain network organization in children with very early occurring depression. Such studies could lead to the earlier identification of children who will later develop MDD and inform new preventive treatment efforts aimed at minimizing the significant burden of this important public health issue. Thus, the proposed award addresses important federal research priorities aimed at reducing the impact of depression on public health.

"Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Accurate mapping of normal and abnormal patterns of brain development in fetuses and premature neonates is a key factor in the early detection of developmental disorders as well as understanding how external factors can influence early brain growth. The combination of fast multi-slice MRI techniques with computer vision algorithms has recently provided the ability to reliably image 3D brain structure in-utero providing valuable information inaccessible to ultrasound imaging. To complement this new structural information, recently there has been increasing interest in the use of functional MR imaging (fMRI) to map the development of resting state brain function in children, premature neonates and, most recently, fetuses in-utero. This work has revealed signs of a predictable developmental path in the formation of resting state patterns of brain activity present in adults and abnormalities in these patterns in children have been linked with neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions in later life. Such fMRI methods, previously used in adults and children, could provide a unique new window into functional activity in the developing fetal brain. However, the imaging techniques required suffer from an important limitation for use in the fetus: they make use of repeated acquisitions where subtle changes in MR signal provide the measure of interest. Fetal head motion within the scanner perturbs both measurement location and signal level due to the changing relationship between fetal anatomy, maternal anatomy and the scanner. Based on our preliminary results, in this proposal we plan to develop a set of new signal and geometry correction methods specifically for fetal fMRI that combine novel acquisition techniques with post-processing algorithms to provide a new route to addressing these unique problems. This will allow us to collect the first accurate functional MRI data from a range of un-sedated fetuses in ages and activity levels seen in clinical studies. We will develop and validate these methods together with complementary pattern analysis techniques specifically aimed at motion scattered data and employ them to build the first combined 4D structure-function map of brain development in-utero. This will show for the first time the temporal and spatial relationship between structural changes and the development of resting state patterns of brain activity covering the critical age of first clinical MRI scan and the following period of cortical folding. his will help answer such questions as: which tissue zones of the fetal brain such activity begins, and whether the functional patterns are related to the timing of the formation of specific cortical folds. We will collect a range of data that captures fetuses both at different ages and different states of activity representing those seen in typical clinical studies, and in addition collect valuable outcome measures on the babies after birth against which in-utero measure will be evaluated. We release the data to the community as a whole in the form of an open-access 4D atlas. This combined structure-function data will provide a unique new reference for both neuroscience and, in the longer term, clinical evaluation of brain health during pregnancy and premature birth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Clinically, improved in-utero evaluation of the fetal brain is a key concern for obstetricians and pediatricians in managing complex pregnancies and there is also now an increasing public health awareness of the influence of the in-utero environment, in terms of factors such as stress and diet, on long-term health in adult life. Functional connectivit imaging of the brain in childhood has revealed the presence of early markers of later cognitive and neuropsychological problems. The ability to map these same properties in utero, promises to provide a rich set of very specific early markers that can be used to understand the impact of the in-utero environment on brain function and feasibly provide a route to the use of early neuro-protective agents and procedures early in childhood.                ",Motion Robust Mapping of Human Brain Functional Connectivity Changes in Utero,8509448,R01EB017133,"['Accounting', 'Acoustic Stimulation', 'Acoustics', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Awareness', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependency', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diet', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Echo-Planar Imaging', 'Elderly', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Fetal Heart Rate', 'Fetal Movement', 'Fetus', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gestational Age', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Head', 'Health', 'Heart Rate', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Left', 'Life', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Midbrain structure', 'Monitor', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neonatal', 'Network-based', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome Measure', 'Pattern', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predisposition', 'Pregnancy', 'Premature Birth', 'Prematurity of fetus', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protective Agents', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Route', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slice', 'Source', 'Staging', 'Stimulus', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'design', 'developmental disease', 'experience', 'fetal', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'interest', 'neonate', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'pediatrician', 'population based', 'premature', 'public health relevance', 'research clinical testing', 'spatial relationship', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2013,650062,0.07119965167993628
"CRCNS: Hybrid non-invasive brain-machine interfaces for 3D object manipulation Interacting with the physical environment and manipulating objects is an essential part of daily life. This ability is lost in upper-limb amputees as well as patients with spinal cord injury, stroke, ALS and other movement disorders. These people know what they want to do as well as how they would do it if their arms were functional. If such knowledge is decoded and sent to a prosthetic arm (or to the patient's own arm fitted with functional electric stimulators) the lost motor function could be restored. The decoding is unlikely to be perfect however the brain can adapt to an imperfect decoder using real-time feedback. Several groups including ours have recently demonstrated that at least in principle this can be achieved. However, as is often the case in science, the initial work has been done in idealized conditions and its applicability to real-world usage scenarios remains an open question. The goal of this project is to bring movement control brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) closer to helping the people who need them, and at the same time exploit the rich datasets we collect in order to advance our understanding of sensorimotor control and learning. This will be accomplished by creating hybrid BMIs which exploit information from multiple sources, combined with modern algorithms from machine learning and automatic control. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Being able to interact with the physical environment and manipulate objects is an essential part of daily life. Brain-machine interfaces are one way to restore this ability to patients who have lost it.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.  This project examines whether signals recorded directly from the human brain (during surgery for epilepsy) could be used to control a robotic hand.

"Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Development and Dissemination of Robust Brain MRI Measurement Tools Abstract: Summary. Neuroimaging provides a safe, non-invasive measurement of the whole brain, and has enabled large clinical and research studies for brain development, aging, and disorders. However, many disorders, i.e., major neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, cause complex spatiotemporal patterns of brain alteration, which are often difficult to identify visually and compare over time. To address this critical issu, in the renewal phase of this project, we will continue to work with GE Research to develop and disseminate a software package for brain measurement, comparison, and diagnosis. The new tools include 1) a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases-based segmentation method for precise measurement of brain alteration patterns, and 2) novel pattern classification and regression methods for early detection and longitudinal monitoring of brain disorders. Aims. Currently, most existing atlas-based labeling methods simply warp each atlas independently to the individual brain for multi-atlases-based structural labeling. This could lead to 1) inaccurate labeling due to possible large registration error when the atlases are very different from the target individual brain, and 2) inconsistent labeling of the same brain structure across different individuals due to independent labeling of each individual brain. The first goal of this project is hence to develop a novel tree-based registration and multi-atlases -based segmentation method for simultaneous registration and joint labeling of all individual brains by concurrent consideration of all atlases. With measurements of brain structures and their alteration patterns, univariate analysis methods are often used to understand how the disease affects brain structure and function at a group level. Although this can lead to better understanding of neurological pathology of brain disorders, more sophisticated image analysis methods are urgently needed for quantitative assessment and early diagnosis of brain abnormality at an individual level. Thus, the second goal of this project is to develop various novel machine learning methods for early diagnosis of brain disorders and better quantification of brain abnormality at an individual level. Specifically, we will take Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common form of dementia, as an example for demonstrating the performance of our proposed methods in early diagnosis of AD, as well as in prediction of long-term outcomes of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The last goal of this project is to build, for ou developed methods, the respective software modules for the 3D Slicer (a free open-source software package with a flexible modular platform for medical image analysis and visualization, http://www.slicer.org/), to promote the potential clinical applications by using tools in 3D Slicer for preprocessing of patient data and our tools for diagnosis. Again, this software development work will be performed in collaboration with our current collaborator, GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC) that is focused on developing 3D Slicer. Both source code and pre-compiled programs will be made freely available. Applications. These methods can find their applications in diverse fields, i.e., quantifying brain abnormality of neurological diseases (i.e., AD and schizophrenia), measuring effects of different pharmacological interventions on the brain, and finding associations between structural and cognitive function variables.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Description of Project This project aims to develop a novel method for accurate measurement of brain structure and function by groupwise registration and joint labeling of all individual images via multiple manual-labeled atlases. Moreover, several novel tools for brain abnormality measurement will also be developed for early detection and progression monitoring of brain disorders using both multimodal imaging and non-imaging data. By successful development of these brain measurement tools, the respective software modules will be developed and further incorporated into 3D Slicer via collaboration with GE Research, which is a part of the engineering core of the National Alliance for Medical Image Computing (NA-MIC).

"Functional MRI Method Development The Section on Functional Imaging Methods (SFIM) continues to develop cutting edge methods at the interface of functional MRI (fMRI) technology, image processing, interpretation of the signal, and neuroscience applications. The goal of SFIM is to fill the much-needed gap of improving fMRI from both a methodological and usability standpoint. We aim to increase the depth and breath of fMRI applications and bridge the gap to clinical applications on individual patients. This report describes progress in our research. In the past year, we have published 16 papers, making this one of our most prolific years.   Feature Selection and classification accuracy.  Carried out by my post doc Carlton Chu. A growing area in fMRI is the use of Machine Learning algorithms to characterize fMRI patterns of activity as they are associated with specific tasks. A central problem in this approach is regarding how to chose ahead of time, the appropriate region on which to perform these calculations. Many classification approaches simply use all voxels in the entire brain. While this works, it includes many voxels that are not involved with the task itself. This paper addresses this issue and determines that, in fact, feature selection is better, yet depends a bit on the algorithm being used.   Multi-echo acquisition and Independent Component Sorting Carried out by my graduate student Prantik Kundu as well as E. Bullmore, N. Brenowitz, J. W. Evans, S. J. Inati, W.-M. Luh, V. Roopchansingh, Z. S. Saad. An ongoing challenge has been to remove the large fraction of non-neuronal fluctuations rom rs-fMRI time series. Work on characterizing and removing non-neuronal fluctuations has focused on time series modeling based on external measures of physiologic processes. In this study, we use the TE-dependence to separate BOLD from non-BOLD time signal. BOLD signal changes are manifest as changes in T2*, which can be characterized as showing a linear increase in fractional signal change with echo time (TE). Motion, system instabilities, and inflow effects can be manifest as changes in longitudinal relaxation, T1 or proton density, S0 but not typically T2*.   Muti-echo for removal of systematic motion effects in group comparisons Carried out by my graduate student Prantik Kundu. It has been shown that in-scanner subject head motion leads to systematic patterns of false positives in population-level rs-fMRI analysis. This artifact is worst for group contrasts of cohorts with different levels of in-scanner motion, and is a potential roadblock to further resting state fMRI - based research. Here we show that me-ICA enables elimination the problem of spurious functional connectivity (FC) patterns caused by motion and other artifacts. After decomposing multi-echo data with ICA and separating BOLD from non-BOLD components based on echo-time (TE) dependence, the BOLD-based ICA components are used to compute FC.  Computing an individual-subject me-ICA functional connectivity map for a region of interest (ROI) involves computing the correlation of its ICA series with the ICA component series of all other voxels. In contrast, the typical approach to computing FC maps involves motion regression, band pass filtering, and then Pearson correlation.  The me-ICA seed-based FC approach was compared to standard seed-based FC approach at the population level. Thirty-three subjects were scanned for 10 minutes EPI during rest (Siemens 3T Tim Trio, 32-channel). No increase in me-ICA FC false positive rate is found as groupings are increasingly biased according to motion.  We conclude that me-ICA FC is a principled and straightforward solution to the problem of spurious FC due to motion artifact.  Clustering of resting state correlations. Carried out by Prantik Kundu. A major goal in rs-fMRI is the whole-brain mapping of functional cortical networks down to the scale of voxels from a single dataset. Promising results have been obtained on highly subject-averaged data, however, our ultimate goal is to use the characteristics of these networks as individual biomarkers. Towards this goal, we have developed an approach, based on our me-ICA method that converges on stable and consistent areas with very few averages. The maps that we produce can also predict subject-specific activation patterns associated with activation-based paradigms.  This novel implementation of hierarchical clustering was able to create a community structure of brain organization, showing how large modules at low levels of clustering are related to smaller modules at high levels of clustering. We found that the 30-50 BOLD components from individual subject high dimensional me-ICA have localization to specific, finely delineated functional areas. The ability to consistently identify functional areas without functional localization tasks could also be of value as a biomarker for individual differences or disorder characterization.  Determining most and least stable cortical networks using resting state fMRI Carried out by my post doc Javier Gonzalez-Castillo. An assumption has been that connectivity patterns are stable for the duration of the scan. The purpose of this work is to characterize the temporal variation of resting state connectivity within a continuous 1 hour resting state scan. From this we are able to determine the most and least stable networks. We compared pairs of matrices that were created by averaging the signal over varying amounts of time ranging from 2 to 30 minutes. The correlations begin to show decreasing similarity below 10 minutes, and continue to drop sharply down to 2 minutes.  We used a sliding window correlation analysis with a window duration of 1 min and a window step of 1 s. We then sorted the pairwise connections from most to least variable. While some connections remain quite stable across time, others seem to vary considerably. It can be observed that stable connections tend to by inter-hemispheric and symmetric. The unstable connectivity patterns correspond to these between subcortical regions and high order cognitive regions in frontal and predominantly left parietal cortex.    Decoding ""yes"" from ""no"" answers. Carried out by Z. Yang. Towards the goal of determining the limits of sensitivity of the fMRI decoding approach, our goal was to determine of we could differentiate a simple yes or no response or subjective correctness, based on subjects fMRI activation patterns as they responded to simple common-knowledge questions. In each trial, we present a cue to instruct the subject to either honestly or dishonestly answer the following questions. After reading the questions, subjects have to keep their final answers in mind until a button-press prompt appears several seconds after the question are removed from the screen.  Looking at the BA9 portion of the left middle frontal gyrus. We extracted five time points of the voxels within this region, starting at the onset of the questions. Treating each voxel as a feature and each time point as a sample, we trained Gaussian Nave Bayesian (GNB) classifiers to predict the truthful Yes/No answers to the questions. The mean prediction accuracy achieved 90% when we averaged all 20 trials. These findings indicate that the truthful answers are encoded in brain activity independently from intentions, and multivariate pattern analysis is able to decode them from fMRI signal. n/a",Functional MRI Method Development,8556929,ZIAMH002783,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Calibration', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Drops', 'Excision', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Grouping', 'Hour', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Left', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Middle frontal gyrus structure', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motion', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Paper', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Perfusion', 'Physiological Processes', 'Population', 'Postdoctoral Fellow', 'Process', 'Protons', 'Publishing', 'Reading', 'Relaxation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Solutions', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Structure', 'Subject Headings', 'System', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Yang', 'abstracting', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comparison group', 'density', 'design', 'graduate student', 'image processing', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'method development', 'novel', 'response', 'time use', 'usability']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,ZIA,2012,1508161,0.00545916459957412
"Action for Health in Diabetes Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ancillary Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preservation of brain health is a critical goal in the care of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who are at increased risk for atrophy, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. Weight loss and increased physical activity hold promise as potentially effective strategies for this purpose, but are currently unproven in any population. Because unintended weight loss often precedes declines in later life brain health, a randomized controlled clinical trial is necessary, which must feature an effective behavioral intervention that is sustained over a long period of time in a large well characterized cohort. Mounting such a program de novo would be very expensive. Instead, we propose to make use of the ongoing and very successful Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) randomized controlled clinical trial, adding cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to its extensive data collection protocol. This is feasible: participants in clinical trials have been repeatedly shown to be willing to join brain imaging studies and we have developed successful protocols for maintaining safety, confidentiality, and quality. This is novel: Look AHEAD and the state-of-the-art MRI protocols that we propose provide an unprecedented opportunity to assess the long-term effectiveness of mid-life behavioral changes on brain structure and function and to advance understanding of brain health in diabetes.

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.  The second is an understanding of the normal patterns of blood flow throughout the brain, which provide the basis for interpreting medical images of brain function.

"Integrating Multimodal Brain Imaging Data to Assess Subtle Cognitive Impairment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Functional neuroimaging studies of the human brain have become increasingly important in the understanding of normal and pathological processes of cognition. Sophisticated statistical analytic frameworks have been developed to locate signal change and define brain networks involved in various tasks. However, in subtle cognitive impairment-e.g., exposure-related illness, early stages of degenerative diseases, injury, secondary illness following adjuvant therapy for cancer-these methods tend to have low sensitivity for detecting small changes in brain states resulting from mild brain dysfunction. An understanding of disease mechanism or progression of subtle cognitive dysfunction requires a novel statistical analytic framework with improved sensitivity to measure small changes in brain states. We have developed an innovative methodology that we successfully applied in measures of regional cerebral blood flow experiments. These methods use well established spatial modeling procedures, new to the functional brain imaging field, to derive statistically optimal spatial summaries within effective resolution groups or ""kriging"", shown by preliminary studies to improve signal detection sensitivity and mitigate the multiple testing burden. Within this new spatial modeling framework, we propose to extend the kriging methodology to fMRI and EEG, modify existing techniques for characterizing brain networks of connectivity (e.g., kriging-based independent components analysis), and integrate the imaging modalities using a statistical classifier based on derived inputs of data driven effective resolution groups. Our primary goal is to develop this analysis framework to provide insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of mild cognitive dysfunction. Achieving this goal may suggest treatments to alleviate symptoms, prevent progression, or at minimum, provide an informed clinical management of cognitively impaired patients.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages. Causes range from traumatic injury to toxin exposures, including chemotherapy for cancer treatment, to degenerative diseases. Mechanisms of damage or disease remain difficult to establish using current methods in functional brain imaging studies due to an inability to measure very small changes in brain states. We propose a new analytic framework using existing technology to improve the ability to measure subtle changes important in the understanding of disease pathology of impaired cognition and to greatly facilitate the integration of information from several imaging modalities with potential implications for clinical management and treatment.              Cognitive impairment is a major health concern, affecting people of all ages.

"FUNCTIONAL BRAIN NETWORK DEVELOPMENT IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEPRESSION     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neuroimaging studies of depression have suggested aberrant brain network relationships in this disorder. Despite these compelling findings there have been very few investigations examining the developmental timing of these alterations in children experiencing the earliest known form of depression, Preschool Depression (PD). The purpose of this mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23) is to provide the applicant with the skills and experience necessary to begin filling this knowledge gap. The unique mentorship and training opportunities available to the applicant complement his strong background in clinical psychology and research with clinical populations. The applicant's long-term goal is to develop an independent programmatic line of research investigating the developmental neurobiology of depression. To facilitate this goal, instruction and mentoring are proposed in 1) applying a systematic approach to the study of functional brain network development in PD using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 2) methods for studying the relationships between brain networks and behavior in PD and 3) methods for studying the convergence between network organization and task based fMRI activity in PD. An expert interdisciplinary team of mentors and consultants will support the proposed research and training plan. The feasibility of the proposed award is enhanced by the availability of a large set of fMRI data from an ongoing longitudinal neuroimaging study of school age children with a history of PD and their same age healthy peers (NIMH MH090786) as well as a high level of success in obtaining pilot fMRI data from healthy and depressed preschoolers (4-6 years old). Using these samples, a systematic approach investigating functional brain networks at the level of individual brain regions or region pairs, targeted subnetworks, and whole brain networks (using graph theory methods) is planned for aim 1. As a second aim, the behavioral correlates associated with group differences identified in aim 1 will be examined. Patterns of overlap between group differences in brain network organization and fMRI task-based activity during an emotion face-viewing paradigm (collected in the same individuals) will be the focus of a planned exploratory aim. It is hypothesized that 1) PD will be associated with disrupted Default Mode Network connectivity 2) atypical network organization will be related to depression severity and emotion regulation difficulties in PD and 3) a high level of overlap between network and task based group differences will be present. The study of brain networks in PD may reveal unique and early occurring neurobiological markers of risk for continued mood difficulties and/or later depression; information potentially critical for developing novel preventative treatments aimed at minimizing depression's public health burden. The complimentary training and research plans proposed in this application will facilitate the applicant's transition into an independent researc career addressing NIMH research priorities that emphasize discoveries in the brain and behavioral sciences (Strategic Plan) and the study of brain networks in psychopathology (RDoC).!        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder. Despite growing recognition of depression as a 'network illness', there have been very few studies examining functional brain network organization in children with very early occurring depression. Such studies could lead to the earlier identification of children who will later develop MDD and inform new preventive treatment efforts aimed at minimizing the significant burden of this important public health issue. Thus, the proposed award addresses important federal research priorities aimed at reducing the impact of depression on public health.                  The training and research goals outlined in the current application will enable the candidate to become an independent researcher in the field of translational developmental neuroscience, with unique expertise that could significantly increase our developmental understanding of brain networks in depression and how they go awry in this impairing disorder.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.

"Assessment of Gene Effects on the Brain and Disease Risk through Machine Learning    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Several neuroimaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are becoming increasingly important for diagnostic classification, prognostic evaluation and tracking treatment response in patients with brain disorders. They provide detailed, quantitative information about brain structure and function, and aspects of ongoing disease processes. Measures derived from these neuroimaging modalities have been studied through automated algorithms as potential predictors of disease outcomes. This proposal aims to introduce and evaluate new computerized algorithms, based on the field of machine learning that would incorporate not only brain imaging measures, but also biochemical and genetic information to create more powerful predictions of diagnostic and prognostic outcomes. Such novel, automated, multimodal predictors, we propose, may have important applications in future clinical decision making and clinical trial design. Brain imaging offers new quantitative measures that may be closer than cognitive assessments to the underlying biological mechanisms that lead to disease. By studying the associations of genetic factors with phenotypes based on cutting edge imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), we plan to examine mechanistically meaningful genetic contributions to brain disorders. The rapidly expanding field of neuroimaging genetics will provide the nexus for the applicant's intensive training in the world-class imaging and genetics programs at the UCLA School of Medicine. This proposal will introduce new automated algorithms for gene discovery and risk prediction into the field of neuroimaging genetics.

"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology. On its successful completion, based on specific milestones, we will move to the more applied work with human subjects.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. We are interested specifically in states and markers of impulsivity and cigarette craving. Our goal ultimately is to have a tool that can be used in the context of neurofeedback, allowing human subject or patient to receive an indication of activity in their brains associated with these states and to enable them to learn to control these cognitive/affective states by controlling the brain activity.           Project Narrative Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.

"Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and related electroencephalography (EEG) use an array of sensors to non-invasively measure electromagnetic (EM) fields produced by synchronous current activity within the brain. While the temporal resolution is excellent relative to other functional imaging modalities, accurately localizing in 3D space the sources of brain activity involves solving a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. Existing localization methods used clinically and for research purposes maintain significant shortcomings, including the inability to resolve complex source configurations, bias caused by source correlations, and sensitivity to sources of noise and interference. The latter can arise from eye blinks, heart beats, sensor imperfections, and industrial noise as well as from spontaneous background brain activity not associated with the brain sources of interest. Additionally, prototype algorithms ostensibly designed to deal with some of these issues are heuristic in nature and have not been rigorously evaluated or compared, making their ultimate utility difficult to assess for neuroelectromagnetic imaging practitioners. The proposed research plan addresses all of these concerns by developing a principled localization scheme that unifies and extends existing localization strategies using modern concepts from Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Based on the notion of automatic relevance determination (ARD), brain regions with probable (relevant) activity are located with high spatial resolution. Interference sources are effectively removed by integrating with a variation factor analysis model. To quantify the improvement afforded by the proposed methodology, source location estimates will be compared with standard algorithms using realistic simulations, near-ground-truth data obtained from invasive electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings, and surgical data. The result will be implemented as a user-friendly localization toolbox and made freely available to the community by integrating with existing open-source functional brain imaging software. Non-invasive mapping of brain activity with high spatio-temporal resolution has important consequences for basic neuroscience studies of human cognition. It also has profound implications for the diagnosis, characterization and treatment of various neurological, neurooncological, mental health, developmental, and communication disorders. For example, localizations of brain sources are used to map cognitive function in epileptogenic areas and in neighboring brain regions. Such brain mapping procedures are then useful to guide neurosurgical planning, navigation, and resection and to minimize post-operative deficits.           n/a",Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones,7942859,F32NS061395,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Benchmarking', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic pedigree', 'heuristics', 'human CYP2B6 protein', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'operation', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2011,19755,0.020468927468584867
"Functional MRI Method Development The Section on Functional Imaging Methods (SFIM) continues to develop cutting edge methods at the interface of functional MRI (fMRI) technology, image processing, interpretation of the signal, and neuroscience applications. The goal of SFIM is to fill the much-needed gap of improving fMRI from both a methodological and usability standpoint. We aim to increase the depth and breath of fMRI applications and effectively bridge the gap to clinical applications on individual patients. This report describes progress in our research. Flip Angle Selection effects on physiologic noise and BOLD sensitivity. Carried out by Javier Gonzalez-Castillo and Jerzy Bodurka.  We investigate, both how the temporal signal to noise (TSNR) dependence on flip angle. Our results suggest that when physiological noise dominates, there is a wide range of angles below the Ernst angle for which TSNR suffers a negligible decrease from its maximum value. Imaging at an angle below the Ernst angle is recommended as it comes accompanied by important practical benefits such as: higher specificity of fMRI; better tissue contrast; lower susceptibility to through-plane motion; and reduced levels of heat deposition in tissue. Averaging of task-based data reveals significant activations across the whole brain. Carried out by Javier Gonzalez-Castillo collaborating with Ziad Saad and Daniel Handwerker. In this work we show that the fMRI time series has much more non-canonical information than previously thought. Using a fMRI dataset composed of 100 functional runs in each of three subjects we have shown that significant task time-locked responses of very diverse shapes (e.g., positive sustained responses, negative sustained responses, stimulus onset/offset responses) can be recorded in the majority of the brain when TSNR is sufficiently high. This work suggests that the sparseness of activations in fMRI maps result from insufficient TSNR and/or overly strict model reference functions. Moreover, we have also demonstrated that inter-regional differences in response shape can be exploited to obtain functional parcellations of the whole brain in action (e.g., while subjects are involved in a task) in a manner similar to results from resting state analysis. Resulting parcellations from task-based data were symmetrical across hemispheres, reproducible across subjects, and anatomically and functionally meaningful. This is potentially breakthrough work in that it suggests that the entire brain is activated in some manner by every task.  Effect of tissue contrast on functional MRI Image Registration Carried out by Javier Gonzalez Castillo in collaboration with Kristen Duthie and Wen Ming Luh. Typical fMRI scans have parameters that create a flat image contrast in the time series images.  This along with inhomogeneous signal from multi-channel coils can degrade the output of registration algorithms; and consequently degrade group analysis and any attempt to accurately localize brain function. Non-invasive ways to improve tissue contrast in fMRI images include the use of low flip angles (FAs) well below the Ernst angle and longer repetition times (TR). In this work, we use a combination of real data and simulations to show that the use of low FAs (e.g., &#952;&#8804;40) significantly improves accuracy and consistency of registration for data acquired at relatively short TRs (TR&#8804;2s). Moreover, we also show that the application of bias correction techniques significantly improves alignment both for array-coil data (known to contain high intensity inhomogeneity) as well as birdcage-coil data.  What makes different resting state networks different.  Carried out by Javier Gonzalez-Castillo in collaboration with Meghan Robinson. Both data-driven (e.g., ICA) and hypothesis driven (e.g., seed-based analysis) analyses produce networks that are reproducible; still little is known about the underlying temporal and spectral characteristics that makes these networks unique and so reliable. So far, we have found no repeatable temporally distinguishing characteristics of these networks other than that the regions fluctuate together.  Multi-modal characterization of the effects of physical activity and motor learning on brain structure and function  Carried out by Adam Thomas while collaborating as a student with Heidi Johansen-Berg at the University of Oxford. Little is known regarding the processes by which the brain remodels the different components of its architecture with learning. Recent advances offer the opportunity to measure many different aspects of brain structure and function. The aim of this project is to characterize the different types of brain plasticity that occur under different experimental paradigms, such as aerobic exercise and motor learning, using a wide range of human neuroimaging techniques including quantitative mapping of magnetic susceptibility, myelination, and cerebral blood volume so that exactly what is changing is better understood.  Applying machine learning methods to derive new measures of functional connectivity Carried out primarily by Carlton Chu, the project tries to develop a novel approach to estimate the consistency of global functional connectivity. The approach described in this paper is a combination of brain decoding and analysis of functional connectivity. We apply kernel regression methods to predict the fMRI BOLD signal of one voxel using the activation pattern of other brain regions. The new metric is based on predictive validity, which measures the robustness of the connectivity pattern. The paper, which titled Measuring the Consistency of Global Functional Connectivity using Kernel Regression Methods, was published in IEEE International Workshop on Pattern Recognition in NeuroImaging on December 2010.  High-temporal resolution decoding of ocular dominant responses from the BOLD signal. Carried out by Masaya Misaki. The multi-voxel pattern analysis was utilized to decode a subtle timing difference of neural activations in the ocular dominance columns. By extracting response amplitude at variable peak time for each voxel and for each stimulus condition, the multivariate classification analysis could discriminate 100 ms onset time differences of neural activations in the ocular dominance columns. This result indicates that the BOLD signal has high-temporal and high-spatial resolution information in its multi-voxel response pattern.  Cleaning up fMRI time series by multi-echo acquisition Carried out by Prantik Kundu and Souheil Inati. This approach which uses multi-echo acquisition to separate BOLD from non-BOLD signal has proven to be a highly effective method for cleanly removing, in an automated manner, artifactual ICA components and for denoising resting state fMRI time series.  The functional role of the theta rhythm in hippocampal dependent memory Carried out by Raphael Kaplan with co-mentor Neil Burgess. The hippocampus is crucial for episodic or declarative memory and the theta rhythm has been implicated in mnemonic processing, but the functional contribution of theta to memory remains the subject of intense speculation. Recent evidence suggests that the human hippocampus might function as a network hub for volitional learning. Notably, hippocampal theta in behaving rodents reflects volitional movement, which has been linked to spatial exploration and memory encoding. To test the relationship between volitonal learning and volitional movement driven theta oscilations, we used a virtual spatial  navigation task in humans using  both MEG and fMRI respectively. In our tasks we found hippocampal volitional learning network activity and theta oscillations corresponding to both movement initiation and subsequent memory peformance. n/a",Functional MRI Method Development,8342127,ZIAMH002783,"['20 year old', 'Aerobic Exercise', 'Algorithms', 'Architecture', 'Blood Volume', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiac', 'Cerebrum', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Educational workshop', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Heating', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'International', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetism', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Movement', 'Nature', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Ocular dominance columns', 'Output', 'Paper', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Physical activity', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Process', 'Publishing', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Respiration', 'Response to stimulus physiology', 'Rest', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Running', 'Scanning', 'Seeds', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Theta Rhythm', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'blood oxygenation level dependent response', 'brain remodeling', 'clinical application', 'clinically relevant', 'image processing', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'interest', 'memory encoding', 'method development', 'motor learning', 'myelination', 'neglect', 'neuroimaging', 'novel strategies', 'regional difference', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'simulation', 'usability', 'virtual', 'way finding']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,ZIA,2011,1559908,0.024434861700258537

"Investigating Brain Connectivity in Autism at the Whole-Brain Level    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to elucidate the functional organization of the whole brain in Autism Spectrum Disorders (hereafter referred to as autism), a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that affect roughly 1 in 110 individuals born today. I will test the overarching hypothesis that functional coupling between different regions of the brain in autism is generally reduced. Moreover, I will explore the prediction that such reduced connectivity is associated with abnormal behavior. While anatomical and functional evidence support reduced brain connectivity in autism, this has never been tested at the whole-brain level. In this application, I propose to acquire resting-state and stimulus-evoked Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) activity across the entire brain in high-functioning adults with autism and matched healthy control participants. A measure of functional connectivity will be derived from the resting-state BOLD activity, by examining the functional coupling across all regions of the brain in a pairwise manner. In each of 4 specific aims, I will test the following hypotheses: (1) that the autistic brain is generally less connected than normal, but that there is anatomical specificity to this reduction, (2) that the functional responsivity of the entire brain can be examined simultaneously in autism using complex naturalistic stimuli, and can be used to reveal which regions function abnormally in autism, (3) that abnormal resting-state functional connectivity is associated with reduced evoked activity in those same regions, and (4) that the functional properties of broadly distributed brain regions contain information that can be used to predict a diagnosis of autism. Aims 1 & 2 will be carried out during the training phase (K99) of the grant, while Aims 3 & 4 will be completed during the independent phase (R00). The training component will consist of learning state-of-the-art functional imaging methods at the Caltech Brain Imaging Center, together with statistical techniques for pattern classification. Together, these studies will provide the first comprehensive picture of brain connectivity and brain activity in autism, and set the direction for my future career.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies will provide mentored training and research to help better understand brain connectivity in autism.

"Action for Health in Diabetes Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging Ancillary Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preservation of brain health is a critical goal in the care of adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who are at increased risk for atrophy, cerebrovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. Weight loss and increased physical activity hold promise as potentially effective strategies for this purpose, but are currently unproven in any population. Because unintended weight loss often precedes declines in later life brain health, a randomized controlled clinical trial is necessary, which must feature an effective behavioral intervention that is sustained over a long period of time in a large well characterized cohort. Mounting such a program de novo would be very expensive. Instead, we propose to make use of the ongoing and very successful Action for Health in Diabetes (Look AHEAD) randomized controlled clinical trial, adding cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to its extensive data collection protocol. This is feasible: participants in clinical trials have been repeatedly shown to be willing to join brain imaging studies and we have developed successful protocols for maintaining safety, confidentiality, and quality. This is novel: Look AHEAD and the state-of-the-art MRI protocols that we propose provide an unprecedented opportunity to assess the long-term effectiveness of mid-life behavioral changes on brain structure and function and to advance understanding of brain health in diabetes. We address an important public health priority for a rapidly growing and under-studied segment of the US population in a cost-effective manner, leveraging the extensive research resources available from Look AHEAD. We respond to PAR-09-247, which targets ancillary study applications to major NIDDK clinical trials, including Look AHEAD.  We will enroll 496 participants, ages 55-85 years with type 2 diabetes, from 3 Look AHEAD clinics. They will have been randomly assigned 10 years ago when they were obese or overweight, with equal probability, to either an ongoing intensive lifestyle intervention that has induced sustained weight loss and increased physical activity or control condition (diabetes support and education) that has fostered excellent retention. A proven protocol for standardized structural MRI will provide regional brain and ischemic lesion volumes; functional MRI will provide assessments of functional activation, resting state connectivity, and cerebral blood flow. A tested cognitive battery and physical activity assessment will be administered. A comprehensive analysis of these data will make use of established statistical approaches and novel machine-learning methods.

"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.",Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging,8137829,K25AG033725,"['Adult', 'Aerobic', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'aging mind', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'gray matter', 'healthy aging', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'morphometry', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'relational memory', 'research study', 'response', 'sedentary', 'shape analysis', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,K25,2011,150833,0.074828419081061
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",8116049,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Sciences', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES,U01,2011,437768,-0.0302160810439477
"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7761665,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'addiction', 'adverse outcome', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2010,214701,0.04651028714864605
"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology. On its successful completion, based on specific milestones, we will move to the more applied work with human subjects.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. We are interested specifically in states and markers of impulsivity and cigarette craving. Our goal ultimately is to have a tool that can be used in the context of neurofeedback, allowing human subject or patient to receive an indication of activity in their brains associated with these states and to enable them to learn to control these cognitive/affective states by controlling the brain activity.           Project Narrative Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography.

"Electrocorticography signals for human hand prosthetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurological injury (such as from stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury) is a major cause of permanent disability.  Recent advances in the field of neuroprosthetics hold enormous potential for the development of brain-computer interfaces to restore neurological function.  This project will lead to a system that can control a robotic hand using recordings from the surface of the brain.  Interfaces based directly from brain signals may allow for direct decoding of control signals for maximally efficient prosthetics.  This project, a collaboration between neurosurgery, computer science, and physics departments, will explore the brain signals underlying hand movement using electrocorticography, or ECoG.  We have previously shown that high frequency (>75Hz) components of the ECoG carry information about local brain activity.  In the first aim, we will expand our understanding of the high-frequency signal components that correlate with individual finger movements.  We will extract broadband changes in ECoG from non-specific alpha and beta rhythms using PCA and enhance finger classification with machine learning algorithms.  In the second aim, we will look for control signals reflecting different hand functions, rather than movement of different fingers.  For instance, we will examine if pinch and grasp behaviors give more separable high- frequency ECoG signals.  We will also examine the behavior of these movements at higher spatial resolution.  In the third aim, we will measure ECoG changes associated with imagined movement and how these changes are altered with visual feedback when applied to a robotic hand.  In the final aim, we will add tactile feedback to the control to optimize ECoG-based control of a hand prosthesis.  By increasingly advancing the complexity of the control signal, and the complexity of the robotic hand output, we will establish if ECoG is a viable source of control signal for a hand neuroprosthetic device.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The development of a hand neuroprosthetic, or artificial device that interacts with the nervous system could restore function to those afflicted by stroke, brain injury, spinal cord injury, or neurodegenerative diseases that have damaged the use of a hand or arm.

"Advanced methods for lesion-symptom mapping in aphasia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesion analysis plays a central role in cognitive neuroscience, complementing functional activation studies by identifying brain regions that are necessary for the performance of particular functions.

"Transmission of Information in the Visual System How do we identify an object from the features that we detect? Understanding how the brain recognizes objects might give insight into how the brain solves problems in general. The object recognition problem has withstood a century of attempts, but we bring new tools ¿ fruits of the last grant period ¿ that allow us to sketch the outlines of a solution. Four approaches, all new and different, converge on one answer. AIM 1. Use crowding, along with other manipulations, to characterize three parallel processes in reading by normal and dyslexic readers. AIM 2. Count features by probability summation. Extending traditional probability summation from explaining just detection to also explain object identification, we acquire a new tool, allowing us to count the number of features the observer must detect in order to identify. AIM 3. Capture the observer's classification algorithm by computer modeling of the observer's responses to thousands of letters in white noise. We use statistical learning theory to build a classifier that accounts for human performance. The observer classifies each of several thousand images of a letter in noise as ""a"", ""b"", or ""c"", etc. These classifications are data that can tell us what the observer is doing. We use a powerful statistical learning algorithm to create a simple classifier that best models human performance. AIM 4. fMRI: Where in the brain are letters identified? Correlate the activation of the ""letter"" area in the left fusiform gyrus, and elsewhere, with two psychophysically-discovered signatures of letter identification: fast learning and channel frequency. Thus techniques from cognition, perception, statistical learning theory, and physiology together will reveal what is computed where, in the brain, when an observer identifies an object. n/a",Transmission of Information in the Visual System,7765534,R01EY004432,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Frequencies', 'Fruit', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Noise', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Schools', 'Solutions', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'detector', 'insight', 'object recognition', 'parallel processing', 'peripheral reading', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,324963,0.030828392183413038
"Manipulating Neural Tissue with Ultra-Short Laser Pulses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We seek to renew our joint discovery and technology based bioengineering research partnership (BRP).  Our program advances the use of amplified ultrashort laser pulses as a tool to manipulate living and histological tissue.  This unique technology, pioneered by the BRP team, permits tissue to be cut on the micrometer scale by light-fueled plasma-meditated ablation.  Cutting occurs without thermal damage and can be combined with spectroscopic feedback to identify and limit the region being perturbed.  We advance this technology in new ways, including the use of temporal focusing for deep ablation, and apply it to three key test beds.  The first is construction of the angiotome, i.e., a complete vectorized map of cortical vasculature; here we use plasma mediated ablation to automate a form of block-face imaging along with novel algorithms to filter and vectorize features in the data.  The second is the study of neuronal viability in response to perturbations of subcortical blood flow; here we use plasma-mediated ablation to block flow in individual targeted microvessels that lie below the cortical surface.  The third test bed is the automation of cranial and spinal surgery; we combine plasma-mediated ablation with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy to cut bone yet avoid injury to soft tissue.  These investigations are particularly relevant to diagnosing and understanding microinfarctions, i.e., damage to the brain as the result of damage to single cortical vessels, that accumulate with age and trauma.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  These studies advance the use of light to image and manipulate the flow of blood in the brain.  We make use of rats and mice as model systems for our experiments.  The new capabilities from the proposed work hold two promises for advances in medicine:  One is an understanding of micro- infarctions - lesions of individual blood vessels in cortex that lead to the death of brain cells- that accrue with age and trauma.

"Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal for an NIH Mentored Quantitative Research Career Award requests support for Dr. Yongmei Michelle Wang as she embarks on a faculty career focused on imaging studies which examine the influence of longitudinal interventions on brain structure and function, and its relationship to cognition and performance, in older adults. The application proposes a research career development plan in the field of neuroimaging, bridging engineering, statistics, and neuroscience. The plan includes two overlapping phases: 1) a didactic phase that emphasizes training, including coursework and laboratory work in the area of cognitive neuroscience, imaging, aging, and interventions to complement Dr. Wang's doctoral training in Electrical Engineering and existing experience in Statistics; and 2) a development phase that focuses on intense development of the proposed research. These two phases will be closely supervised by the mentor and advisor in the area of cognitive neuroscience, brain plasticity, biomedical imaging, aging and interventions. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI), have been shown to be powerful for characterizing and understanding the structure and function of the human brain. There remains a need, however, for robust and efficient statistical image analysis methods due to the limitations of existing approaches. It is crucial that these analysis techniques be developed with a full understanding of the neuroimaging methods used and the relevant cognitive neuroscience. We propose to develop, implement, and validate integrated computational algorithms for reliable and sensitive analysis of brain MRI and fMRI images, with the following specific aims: 1) Develop, validate and combine novel and efficient univariate and multivariate morphometry analysis methods. 2) Develop and evaluate integrated functional hemodynamic response and connectivity study approaches. 3) Apply these methods to the MRI and fMRI data being collected from separately funded NIA project of the mentor, to examine the effects of aerobic fitness training on brain structure and function of older adults; the neuroscience hypothesis to be tested are: improvements in aerobic fitness, over the course of a 1 year intervention, will result in i) increases in gray and white matter volume and shape changes of subcortical structures of the human brain; and ii) changes in the underlying neural circuits. 4) Develop a brain image analysis toolbox implementing the above methods.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The development of quantitative image analysis methodology for the characterization of brain structural and functional changes caused by interventions (such as fitness) on the aging brain is of tremendous importance to understanding the effects of interventions on brain, and to the design of interventions that optimize the effects on cognition and brain health.",Quantitative Methods for Neuroimaging Studies of Interventions in Aging,7989936,K25AG033725,"['Adult', 'Aerobic', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Award', 'Awareness', 'Bayesian Method', 'Behavior', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'Computational algorithm', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Deterioration', 'Development', 'Development Plans', 'Dimensions', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electrical Engineering', 'Engineering', 'Exhibits', 'Faculty', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Gray unit of radiation dose', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Studies', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Physical activity', 'Population', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk Behaviors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Seeds', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'aging mind', 'base', 'bioimaging', 'career', 'career development', 'clinical application', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fitness', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'hemodynamics', 'improved', 'interest', 'intervention effect', 'morphometry', 'neural circuit', 'neuroimaging', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'relational memory', 'research study', 'response', 'sedentary', 'shape analysis', 'social', 'statistics', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'white matter', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,K25,2010,150781,0.074828419081061
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims.

"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7599700,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'addiction', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2009,216795,0.04651028714864605
"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology. On its successful completion, based on specific milestones, we will move to the more applied work with human subjects.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. We are interested specifically in states and markers of impulsivity and cigarette craving.

"Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and related electroencephalography (EEG) use an array of sensors to non-invasively measure electromagnetic (EM) fields produced by synchronous current activity within the brain. While the temporal resolution is excellent relative to other functional imaging modalities, accurately localizing in 3D space the sources of brain activity involves solving a difficult, underdetermined inverse problem. Existing localization methods used clinically and for research purposes maintain significant shortcomings, including the inability to resolve complex source configurations, bias caused by source correlations, and sensitivity to sources of noise and interference. The latter can arise from eye blinks, heart beats, sensor imperfections, and industrial noise as well as from spontaneous background brain activity not associated with the brain sources of interest. Additionally, prototype algorithms ostensibly designed to deal with some of these issues are heuristic in nature and have not been rigorously evaluated or compared, making their ultimate utility difficult to assess for neuroelectromagnetic imaging practitioners. The proposed research plan addresses all of these concerns by developing a principled localization scheme that unifies and extends existing localization strategies using modern concepts from Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Based on the notion of automatic relevance determination (ARD), brain regions with probable (relevant) activity are located with high spatial resolution. Interference sources are effectively removed by integrating with a variation factor analysis model. To quantify the improvement afforded by the proposed methodology, source location estimates will be compared with standard algorithms using realistic simulations, near-ground-truth data obtained from invasive electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings, and surgical data. The result will be implemented as a user-friendly localization toolbox and made freely available to the community by integrating with existing open-source functional brain imaging software. Non-invasive mapping of brain activity with high spatio-temporal resolution has important consequences for basic neuroscience studies of human cognition. It also has profound implications for the diagnosis, characterization and treatment of various neurological, neurooncological, mental health, developmental, and communication disorders. For example, localizations of brain sources are used to map cognitive function in epileptogenic areas and in neighboring brain regions. Such brain mapping procedures are then useful to guide neurosurgical planning, navigation, and resection and to minimize post-operative deficits.           n/a",Bayesian Methods for Localizing Dynamic Brain Activity and Epileptogenic Zones,7751495,F32NS061395,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Automation', 'Bayesian Method', 'Benchmarking', 'Binding', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blinking', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive Science', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Developmental Communication Disorders', 'Diagnosis', 'Diffuse', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetic Fields', 'Electromagnetics', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Excision', 'Experimental Designs', 'Exposure to', 'Factor Analysis', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Imaging', 'Heart', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Language', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Health', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Metric', 'Modeling', 'Morphologic artifacts', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Nutmeg - dietary', 'Occupations', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Postoperative Period', 'Procedures', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Relative (related person)', 'Research', 'Research Training', 'Resected', 'Resolution', 'Scalp structure', 'Scheme', 'Science', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Simulate', 'Sorting - Cell Movement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Surface', 'Surrogate Markers', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'career', 'cognitive function', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'design', 'genetic pedigree', 'heuristics', 'human CYP2B6 protein', 'human subject', 'imaging modality', 'interest', 'neurophysiology', 'open source', 'prototype', 'reconstruction', 'sensor', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'validation studies']",NINDS,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2009,46257,0.020468927468584867
"Transmission of Information in the Visual System How do we identify an object from the features that we detect? Understanding how the brain recognizes objects might give insight into how the brain solves problems in general. The object recognition problem has withstood a century of attempts, but we bring new tools ¿ fruits of the last grant period ¿ that allow us to sketch the outlines of a solution. Four approaches, all new and different, converge on one answer. AIM 1. Use crowding, along with other manipulations, to characterize three parallel processes in reading by normal and dyslexic readers. AIM 2. Count features by probability summation. Extending traditional probability summation from explaining just detection to also explain object identification, we acquire a new tool, allowing us to count the number of features the observer must detect in order to identify. AIM 3. Capture the observer's classification algorithm by computer modeling of the observer's responses to thousands of letters in white noise. We use statistical learning theory to build a classifier that accounts for human performance. The observer classifies each of several thousand images of a letter in noise as ""a"", ""b"", or ""c"", etc. These classifications are data that can tell us what the observer is doing. We use a powerful statistical learning algorithm to create a simple classifier that best models human performance. AIM 4. fMRI: Where in the brain are letters identified? Correlate the activation of the ""letter"" area in the left fusiform gyrus, and elsewhere, with two psychophysically-discovered signatures of letter identification: fast learning and channel frequency. Thus techniques from cognition, perception, statistical learning theory, and physiology together will reveal what is computed where, in the brain, when an observer identifies an object. n/a",Transmission of Information in the Visual System,7583948,R01EY004432,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Frequencies', 'Fruit', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Noise', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Schools', 'Solutions', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'detector', 'insight', 'object recognition', 'parallel processing', 'peripheral reading', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,328593,0.030828392183413038
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7668683,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early treatment', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'offspring', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2009,488655,-0.0302160810439477

"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype. Spatial information from static 3D contrast maps will be input to PCA-based and Voxel-based methods, Adaboosting and Learning with Side information 2) A temporally accounted intrasubject pattern of response to the inhibitory control challenge conditions in the fMRI paradigms will reveal group membership in both data sets. Temporal fMRl information wilt be used for Hidden Markov Models, Conditional Random Fields, etc. 3) A connectivity map corresponding to brain circuits functionally subserving inhibitory control wilt be revealed with indications of directionality of influence between brain regions by analyzing functional information with Dynamic Bayesian Networks, Dynamically Multi-Linked HMMs, etc. n/a",Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control,7440338,R01DA020949,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Aggressive behavior', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computational Technique', 'Computer Architectures', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Drug Addiction', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Genotype', 'Human', 'Impulsivity', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Process', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Side', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'addiction', 'approach behavior', 'assault', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'computer based statistical methods', 'human study', 'improved', 'markov model', 'middle column', 'monoamine', 'neuropsychological', 'novel', 'programs', 'response']",NIDA,STATE UNIVERSITY NEW YORK STONY BROOK,R01,2008,216244,0.04651028714864605
"Real-Time Automated Detection of Craving States with fMRI and EEG    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Neurofeedback by real time functional MRI (rt-fMRI) has potential for addiction research and treatment that will be realized only if the feedback given the subject is related meaningfully to the cognitive states that must be controlled. The mental operations of the brain are too distributed to be represented by the raw rt-fMRI signal in any one brain region or small group of regions. Our aims are to: 1) Use computational machine learning to rapidly detect patterned activation in the rt-fMRI signal that better expresses cognitive state; 2) augment these data with concurrently-collected electroencephalographic (EEG) data; 3) develop an atlas of brain data that identifies brain patterns with cognitive states relevant to addiction and drug abuse research and 4) to explore rt-fMRI neurofeedback using this rt-fMRI/EEG machine learning method. Our approach will be to first create rapid algorithms for pattern matching that are fast compared with the imaging, thereby allowing ""real-time"" application. To do so we will select features from the images that express the differences among state concisely (more technically, we will use a method known as independent components analysis to reduce the data dimensionality.) We will similarly condense the EEG features by studying them by the location of their sources within the brain, and by examining the frequencies that they contain. We will run experiments on volunteers designed to help us see their tendency to make impulsive choices - which is known to relate to their likelihood to become drug users, as well as experiments that track changes in their brain as they control their craving urges. For these studies we will look at heavy cigarette users. Cigarette use on its own is a serious health burden to the nation, and it is also an excellent model for addiction more generally, as it is known to have many neural features in common with use of other drugs of abuse, such as cocaine and methamphetamine. This is a phased innovation proposal. The first phase will be focused on the developments of the rt-fMRI analysis and instrumentation technology. On its successful completion, based on specific milestones, we will move to the more applied work with human subjects.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography. We are interested specifically in states and markers of impulsivity and cigarette craving. Our goal ultimately is to have a tool that can be used in the context of neurofeedback, allowing human subject or patient to receive an indication of activity in their brains associated with these states and to enable them to learn to control these cognitive/affective states by controlling the brain activity.           Project Narrative Our research aims to develop and characterize a means of rapidly detecting brain states relevant to addiction research through the use of magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography.

"Neuroimaging Predictors Of Cognitive Change And Response To Therapy Summary of work: The neuroanatomic and neurophysiologic underpinnings of age-associated cognitive and memory change remain unclear, as there are a limited number of studies of longitudinal brain changes in individuals without dementia. We are performing serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), and neuropsychological assessments in participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) to investigate the neurobiological basis of memory change. These evaluations allow us to examine changes in brain structure and function which may be early predictors of cognitive change and impairment, including Alzheimer's Disease (AD). An understanding of these associations and early detection of brain changes will be critical in identifying individuals likely to benefit from new interventions. Since 2005, we also have acquired 11-C-PIB PET imaging studies of amyloid distribution in the brain to enhance the identification of preclinical AD.  In addition, we are using neuroimaging tools to investigate modulators of cognitive and brain changes, including sex differences in brain aging, genetic risk factors and the effects of sex steroid and other hormones.   We continued the development and validation of new tools for processing images for longitudinal studies.  We published a number of papers investigating longitudinal age changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) to characterize patterns of change in functional activity in cognitively stable older adults(Beason-Held et al., Neurobiology of Aging, 2008; epub 2006).  We evaluated rCBF during rest and delayed verbal and figural recognition memory tasks at year 1 baseline and at year 9 in 25 BLSA participants who had maintained cognitive and physical health over the 8-year follow-up.  We investigated changes over time that were common across all three conditions and changes that were specific to either verbal or figural memory conditions.  Changes common to all scan conditions, as well as changes specific to either verbal or figural memory, were observed, and these changes reflected both regional increases and decreases in activity over time. In a second paper, we investigated the temporal patterns of these changes over time, investigating both linear and non-linear changes in rCBF patterns(Beason-Held et al., Neurobiology of Aging, 2008; epub 2006). Using data from Years 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 from the 25 participants who maintained cognitive and physical health, we found that many brain regions showed steady, progressive changes in rCBF over the 8 years while others maintained rCBF for a number of years before showing incremental declines or increases in activity, particularly in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain.  These findings suggest that there are distinctive patterns of age-related functional decline and compensatory activity over time in healthy, cognitively stable individuals, many of which involve regions that are crucial for memory and other higher order cognitive functions. The characterization of these patterns in cognitively normal individuals will aide distinguishing normal from pathological patterns of age-related functional change.    We also investigated modifiers of these functional brain changes over time, comparing changes in functional activity for individuals without hypertension to those with treated hypertension (Beason-Held et al, Stroke, 2007).  Relative to those without hypertension, the hypertension group showed greater rCBF decreases in prefrontal, anterior cingulate and occipital areas over time, suggesting that these regions are more susceptible to hypertension-related dysfunction with advancing age.  In another paper, we compared longitudinal rCBF changes over time in older BLSA participants who had stable (n=38) and progressively worsening (n=36) MRI white matter signal abnormalities over a period of approximately 8 years (Kraut et al., Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism, 2008; epub 2007).  Individuals with progressively worsening white matter abnormalities exhibited a different relationship between patterns of rCBF and severity of white matter abnormalities early in the development of these abnormalities and a different pattern of longitudinal change over time compared to those whose ratings of signal abnormalities remain stable.   In combination, these results show that vascular disease may modify longitudinal changes in brain function in older adults.  A major emphasis of our work over the last year has been the application of support vector machine learning algorithms to structural and functional imaging data to improve discrimination of cognitively normal from cognitively impaired individuals on an individual person-basis.  We published the first application of this approach to cognitive impairment using structural MRI data from 15 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 15 cognitively normal individuals matched for age, sex, and race  (Davatzikos et al. Neurobiology of Aging, 2008; epub 2006).  We demonstrated 90% classification accuracy using a single MRI scan and showed greater longitudinal increase in the abnormality score for the MCI compared with normal subjects.  In a second study, we showed that adding information from a resting PET rCBF scan to the structural MRI improved classification accuracy to 93% (Fan et al., NeuroImage 2008).    Using the 11-C-PIB PET scan data, we confirmed the experience at other centers that 20-30% of cognitively normal older adults have PIB positive scans, i.e., deposition of brain amyloid.  In addition, we investigated whether PIB retention was associated with longitudinal rCBF changes in the preceding years (Sojkova et al., Journal of Nuclear Medicine, in press).  PIB distribution volume ratios (DVR) of regions of interest were estimated by fitting a reference tissue model to the measured time activity curves, using the approach published in collaboration with Dr. Yun Zhou of Johns Hopkins (Zhou et al, Neuroimage, 2007).  The mean cortical DVR was used to divide participants into high and low PIB retention groups.  Greater longitudinal decreases in rCBF in the high PIB group were seen in right anterior/mid cingulate, right supramarginal gyrus, left thalamus and midbrain bilaterally relative to the low group. Greater increases in rCBF over time in the high PIB group were found in left medial and inferior frontal gyri, right precuneus, left inferior parietal lobule, and the left postcentral gyrus.  While longitudinal declines may reflect greater decrements in neuronal function in the high PIB group, greater longitudinal increases in rCBF are also observed in those with higher amyloid load and may represent a compensatory attempt to preserve neuronal function in these regions. n/a",Neuroimaging Predictors Of Cognitive Change And Response To Therapy,7732158,Z01AG000191,"['Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amyloid', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Baltimore', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Classification', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Condition', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Discrimination', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Elderly', 'Evaluation', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Health', 'Hormonal', 'Hormones', 'Hypertension', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Inferior frontal gyrus', 'Intervention', 'Journals', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Lobule', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Metabolism', 'Midbrain structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurons', 'Numbers', 'Paper', 'Parietal', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Persons', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Publishing', 'Race', 'Rate', 'Relative (related person)', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Scanning', 'Score', 'Severities', 'Sex Characteristics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Structure of postcentral gyrus', 'Structure of supramarginal gyrus', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Tissue Model', 'Validation', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'cognitive change', 'cognitive function', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'functional decline', 'genetic risk factor', 'image processing', 'improved', 'interest', 'memory recognition', 'mild neurocognitive impairment', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropathology', 'neuropsychological', 'pre-clinical', 'response', 'sex', 'tool', 'white matter']",NIA,NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON AGING,Z01,2008,1075261,-0.005282523212959162
"Development of a Bidirectional Brain Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have made it possible to move a robotic device in real time, using signals obtained directly from the brain. This field of Brain Machine Interface (BMI) has the means to provide movement for paralyzed patients, communication for locked-in patients, and a better understanding of the brain for all of society. In order to control movement effectively, the brain must be able to activate muscles appropriately, and monitor the evolving movement quickly and precisely. Existing BMIs for, while remarkable, do each of these tasks in poor imitation of the intact nervous system. Our proposed work addresses these limitations by developing a bidirectional interface that produces movement in a more natural way, and provides feedback about the movement by direct, electrical stimulation of the brain. Our partnership includes members at Northwestern Univ (NU), Univ of Chicago (UC), Univ of Mass, Amherst (UMass), and the autonomous Univ of Mexico (UNAM). Partners have advanced degrees in a range of biological science, computer science, physics, mathematics, and engineering disciplines. Miller (NU) will coordinate the partnership. He has extensive experience with a wide range of recording, stimulation and behavioral protocols in behaving monkeys. Hatsopoulos (UC) is at the forefront of the field of multi-electrode recordings. He was a leading member of the first group to demonstrate visually guided BMI control by a primate. Barto (U Mass) has done pioneering research in neural networks, machine learning and stochastic optimization. Fagg (UMass) is an authority in the control of reaching and grasping robots that learn to interact with the environment. Together they will develop the decoders of activity from the brain used to cause movement. Romo (UNAM), is a world leader in studies of the perceptual and decision making processes induced by electrical stimulation of the brain. Solla (NU) is an expert in neural networks and information theory. With Romo, she will develop optimal routines to encode information in stimulus trains to provide feedback to the brain.

"Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R03 proposal aims at developing a methodological framework for nonlinear multivariate analysis, using a non-linear pattern classification method, to identify and quantify subtle and spatially-complex brain abnormalities in unaffected family members of schizophrenia patients. Compared to conventional methods based on regions of interest (ROI) that rely only on a few pre-selected manually-labeled ROIs, this automated method will consider all brain regions simultaneously for identification of complex patterns of brain abnormality that cannot be necessarily summarized by a few pre-defined ROIs. Accordingly, a major methodological challenge to be addressed in this project is the development of statistical image analysis and data mining methods for estimating the collection of brain regions or networks that jointly form patterns to characterize schizophrenia as uniquely as possible. Patterns determined by comparison of confirmed schizophrenia patients and healthy controls will be examined on unaffected family members of patients, to test whether individuals that are genetically related to patients display, to some extent, endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Also, unaffected family members will be further compared with patients to identify the morphological profiles that seem directly associated with the phenotype of schizophrenia. The performance of the proposed nonlinear pattern analysis and classification method will be tested on an existing schizophrenia dataset in the Schizophrenia Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Although not an immediate goal of this specific proposal, the long-term objective of the proposed work is to apply this automated methodology to various studies, including (1) a large-scale genetic study of schizophrenia involving informative samples, in order to examine questions that cannot be addressed with conventional ROI-based analysis; (2) the quantification and recognition of endophenotypes of schizophrenia in unaffected individuals, which can potentially pave the way for the detection of adolescents that possess brain endophenotypes that put them at risk; (3) clinical studies investigating the added value of quantifying endophenotypes of schizophrenia for clinical diagnosis, especially in difficult cases or outside environments with well-trained psychiatrists, in which unbiased computer-based methods can potentially greatly assist in clinical evaluation and diagnosis.           n/a",Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients,7325760,R03MH076970,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Psychiatrist', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'data mining', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'member', 'research clinical testing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2008,65055,0.03669658968261451

"Transmission of Information in the Visual System How do we identify an object from the features that we detect? Understanding how the brain recognizes objects might give insight into how the brain solves problems in general. The object recognition problem has withstood a century of attempts, but we bring new tools ¿ fruits of the last grant period ¿ that allow us to sketch the outlines of a solution. Four approaches, all new and different, converge on one answer. AIM 1. Use crowding, along with other manipulations, to characterize three parallel processes in reading by normal and dyslexic readers. AIM 2. Count features by probability summation. Extending traditional probability summation from explaining just detection to also explain object identification, we acquire a new tool, allowing us to count the number of features the observer must detect in order to identify. AIM 3. Capture the observer's classification algorithm by computer modeling of the observer's responses to thousands of letters in white noise. We use statistical learning theory to build a classifier that accounts for human performance. The observer classifies each of several thousand images of a letter in noise as ""a"", ""b"", or ""c"", etc. These classifications are data that can tell us what the observer is doing. We use a powerful statistical learning algorithm to create a simple classifier that best models human performance. AIM 4. fMRI: Where in the brain are letters identified? Correlate the activation of the ""letter"" area in the left fusiform gyrus, and elsewhere, with two psychophysically-discovered signatures of letter identification: fast learning and channel frequency. Thus techniques from cognition, perception, statistical learning theory, and physiology together will reveal what is computed where, in the brain, when an observer identifies an object. n/a",Transmission of Information in the Visual System,7350139,R01EY004432,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Brain', 'Cells', 'Child', 'Classification', 'Cognition', 'Computer Simulation', 'Computer-Assisted Image Analysis', 'Condition', 'Count', 'Crowding', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnostic', 'Frequencies', 'Fruit', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Fusiform gyrus', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Image', 'Knock-out', 'Learning', 'Left', 'Letters', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Noise', 'Numbers', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Physiology', 'Probability', 'Problem Solving', 'Process', 'Psychophysiology', 'Rate', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Schools', 'Solutions', 'Stimulus', 'Stroke', 'Sum', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Time', 'Ursidae Family', 'Visual system structure', 'Weight', 'Work', 'detector', 'insight', 'object recognition', 'parallel processing', 'peripheral reading', 'receptive field', 'research study', 'response', 'size', 'theories', 'tool', 'transmission process']",NEI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,322249,0.030828392183413038
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7502725,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'human study', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2008,474412,-0.0302160810439477
"Machine Learning for Analysis of functional MRI of Underlying Inhibitory Control DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods.

"SVM based group data analysis for drug abuse disorder ASL perfusion study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MRI provides a potentially extremely useful tool for drug abuse/addiction studies due to the noninvasive cerebral blood flow (CBF) measurement and immunity to low frequency MR signal drift effects that degrade functional MRI based on BOLD contrast over time. However, data processing through conventional univariate general linear model (GLM) based methods has proved extremely challenging for ASL data due to its intrinsic low SNR, the increased motion and agitation typically present during drug craving states, and the ""patchy flow"" defects commonly found in the brains of patients with certain types of chronic substance abuse (e.g., cocaine). Assuming a linear brain response to the functional stimuli and ignoring the abundant spatial brain activity coupling, the standard GLM is initially sub-optimal for fMRI data analysis. Modeling each voxel's time series with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF), it may be further ill-posed to drug abuse studies since the actual shape of HRF may differ significantly in the addicted patient's brain from the canonical one and may differ significantly from patient to patient, from voxel to voxel. A more powerful data analysis method is fundamentally demanded for drug abuse/addiction ASL perfusion studies. The goal of this project is to develop a multivariate and brain response modeling-free fMRI data processing method and to use it for revealing the drug craving related brain activation patterns within existing drug abuse/addiction ASL perfusion fMRI data in our center. A machine-learning algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM), will be used to extract a spatial discriminance map between different experimental conditions for each subject, and a statistic framework will be provided to give a population inference about the extracted discriminance (Aim 1). We hypothesize that this machine-learning based data processing will increase the detection sensitivity of ASL perfusion fMRI as compared to the conventional GLM approach because of the data driven nature and multivariate processing of SVM. To verify this hypothesis and to validate the sensitivity, specificity and reliability of the proposed methods, we propose to acquire 40 normal controls' null-hypothesis ASL perfusion fMRI data and sensory-motor task data in Aim 2. The last but the most important aim (Aim 3) is to apply the proposed method to analyze the existing drug abuse/addiction ASL perfusion fMRI data in our center. In addition to the basic science implications for ASL perfusion fMRI and BOLD fMRI, we believe this line of work will provide critical information, e.g., more precise diagnostic measurement, and prediction of treatment or medication response for the current cocaine and nicotine addiction/relapse vulnerability studies. The output of these more powerful ASL data analysis methods will also pave the way for general application of ASL perfusion fMRI methods across multiple brain disorders, and for sustained states within the normal brain.          n/a",SVM based group data analysis for drug abuse disorder ASL perfusion study,7385333,R03DA023496,"['Agitation', 'Algorithms', 'Arterial Disorder', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chronic', 'Cigarette', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Cocaine', 'Cocaine Dependence', 'Cognitive', 'Condition', 'Coupling', 'Cues', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Defect', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Drug Addiction', 'Drug abuse', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Immune', 'Immunity', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motion', 'Motor', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Perfusion', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Statistics', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Relapse', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Sensory', 'Series', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Spin Labels', 'Standards of Weights and Measures', 'Stimulus', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'blood flow measurement', 'computerized data processing', 'craving', 'drug craving', 'experience', 'hemodynamics', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'nicotine craving', 'response', 'size', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2007,236250,0.0017767393081917365
"Development of a Bidirectional Brain Machine Interface    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent technological advances have made it possible to move a robotic device in real time, using signals obtained directly from the brain. This field of Brain Machine Interface (BMI) has the means to provide movement for paralyzed patients, communication for locked-in patients, and a better understanding of the brain for all of society.

"Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This R03 proposal aims at developing a methodological framework for nonlinear multivariate analysis, using a non-linear pattern classification method, to identify and quantify subtle and spatially-complex brain abnormalities in unaffected family members of schizophrenia patients. Compared to conventional methods based on regions of interest (ROI) that rely only on a few pre-selected manually-labeled ROIs, this automated method will consider all brain regions simultaneously for identification of complex patterns of brain abnormality that cannot be necessarily summarized by a few pre-defined ROIs. Accordingly, a major methodological challenge to be addressed in this project is the development of statistical image analysis and data mining methods for estimating the collection of brain regions or networks that jointly form patterns to characterize schizophrenia as uniquely as possible. Patterns determined by comparison of confirmed schizophrenia patients and healthy controls will be examined on unaffected family members of patients, to test whether individuals that are genetically related to patients display, to some extent, endophenotypes of schizophrenia. Also, unaffected family members will be further compared with patients to identify the morphological profiles that seem directly associated with the phenotype of schizophrenia. The performance of the proposed nonlinear pattern analysis and classification method will be tested on an existing schizophrenia dataset in the Schizophrenia Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania. Although not an immediate goal of this specific proposal, the long-term objective of the proposed work is to apply this automated methodology to various studies, including (1) a large-scale genetic study of schizophrenia involving informative samples, in order to examine questions that cannot be addressed with conventional ROI-based analysis; (2) the quantification and recognition of endophenotypes of schizophrenia in unaffected individuals, which can potentially pave the way for the detection of adolescents that possess brain endophenotypes that put them at risk; (3) clinical studies investigating the added value of quantifying endophenotypes of schizophrenia for clinical diagnosis, especially in difficult cases or outside environments with well-trained psychiatrists, in which unbiased computer-based methods can potentially greatly assist in clinical evaluation and diagnosis.           n/a",Brain abnormality in unaffected family members of schizophrenic patients,7195436,R03MH076970,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computers', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Family member', 'First Degree Relative', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Hand', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Label', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neuroanatomy', 'Patient Education', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Psychiatrist', 'Relative Risks', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Structure', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'data mining', 'endophenotype', 'gray matter', 'interest', 'lateral ventricle', 'member', 'research clinical testing']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R03,2007,78604,0.03669658968261451
"Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This new application is part of the competitive renewal for the ""Collaborative Initiative on Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (CIFASD)"". One of the overall goals of the entire CIFASD during this renewal period is to determine if innovative techniques can be used to identify brain alterations, neurobehavioral deficits and facial characteristics and relationships between these variables to help define prenatal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). To help address this overarching question, we will use quantitative brain mapping techniques with high-resolution structural and functional MRI collected both cross-sectionally and longitudinally from 80 FASD children evaluated across 3 multi-cultural data collection sites (San Diego, Los Angeles and Capetown, South Africa). While this brain imaging project can independently achieve some of the goals of the CIFASD by identifying brain structural and functional abnormalities across the broad spectrum of FASD, critically this funding opportunity will allow the assessment of relationships between the brain, neurocognitive deficits and facial dysmorphology through our active collaborations with the neurobehavioral project (Mattson PI), the facial imaging project (Foroud PI), and the dysmorphology core (Jones PI). Controlled animal studies are essential to determine timing and dosages of prenatal alcohol that result in FASD, but human imaging studies are essential to corroborate anatomical findings across species. Through our association with the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, we have access to state-of-the-art brain mapping tools that allow the morphological evaluation of any brain structure that can be identified with MRI. Thus, we are in a unique position to allow findings in animal studies to drive hypothesis-based analyses in the human imaging data. The proposed longitudinal project will highlight how an integrated approach relating neurobehavioral, functional and structural brain imaging data, and measures of facial morphology might yield important new insights on the complex nature of brain-behavior interactions and how they are altered by prenatal alcohol exposure. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to undertake such challenges, and participation, in the CIFASD is essential to address our specific aims. Ultimately, as part of the CIFASD, this project will enhance the capability for definitive FASD diagnoses that, in turn, will help clinicians manage and treat neurobehavioral deficits and associated secondary disabilities.           n/a","Mapping the Brain, the Face and Neurocognitive Function in FASD (U01)",7343320,U01AA017122,"['Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Development', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'Age', 'Alcohol consumption', 'Alcohol-Related Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Alcohols', 'Animal Model', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Arts', 'Basic Science', 'Behavioral', 'Binding Sites', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cells', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Choline', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Control Animal', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Dietary Intervention', 'Disease', 'Disorder by Site', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Design', 'Dysmorphology', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early Intervention', 'Elements', 'Emotional', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Ethanol', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Ethnic group', 'Evaluation', 'Face', 'Fetal Alcohol Exposure', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder', 'Fetal Alcohol Syndrome', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Inferior', 'Informal Social Control', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Language', 'Language Development', 'Lead', 'Length', 'Life', 'Los Angeles', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Morphology', 'Moscow', 'Mothers', 'Mus', 'Nature', 'Neonatal', 'Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurocognitive Deficit', 'New Mexico', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Play', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Principal Investigator', 'Productivity', 'Rattus', 'Recording of previous events', 'Relative (related person)', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scheme', 'Schools', 'Score', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Shapes', 'Sheep', 'Signal Pathway', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'South Africa', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Supplementation', 'Surface', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Three-Dimensional Imaging', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ukraine', 'Ultrasonography', 'Verbal Learning', 'Visual', 'Woman', 'Work', 'alcohol exposure', 'alcohol sensitivity', 'analog', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain morphology', 'brain size', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive function', 'critical developmental period', 'data integration', 'disability', 'dosage', 'drinking', 'follow-up', 'frontal lobe', 'gray matter', 'human study', 'improved', 'in utero', 'in vivo', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'literacy', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurodevelopment', 'northern plains', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'programs', 'prospective', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'social', 'three dimensional structure', 'tool']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2007,496998,-0.0302160810439477

"CRCNS: Machine Learning for Analysis of fMRI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compromised inhibitory control is a hallmark neuropsychological deficit underlying complex disorders and behaviors as drug addiction and aggression. Individuals with compromised mechanisms of control are difficult to identify unless they are subjected to challenging conditions directly. This is possibly due to the subtle ways in which poor inhibitory control is expressed in their baseline functioning, making classification and most importantly, prediction of future behavior, extremely challenging. We propose novel computational techniques to analyze brain-behavior relationships underlying mechanisms of inhibitory control, focusing on performing classification of hard-to-categorize groups of subjects based on brain activation response patterns to behavioral challenges of inhibitory control using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRl). These classification methods are applied on two distinct datasets: one of substance dependent individuals and the other of individuals with a particular genotype conferring vulnerability to poor inhibitory control. We hypothesize that unique patterns of variability in brain function can assist in identification of brain mechanisms rooted in compromised inhibitory control. Such patterns will increase our understanding of brain connectivity and circuitry as we move iteratively between a-priori and exploratory means of describing circuits of inhibitory control. Machine Learning techniques have been shown to be successful in discovering optimal features and patterns in complex high dimensional datasets. The diversity of the underlying questions when studying inhibitory control and the subtlety of the effects that can be used for classification, motivate us to propose an integrated machine learning framework for the joint exploration of spatial, temporal and functional information for the analysis of fMRI signals, thus allowing the testing of hypotheses and development of applications that are not supported by traditional analysis methods. We hypothesize that: 1) A differential  spatial brain pattern will indicate a diagnosis of drug addiction and a membership in one or another level ol MAOA genotype.

"Adult Optical Non-Invasive Brain Oxygenation Monitor    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  There is a need for a non-invasive and continuous bedside monitor for brain oxygenation for adult human patients. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an optically based technique that could meet such demand.  However, NIRS instruments have yet to achieve their initially expected potential of becoming routine clinical monitors complementary to pulse oximetry. One major challenge is to develop an optical transducer probe and a corresponding algorithm to solve the problem of interference from extracerebral tissue (skin, scalp, and skull) in adult NIRS applications. Another major challenge is to develop an algorithm that will be able to absolutely quantify the optical signals to derive quantitative variables or indices that are of clinical significance. Our goal is to resolve these challenges to develop an NIRS monitor that will determine absolute brain hemoglobin oxygen saturation on adult patients.  The primary objectives of this SBIR proposal are: 1) Design and construct an NIRS monitor for use on adult human patients; 2) Determine the optimum adult NIRS probe configuration to minimize extracerebral interference 3) Evaluate and validate novel adult NIRS algorithms that further minimize extracerebral interference and determine absolute brain oxygen saturation.         n/a",Adult Optical Non-Invasive Brain Oxygenation Monitor,6585412,R43NS045488,"['artificial intelligence', ' bioimaging /biomedical imaging', ' biomedical equipment development', ' brain circulation', ' infrared spectrometry', ' noninvasive diagnosis', ' optics', ' oxygen transport', ' patient monitoring device', ' respiratory oxygenation', ' swine']",NINDS,"CAS MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INC.",R43,2003,100000,0.04056120376879806
"SPATIAL-SYMBOLIC BRAIN INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM In the past two decades, new imaging technology has given neurologists noninvasive tools that reveal the structure of the brain with a clarity that is little short of miraculous.  At the same time, neuroscientists, usually in animal studies, have developed ways to reveal hundreds of chemical and functional features of the brain that are relevant to human brain function.

"Cross-frequency coupling: its role in brain function and dysfunction Abstract  One of the high priority research areas listed in the BRAIN 2025 Report is a better understanding of the brain network dynamics across time and space from human electrophysiological recordings. The RFA-MH-20- 120 “BRAIN Initiative: Secondary Analysis and Archiving of BRAIN Initiative Data” specifically focuses on the use of large volumes of existing data stored in open access public databases. In the proposed studies, we will perform an innovative secondary analysis of existing intracranial EEG records from patients with medicine- resistant epilepsy collected during their presurgical evaluation. These records from public repositories would allow us to study dynamic interactions between hippocampal and neocortical structures during the development of pathological activity as well as during verbal memory tasks. We will use a novel and rapidly developing approach from the realm of machine learning algorithms namely, deep learning neural networks. Physiological mechanisms of memory formation and consolidation as well as pathophysiological mechanisms of epilepsy are poorly understood. The main hypothesis of this proposal is that physiological function and dysfunction of the hippocampal-neocortical system may have a common mechanism that depends on the dynamic interaction of electrophysiological oscillations in the system. Brain oscillations have been suggested to be involved in information transfer within and between brain networks by modulating neural excitability at different spatial and temporal scales. The interaction of oscillations across different time scales is referred to as ‘cross-frequency coupling’ and it represents a high-order structure in the functional organization of brain rhythms. Aberrant patterns of cross-frequency coupling may lead to memory dysfunction as well as facilitate the propagation of pathological activity. At present, the field does not have a mechanistically justified criterion to distinguish between physiological and pathological oscillations especially regarding their high-order interactions. We will study cross- frequency coupling during the interictal-ictal transition (Aim 1) and during successful and unsuccessful verbal memory performance (Aim 2) using Deep Learning algorithms. One of the study goals is to create a neural network capable of recognizing patterns of cross-frequency coupling as biomarkers of different physiological and pathological functional states of the brain. A comprehensive characterization of cross-frequency coupling would allow us to distinguish between physiological and aberrant forms of interaction between brain networks at different time scales. The study results will deepen our knowledge about the functional organization of brain rhythms and will provide a new method to recognize functional states from electrophysiological records of brain activity. This method will be applicable for a more accurate monitoring, diagnosis and treatment of memory impairments in neurological and mental disorders as well as for the development of new tools for seizure prediction and control. Public Health Relevance Statement  A better understanding of brain dynamics from human electrophysiological recordings will help us find new ways to treat neurological and mental disorders and the BRAIN Initiative encourages the secondary analysis of large amounts of existing data. The proposed study will analyze intracranial EEG records from human participants stored in public data repositories using artificial intelligence methods. The results will deepen our knowledge of brain function and dysfunction and will pave the way for the development of new methods to diagnose and treat brain disorders.",Cross-frequency coupling: its role in brain function and dysfunction,10008042,RF1MH123192,"['Anatomy', 'Animals', 'Archives', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Evaluation', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Goals', 'Health', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Monitor', 'Motor', 'Neocortex', 'Participant', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiological', 'Play', 'Probability', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Reporting', 'Research Priority', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Seizures', 'Slow-Wave Sleep', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Structure', 'Supervision', 'System', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Time', 'Training', 'cognitive process', 'data warehouse', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'deep neural network', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'learning network', 'machine learning algorithm', 'memory encoding', 'memory process', 'mind control', 'neocortical', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural network', 'new technology', 'novel', 'public health relevance', 'public repository', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'tool']",NIMH,GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,839700,0.04642059393853113
"Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Project Summary/Abstract: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum Brain monitoring in critical care has grown dramatically over the past 20 years with the discovery that a large proportion of ICU patients suffer from subclinical seizures and seizure-like electrical events, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), detectable only by electroencephalography (EEG). This growth has created a crisis in critical care: It is clear that IIICAs damage the brain and cause permanent neurologic disability. Yet detection of IIICAs by expert visual review is often delayed suggesting we need better tools for real-time monitoring, to cope with the deluge of ICU EEG data. In other cases, IIICAs appear to be harmless epiphenomena, and many worry that increased awareness of IIICAs has created an epidemic of overly-aggressive prescribing of anticonvulsant drugs leading to preventable adverse events and costs. This crisis highlights critical unmet needs for automated EEG monitoring for IIICAs, and a better understanding of which types of IIICAs cause neural injury and warrant intervention. Causes of IIICAs range widely, from primary brain injuries like hemorrhagic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, to systemic medical illnesses like sepsis and uremia. Until recently, this massive clinical heterogeneity has been an insurmountable barrier to understanding the impact of IIICAs on neurologic outcome. However, recent advances in deep learning, coupled with the unprecedented availability of a massive dataset developed by our team over the last three years, makes it feasible for the first time to systematically study the relationship between IIICAs and neurologic outcomes. To meet the need for better monitoring tools and better models for understanding IIICAs, we will take a deep learning approach to leverage the as-yet untapped information in a massive ICU EEG dataset. We will pursue three Specific Aims: SA1: Comprehensively label all occurrences of IIICAs in a massive set of cEEG recordings, thus preparing the EEG data for training computers to detect IIICA patterns; SA2: Develop supervised DL algorithms to detect IIICAs as accurately as human experts, thus providing powerful tools for both research on IIICAs and for clinical brain monitoring; SA3: Estimate the effect of IIICAs on neurologic outcome: we will develop models to quantify effects of IIICAs on risk for disability after controlling for inciting illness and other clinical factors, and to predict effects of interventions to suppress IIICAs. This work will provide four crucial benefits to advance the field of precision critical care neurology, and by extension, our ability to provide optimal neurologic care for patients during critical illness. 1) Improved understanding of the clinical significance of seizure like IIICA states; 2) development of robust tools and algorithms for critical care brain telemetry; 3) a unique, massive, publicly available, thoroughly annotated dataset that will enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials. Project Narrative: Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum RELEVANCE: Seizures and seizure-like brain activity, collectively called “ictal-interictal-injury continuum abnormalities” (IIICAs), occur commonly in electroencephalogram recordings of brain activity in ICU patients, and simultaneously represent a preventable cause of brain injury and a common cause of over-treatment and iatrogenic harm to patients. Big Data and deep learning approaches have recently enabled advances in several fields of medicine, but have so far had little impact in ICU neuromedicine. This project will use Big Data and Deep Learning to advance the goal of protecting brain health in ICU patients, by 1) providing improved understanding of the clinical significance of IIICA states; 2) developing robust tools and algorithms for ICU brain telemetry; 3) creating a unique, massive, publicly available, annotated dataset to enable other researchers to further advance the field; and 4) developing a testable model that predicts which types of cEEG abnormalities warrant aggressive treatment, setting the stage for interventional trials.",Big Data and Deep Learning for the Interictal-Ictal-Injury Continuum,9942528,R01NS107291,"['Adverse event', 'Algorithms', 'Anesthetics', 'Anticonvulsants', 'Awareness', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Injuries', 'Brain hemorrhage', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Computers', 'Coupled', 'Critical Care', 'Critical Illness', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Early Intervention', 'Electroencephalogram', 'Electroencephalography', 'Epidemic', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Hour', 'Human', 'Iatrogenesis', 'Injury', 'Intervention', 'Intervention Trial', 'Intracranial Hemorrhages', 'Label', 'Medical', 'Medicine', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Neurological outcome', 'Neurology', 'Nomenclature', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Periodicity', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Seizures', 'Sepsis', 'Standardization', 'Subclinical Seizures', 'Supervision', 'Telemetry', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Uremia', 'Visual', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'brain health', 'causal model', 'clinical care', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'clinically actionable', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'deep learning algorithm', 'disability', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'intervention effect', 'large datasets', 'learning strategy', 'nerve injury', 'neurophysiology', 'overtreatment', 'predictive modeling', 'preventable death', 'real time monitoring', 'tool']",NINDS,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,R01,2020,559900,-0.03167724383398037
"Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature Project Summary/Abstract Symptom-based diagnoses of mental illness are highly comorbid, biologically heterogeneous, and poorly predictive of treatment response. The National Institute of Mental Health has led efforts to redefine mental illness by its biological causes, establishing the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework as a guide for investigating variation in basic brain systems. RDoC has been influential, named in hundreds of grants and publications, but it has yet to be systematically validated. It is unknown whether circuit-function links underlying the RDoC brain systems are reproducible across studies, and organizing principles remain largely untested. While the structure of RDoC as a modular hierarchy has evidence in resting state analyses, it has not been shown whether this applies to systems that support the diverse mental states affected in psychiatric disease. It is necessary to validate RDoC, and moreover, to establish fundamental principles of organization for systems defined jointly by human brain structure and function. The objective of this proposal is to apply large- scale computational neuroimaging meta-analyses to build a data-driven ontology that will not only serve as a benchmark in evaluating the validity of RDoC but also characterize the architecture of systems for human brain function. The long-term goal is to redefine mental illness by differences from healthy function within the brain systems of a data-driven ontology, facilitating rational targeting of neuromodulation treatments. The proposed meta-analyses will be the most comprehensive in the field with 18,155 MRI and PET studies already collected. The mental functions considered in these studies have been extracted from article texts using natural language processing, and brain circuits will be mapped from the brain coordinate data that were reported. The hypothesis is that brain systems are comprised of reproducible circuit-function links organized into a modular hierarchy, which for some systems will require updates to RDoC. This will be tested by comparing RDoC systems against those of a data-driven ontology. Aim 1: The reproducibility of circuit-function links will be evaluated by the performance of neural network classifiers predicting functions in article texts from circuits in brain scan data, and vice versa. Aim 2: The modularity of brain systems will be evaluated by a graph theoretic approach, and hierarchical structure will be assessed by representational similarity analysis. The impact of this project will be to validate the foremost psychiatry research framework and to characterize human brain systems through an innovative computational strategy. Together with targeted academic training in neurobiology, the fellowship is designed to offer preparation for a career as a physician-scientist leading advances in computational psychiatry. Training will be supported by an environment that combines world-class computing resources with esteemed and engaged mentors in psychiatry, neuroscience, and computer science. Project Narrative First-line treatments routinely fail for most of the 45 million US adults living with mental illness because psychiatric diagnoses lack a biological basis, making them unreliable predictors of treatment response. The proposed project will lay the foundation for a biologically based diagnostic system in psychiatry by characterizing the composition and structure of human brain systems through innovative computational meta-analyses of nearly 20,000 neuroimaging articles. When it is understood what makes up a brain system and how systems are organized, mental illness can be redefined by variation from healthy function, facilitating successful targeting of brain-based treatments.",Computational ontology of brain systems across the human neuroimaging literature,9991669,F30MH120956,"['Academic Training', 'Adult', 'Affect', 'Base of the Brain', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Brain scan', 'Cognitive', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Emotional', 'Environment', 'Expert Opinion', 'Fellowship', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Graph', 'Higher Order Chromatin Structure', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Influentials', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Names', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Ontology', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Prediction of Response to Therapy', 'Preparation', 'Psychiatric Diagnosis', 'Psychiatry', 'Publications', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Support System', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Testing', 'Text', 'Training', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'clinically relevant', 'comorbidity', 'computer science', 'computerized tools', 'computing resources', 'deep learning', 'design', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mental function', 'mental state', 'neural network classifier', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinformatics', 'neuroregulation', 'predictive modeling', 'social', 'system architecture']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,37706,0.04965185527769154
"Diagnosis of indeterminate brain lesions using MRI-based machine learning and polygenic risk models PROJECT SUMMARY In 2017 an MRI was performed at a rate of over one for every 10 US residents. The majority of these were brain MRIs. Indeterminate mass lesions are present on over 1% of brain MRIs in individuals over 45 years old. Misinterpretation of brain MRI can lead to significant iatrogenic morbidity and mortality. For example, tumefactive Central Nervous System Inflammatory Demyelinating Disease (CNSIDD) is commonly misdiagnosed as a malignancy, even following pathological review. This results in inappropriate brain biopsies, debulking and radiation. While early tumor resection is associated with favorable outcome in patients with high- grade glioma, observation, biopsy at an alternate site or nonsurgical options are often more appropriate for other indeterminate mass lesions that can encompass low-grade primary brain tumor, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastasis. Thus, to prevent iatrogenic morbidity, there is a critical need for scalable and reproducible methods to distinguish CNSIDD from other brain lesions, and to accurately diagnose brain tumors prior to biopsy. We recently published a polygenic risk model demonstrating that the 25 known glioma germline risk variants can estimate absolute and lifetime glioma risk. The clinical significance of these models is driven by germline variants that are associated with >4-fold increased risk of glioma. We have also shown that the same 25 germline variants can predict glioma molecular subtype. As a complementary approach, we have shown that imaging characteristics differ across glioma, CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and brain metastases. We have successfully utilized MRI-based machine learning to predict the molecular subtype in high-grade glioma. We hypothesize that both germline genotyping and MRI-based machine learning provide an opportunity to diagnose indeterminate mass lesions as well as predict glioma molecular subtype prior to surgery and thus personalized treatment. The project has the following three aims: Aim 1: Develop and validate a MRI-based machine learning model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases of unknown primary. Aim 2: Evaluate sensitivity and specificity of the polygenic glioma risk model to differentiate adult diffuse glioma from tumefactive CNSIDD, CNS lymphoma and solitary brain metastases. Aim 3: Integrate the polygenic glioma subtype model and MRI-based machine learning model to predict adult diffuse glioma molecular subtype and validate the integrated model using a prospective cohort. The proposed project will further enhance the care of patients by determining if an early MRI lesion is actually a glioma. Early definitive surgery in these patients could be curative. PROJECT NARRATIVE Indeterminate mass lesions are present on over 1% of brain MRIs in individuals over 45 years old, and misinterpretation of brain MRI can lead to significant iatrogenic morbidity and mortality.

"Distributional reinforcement learning in the brain. Project Summary The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has recently made remarkable advances that resulted in new and improved algorithms and network architectures that proved efficient empirically in silico. These advances raise new questions in neurobiology: are these new algorithms used in the brain? The present study focuses on a new algorithm developed in the field of reinforcement learning (RL), called distributional RL, which outperforms other state-of-the-art RL algorithms and is regarded as a major advancement in RL. In environments in which rewards are probabilistic with respect to its occurrence and size, traditional RL algorithms have focused on learning to predict a single quantity, the average over all potential rewards. Distributional RL, by contrast, learns to predict the entire distribution over rewards (or values) by employing multiple value predictors that together encode all possible levels of future reward concurrently. Remarkably, theoretical work has shown that a class of distributional RL, called ‘quantile distributional RL’, can arise out of a simple modification of traditional RL that introduces structured variability in dopamine reward prediction error (RPE) signals. This project set out to test the hypothesis that the brain utilizes distributional RL to predict future rewards. Aim 1 will explore the characteristics of distributional RL theoretically and make predictions that allow for testing distributional RL in the brain. Theoretical investigations and simulations will be used to determine how value representations in distributional RL differ from pre-existing population coding schemes for representing probability distributions (probabilistic population codes, distributed distributional codes, etc.). Aim 2 will examine the activity of neurons that are thought to signal RPEs and reward expectation and test various predictions of distributional RL. Specifically, the activity of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area and neurons in the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex will be compared to key predictions of distributional RL. Aim 3 will use optogenetic manipulation to causally demonstrate the relationship between RPE signals and distributional codes.

"Crossing space and time: uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of multimodal and multiscale brain activity The brain is a complex dynamical system, with a hierarchy of spatial and temporal scales ranging from microns and milliseconds to centimeters and years. Activity at any given scale contributes to activity at the scales above it and can influence activity at smaller scales. Thus a true understanding of the brain requires the ability to understand how each level contributes to the system as a whole. Most brain research focuses on a single scale (single unit firing, activity in a circuit), which cannot account for the constraints imposed by activities at other scales. The goal of this proposal is to develop a framework for the integration of multiscalar, multimodal measurements of brain activity. One of the challenges in understanding how activity translates across scales is that features that are relevant at one scale (e.g., firing rate) do not have clear analogues at other scales. We address this issue by defining trajectories in “state space” at each scale, where the state space is defined by parameters and time scales appropriate to each type of data. The trajectory of brain activity through state space can uncover features like attractor dynamics and limit cycles that characterize the evolution of activity. Using machine learning along with new and existing multimodal measurements of brain activity (MRI, optical, and electrophysiological), we propose to establish methods that relate trajectories across scales while handling the mismatch in temporal sampling rates inherent in multi-scale data. Specific aims are 1. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at fast scales influence activity at slower scales. Different modalities have different inherent temporal resolutions in addition to different types of contrast. Current methods generally downsample the faster modality in some way, losing much information in the process. We will leverage variants on long short-term memory (LSTM) network architectures to learn the relationship between state space trajectories acquired simultaneously with population recording and optical imaging, and with optical imaging and fMRI. 2. Create and test a tool for learning how trajectories at slow scales influence activity at faster scales. Leveraging the same LSTM-based approach, we will learn how slower, larger scale activity affects activity at smaller scales, using whisker stimulation as a test case. We anticipate inclusion of the large scale activity (measured with fMRI or optical imaging) will improve prediction of the response at smaller scales (measured with optical imaging or population recording). Our work will allow us to begin to answer a wide range of questions about how the brain functions (e.g., what type of localized stimulation that will drive the brain to a desired global state? How does modulation of the global brain state affect local information processing?) and provide guidance for future experiments by identifying key features that influence activity across scales. By approaching the whole brain as a complex dynamical system, we will break free from the limitations of previous studies that focus on individual cells or circuits. We also expect our work to stimulate new theories that incorporate multiple scales of activity. The brain is a complex, dynamical system that exhibits structured activity at many different space and time scales. Most existing studies focus on a single scale (for example, spiking of individual neurons or activity in a particular circuit).

"Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis Abstract: Metastasis from the primary tumor site to the brain is the most lethal complication of cancer progression and is experienced by approximately 20% of breast cancer patients worldwide. There is at present no translational approach to detect if a primary tumor has brain metastatic potential, no markers that predict successful future metastasis, and thus no therapies to target any of the processes involved. These gaps are difficult to bridge due to a lack of technology that can classify a cancer cell’s brain metastatic potential. Current in vivo murine models are slow to manifest metastasis and do not have the capability of capturing single cell morphology and dynamics; therefore, we propose a diagnostic platform to measure the phenotypic differences between cancer cells and to assign them a brain metastatic potential. The output is a quantitative diagnostic read out that defines the probability of a patient's cell metastasizing to the brain. Preliminary data suggests we may use this platform to brain metastatic behavior in 24-72 hrs. We have demonstrated that we can classify non-brain seeking and brain seeking cell lines based on phenotypic metrics such as migration, extravasation, shape and volume with a positive predictive value of 0.9. This study will validate the performance of this platform on patient cells. Further we aim to understand what components of the brain stromal space promote brain metastasis to further improve the performance of this technology and identify candidates that could be targeted by therapeutics to prevent metastasis in patients that have been identified as at risk. In summary, we propose a unique approach to measure the individual metastatic potential of tumor cells spatially and temporally. This work will result in both improved clinical stratification and, downstream from it, in a more robust set of targetable pathways for prevention of brain metastasis from breast and other primary sites. Public health narrative: This grant would help develop a new clinical approach to predicting the progression of primary cancer into brain metastasis. This is the most lethal complication of breast cancer. Preventing this would save lives and improve quality of life for thousands of patients every year.",Artificial Intelligence driven prediction of brain metastasis from primary tumor sites at diagnosis,9878354,R21CA245597,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Blood - brain barrier anatomy', 'Brain', 'Breast Cancer Patient', 'Breast cancer metastasis', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Cancer cell line', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Cellular Morphology', 'Clinical', 'Clinical stratification', 'Complication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Discipline', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Extravasation', 'Funding Opportunities', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Image', 'In Vitro', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Measures', 'Metastatic malignant neoplasm to brain', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microfluidics', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Target', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms', 'Output', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Penetration', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Predictive Value', 'Prevention', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Three-dimensional analysis', 'Tissues', 'Tumor-Derived', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'cancer cell', 'cancer complication', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer type', 'clinically relevant', 'design', 'experience', 'histological slides', 'human tissue', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'learning classifier', 'machine learning algorithm', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'migration', 'mouse model', 'neoplastic cell', 'operation', 'organ on a chip', 'pathology imaging', 'phenotypic biomarker', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'prototype', 'success', 'targeted treatment', 'tomography', 'translational approach', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R21,2020,218790,-0.01527532489719317
"Open-source software for multi-scale mapping of the human brain Project Summary (maximum 30 lines) The BRAIN initiative seeks to develop and apply technologies in order to understand of how brain cells interact in both time and space to give rise to brain function. A key deliverable in BRAIN is a systematic census of neuronal and glial cell types, which is a prerequisite to understand how these cells interact and change in healthy aging and in disease. Moreover, such a census will provide a common reference cell taxonomy, which is crucial to harmonize studies at different sites and achieve the goals of BRAIN.  A necessary companion of the census is a reference coordinate system, which enables us to understand the spatio-anatomical context in which cells interact, as well as their connectivity. Building such a coordinate system requires advanced spatial alignment (registration) tools, since virtually every lab technique used in microscopic brain cell phenotyping – particularly in human brain – requires blocking and/or sectioning of samples, hence distorting the structure of tissue. Due to the difficulty of providing support for datasets and acquisition setups different to the original, most publicly available techniques to recover the lost tissue structure (“3D reconstruction”) rely on very simple techniques, such as vanilla pairwise registration of neighboring sections. Moreover, conventional reconstruction methods are notoriously slow, and no available method is designed to 3D reconstruct whole human brains.  In this interdisciplinary project, which lies at the nexus of computer science, MRI physics, histology, optical imaging, anatomy and statistics, we propose to extend, robustify, test, distribute and support our recently developed, state-or-the-art techniques that will enable the constructions of a coordinate system capable of representing multi-scale maps of human brain anatomy and function. This includes algorithms and software for: image analysis of ex vivo MRI; construction of laminar models of the human cerebral cortex; 3D reconstruction of microscopic images and alignment to the laminar models; surface based analysis of microscopy data on the laminar structure; and alignment of ex vivo and in vivo images to accurately transfer information from microscopy to MRI studies of the living brain, in health and in disease.  The tools we propose to build and disseminate will combine modern deep learning techniques with principled Bayesian inference, and have the potential to deliver accurate registration at the macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic level, with high throughput delivered using cutting-edge machine learning algorithms. Effective dissemination of these tools, along with companion test data, will be achieved through our widespread package FreeSurfer. The distributed tools will not only enable the construction of a cell census with rich spatial information at human brain scale (including a novel laminar model), but will also have a tremendous impact in other areas of neuroimaging, including overarching goals of BRAIN such as: linking cellular-level activity to functional MRI, atlas building, or connecting axonal anatomy to diffusion MRI. Project narrative (maximum 3 sentences) In this project, we seek resources to develop, integrate, distribute and support a set of tools for the automated spatial mapping of in vivo (MRI, PET, etc…) and ex vivo (microscopy) imaging modalities, which can be used to enhance the BRAIN cell census with a coordinate system for representing maps of human brain function and anatomy at multiple scales – including laminar models of the cerebral cortex that have been long desired by the neuroimaging community. The tools will include algorithms for segmentation of ex vivo MRI; laminar modeling; registration of microscopic images to MRI; and analysis of histological data on spherical coordinate systems of the cortex. These tools will not only enable the scientific community to include spatial information into the cell census, but will also have a dramatic impact on other neuroimaging projects related to the BRAIN initiative in terms of their ability to share and compare data in a unified coordinate system and use the results of BRAIN research to make inferences in studies of living human beings.",Open-source software for multi-scale mapping of the human brain,10008355,RF1MH123195,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Axon', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Stem', 'Cells', 'Censuses', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cerebrum', 'Communities', 'Companions', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Fiber', 'Freezing', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Gap Junctions', 'Genus Vanilla', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Institutes', 'Iron', 'Licensing', 'Link', 'Location', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maintenance', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Microscopic', 'Microscopy', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Noise', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Property', 'Protocols documentation', 'Protons', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Secure', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'Taxonomy', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'computer science', 'contrast imaging', 'data sharing', 'data tools', 'deep learning', 'design', 'healthy aging', 'heterogenous data', 'human data', 'image reconstruction', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microscopic imaging', 'morphometry', 'multidisciplinary', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open source', 'optical imaging', 'reconstruction', 'sample fixation', 'segmentation algorithm', 'skills', 'statistics', 'stem', 'tool', 'virtual']",NIMH,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,RF1,2020,558806,0.037265569062403324

"Learning high-dimensional functional connectomes of heterogeneous populations PROJECT SUMMARY Network analysis of brain connectivity, or Connectomics, has emerged as an important interdisciplinary field, making strides in advancing both fundamental scientific knowledge on the structure of the brain, as well as providing insights into the pathology of neurological disorders. Advances in neuroimaging technologies have enabled acquisition of high-resolution datasets on brain activities in normal and diseased populations, while advanced machine learning methods hold promise to obtain data-driven insights into the functional architecture of the brain. Functional connectivity analysis is typically carried out in two steps. First, one estimates a network among different brain regions by studying strengths of associations among the time course of neurophysiological signals for different subjects (patients or healthy controls). Next, one compares the networks between different groups of subjects and seeks network features prevalent in specific groups of interest using statistical methods. Two emerging challenges in this field are the presence of heterogeneity amongst subjects in large study cohorts, and developing predictive models to construct robust and interpretable results. The central goal of this proposal is to address these challenges by developing machine learning methods equipped with uncertainty quantification measures, suitable for high-dimensional network data for heterogeneous populations. Upon completion, these methods are expected to provide automated, robust and more accurate discovery of connectivity patterns that is prevalent in heterogeneous populations of patients. We aim to accomplish this goal by pursuing two specific aims: (1) develop estimation and inference methods for frequency domain measures of high-dimensional functional connectivity networks, (2) develop a framework of mixed effects model of high-dimensional functional connectivity networks that accounts for heterogeneity among subjects and enables discoveries more likely to generalize in large cohorts. For each aim, novel machine learning methods for integrative analysis of structural and functional connectivity will be developed using a mathematical model of network diffusion. We will also calibrate and validate our proposed methods on data from Human Connectome Project, and on multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The proposed approach is innovative since it integrates machinery across diverse disciplines, including statistics, machine learning and network analysis to address important challenges learning large functional connectivity graphs. The proposed research is significant in that it is expected to have both scientific and translational impact. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because understanding brain connectivity patterns using rigorous machine learning methods can help seek common patterns in large databases in an automated fashion, and can potentially lead to development of neuroimaging based diagnostic tools and sensitive prognostic measures. The proposed research will thus use fundamental scientific knowledge about brain to assist translational research in neurological disease.",Learning high-dimensional functional connectomes of heterogeneous populations,10110789,R21NS120227,"['Address', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cations', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cerebral cortex', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Estrogen receptor positive', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Interest Group', 'Knowledge', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Neurologic', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Series', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Models', 'Structure', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Translational Research', 'Uncertainty', 'Visualization', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'brain size', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive process', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'data integration', 'experience', 'help-seeking behavior', 'heterogenous data', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'individual patient', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning network', 'machine learning method', 'mathematical model', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple sclerosis patient', 'nervous system disorder', 'network models', 'neuroimaging', 'neurological pathology', 'neuropathology', 'neurophysiology', 'novel', 'open source', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'skills', 'statistics', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'white matter']",NINDS,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R21,2020,428417,0.029840377380387854
"Advancing Secondary Data Analysis: the ENIGMA Brain Injury Data Harmonization Initiative Project Summary/Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health issue globally, and while neuroimaging has been useful in understanding disruption in brain structure and function after injury, there are a number of factors that attenuate its prognostic ability. For example, there is tremendous heterogeneity in outcome after injury which is only partially explained by injury severity. Cost frequently limits sample size in neuroimaging studies, yet given the myriad factors that have been shown to influence patient outcome (age, injury severity, socioeconomic status), small samples and mass univariate testing often result in many studies being grossly under-powered. One solution is to combine data and create novel data sharing platforms, and the Enhancing Neuroimaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) consortium has supported this kind of collaboration for over a decade across a range of clinical disorders. The goal of this proposal is to develop tools and data processing procedures for use in the ENIGMA Brain Injury working group. In the R61 phase, we aim to develop and test a workflow for harmonized processing of behavioral data (Aim 1) as well as structural and functional (resting-state) MRI data (Aim 2). For Aim 1 of the R61, the goal is to offer a decision tree of procedures that is data-dependent, allowing investigators to establish common cognitive endpoints across cohorts that collect a range of neuropsychological and clinical measures. This proposal will create sharable procedures, flexible tools, and generalizable guidelines for best practices for extracting common cognitive endpoints from distinct behavioral test batteries (R61 Aim 1). In Aim 2 of the R61, we develop an image processing pipeline called Harmonization and Aggregation for Functional and structural imaging data PIPEline; HAF-PIPE) that allows for aggregation of non-equivalent imaging data. A primary goal is to decentralize ComBat, an open-source data harmonization tool, so that it can be used in a virtual sharing environment. Following satisfaction of the R61 Go/No-Go criteria, which is the curation of the dataset including 13 cohorts, extraction of common cognitive endpoints, and creation of HAF- PIPE, we will move to the R33 phase. In the R33 phase, we will leverage the large, harmonized dataset and apply a machine learning technique (CorEx - Correlation Explanation) to identify patient clusters within each patient population studied. HAF-PIPE and the procedures and guidelines from the R61 phase will then be extended to additional patient populations and made available to other ENIGMA working groups. The harmonized data, along with the tools and procedures for creating them, will be accessible to researchers following proposal submission and approval as a curated dataset. With success, this proposal holds the promise of significantly advancing data curation, harmonization, and sharing in the clinical neurosciences. We anticipate that our proposal will significantly advance our understanding of factors that impact outcome after injury and will yield a tool that will be useful across the neuroimaging community. Project Narrative Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can cause widespread alteration in brain structure and function, but sample size in imaging studies is often limited, and differences in data acquisition and variables can create obstacles to data sharing. We propose to develop an open-source workflow for utilizing behavioral and MRI data that addresses these concerns and allows for harmonization across sites, supporting “big data” analyses that can identify clinically-meaningful patient subgroups in TBI, a goal that is not feasible with small datasets. Achieving the proposed Aims will make a curated and harmonized dataset available to the TBI community as well as procedures and data processing pipelines adaptable to other disorders in the clinical neurosciences.",Advancing Secondary Data Analysis: the ENIGMA Brain Injury Data Harmonization Initiative,10129715,R61NS120249,"['Address', 'Age', 'Archives', 'Attenuated', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain Injuries', 'Calibration', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Decentralization', 'Decision Trees', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Heterogeneity', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'Injury', 'International', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Modeling', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neuropsychology', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Patient Self-Report', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Population Study', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Severities', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Standardization', 'Stream', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Validation', 'base', 'behavior test', 'behavioral construct', 'clinical heterogeneity', 'cohort', 'collaborative environment', 'combat', 'computerized data processing', 'cost', 'data acquisition', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data curation', 'data harmonization', 'data ingestion', 'data pipeline', 'data quality', 'data sharing', 'design', 'flexibility', 'heterogenous data', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'insight', 'multimodal data', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'patient population', 'patient subsets', 'portability', 'prognostic value', 'response', 'satisfaction', 'sharing platform', 'stroke recovery', 'success', 'tool', 'virtual', 'virtual environment', 'working group']",NINDS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R61,2020,1015434,0.02303703528256312
"Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system Abstract Numerous small vessels making up the central nervous system blood and lymphatic vascular networks are heterogeneous and region-specific dynamic structures, whose segments, position, shape and function can change in response to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. To date it has not been possible to integrate blood and lymphatic vascular elements and their microenvironment to achieve a holistic quantitative characterization of the combined brain and meningeal tissue-scale vascular networks, its structure and function in normal and disease states. This application proposes to develop microscopy- based high-throughput image analysis techniques for automated extraction of blood and lymphatic vascular networks enabling quantitative morphodynamic characterization of cerebrovascular microenvironment changes in two intracranial compartments – the brain and dura mater. The study will focus on new algorithms for precise region-specific microvessel registration, mosaicing, segmentation, fusion and colocalization for constructing large tissue scale spatially aligned dual blood/lymphatic vascular network structural maps in the animals of both sexes, as well as characterization of heterogeneities of microvascular networks, including blood and lymphatic vasculature, under estrogen and sleep deprivation (the conditions relevant to multiple cerebrovascular disorders) compared to physiological settings. In other words, advanced microscopy-based techniques will be used to image blood and lymphatic vessels at sub-micron resolution in dura mater and the brain, and then cutting-edge deep machine learning imaging analysis methods will be employed to segment and quantify these vessels, their geometry, vessel wall structure, functionality, and interrelationship. Detailed structural analysis of microvascular networks is essential for accurate evaluation of the distribution of physical forces, substrate delivery and tissue clearance of waste, as well as sex differences and consequences of intracranial networks remodeling under physiological and pathological conditions. This will create knowledge enabling a better understanding of the pathogenesis of vascular impairments under estrogen and sleep deprivation, identify common molecular mechanisms and the efficacy and effectiveness of different therapeutic treatments. Without the ability to construct total structural and functional blood/lymphatic vascular network maps from studies limited to individual tissue component parts, it is little wonder that translation from the molecular and cellular levels to the whole organ and system levels is deficient and hinders translational progress towards a comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology associated with a range of neurological disorders. Detailed analysis of structural relationships of both blood and lymphatic circulation in the brain system will have a direct impact on our general understanding of vascular function in brain/meningeal communication, and the cause and resolution of numerous diseases resulting from intracranial vascular disorders including impact of sex hormone (estrogen) deprivation, sleep deprivation, migraines, stroke, multiple sclerosis, dural arterio-venous fistulae, intradural hygroma and hematoma, spontaneous cerebral spinal fluid leaks, and intradural aneurysms that can lead to the development of neurological and cognitive impairment, including Alzheimer's. Quantitative description of blood and lymphatic vessel network structures using image analytics and machine learning algorithms distributed as software tools will have broad applications to quantification of other thin complex curvilinear anatomical structures (i.e. nerves, neuronal circuits, neurons, and neuroglia). The new software for blood and vessel network measurement will enable translation of fundamental pathophysiological knowledge gained from this proposal towards the development and assessment of the effectiveness of treatments and therapeutic interventions to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability associated with a range of neurological disorders.",Quantitative analysis of estrogen and sleep deprivation-induced blood and lymphatic vascular remodeling in the brain system,9914136,R01NS110915,"['Acute', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Anatomy', 'Aneurysm', 'Animals', 'Arteriovenous fistula', 'Blood', 'Blood Circulation', 'Blood Vessels', 'Blood capillaries', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cephalic', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Insomnia', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Cystic Lymphangioma', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dura Mater', 'Dural Arteriovenous Fistulas', 'Effectiveness', 'Elements', 'Estrogens', 'Evaluation', 'Female', 'Functional disorder', 'Geometry', 'Gonadal Steroid Hormones', 'Health', 'Hematoma', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impaired cognition', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lymphatic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Meningeal', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Mosaicism', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Mus', 'Nerve', 'Neuraxis', 'Neuroglia', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Optical Coherence Tomography', 'Parietal', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathologic', 'Pathway interactions', 'Physiological', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Resolution', 'Route', 'Sex Differences', 'Shapes', 'Site', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Sleep Disorders', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Software Tools', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Subdural Hematoma', 'Subdural Hygroma', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Thinness', 'Tissues', 'Translations', 'Treatment Effectiveness', 'Vascular Diseases', 'Vascular remodeling', 'Vascular resistance', 'Venous', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'body system', 'cerebral microvasculature', 'cerebrovascular', 'clinically relevant', 'confocal imaging', 'deep learning', 'deprivation', 'disability', 'geometric structure', 'in vivo', 'lymphatic circulation', 'lymphatic vasculature', 'lymphatic vessel', 'machine learning algorithm', 'male', 'microleakage', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuronal circuitry', 'noninvasive diagnosis', 'novel', 'response', 'sex', 'sleep pattern', 'solute', 'stem', 'submicron', 'tool', 'wasting']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI-COLUMBIA,R01,2020,540520,0.01855578331270603
"Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Continued Development of Infant Brain Analysis Tools Abstract: The increasing availability of infant brain MR images, such as those that will be collected through the Baby Connectome Project (BCP, on which Dr. Shen is a Co-PI, focusing on data acquisition), affords unprecedented opportunities for precise charting of dynamic early brain developmental trajectories in understanding normative and aberrant growth. However, to fully benefit from these datasets, a major barrier that needs to be overcome is the critical lacking of computational tools for accurate processing and analysis of infant MRI data, which typically exhibit poor tissue contrast, large within tissue intensity variation, and regionally-heterogeneous and dynamic changes. To fill this critical gap, in 2012 we pioneered in creating an infant-centric MRI processing software package, called infant Brain Extraction and Analysis Tool (iBEAT), and a set of infant-specific atlases, called UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases, and further made them freely and publicly available via NITRC. Over the last 4 years, iBEAT and UNC 0-1-2 Infant Atlases have been downloaded 2900+ and 5600+ times, respectively, and contributed to 160+ independent research papers. As indicated by 30+ support letters, iBEAT is now driving the research for MRI studies of early brain development in many labs throughout the world. Results produced by iBEAT are also highlighted in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)'s 2015-2020 Strategic Plan. This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT, by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. To achieve this goal, we propose four aims. In Aim 1, we will create an innovative learning-based multi-source information integration framework for joint skull stripping and tissue segmentation for accurate structural measurements. Our method employs random forest to adaptively learn the optimal image appearance features from multimodality images and also informative context features from tissue probability maps. In Aim 2, we will construct longitudinal infant brain atlases at multiple time points (i.e., 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months of age) for both T1-/T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted MR images. We propose a longitudinally-consistent sparse representation technique to construct representative atlases with significantly improved structural details by explicitly dealing with possible misalignments between images even after registration. In Aim 3, we will develop a novel learning-based approach for cortical topology correction and integrate it, along with our infant-centric analysis tools and atlases for cortical surfaces, into iBEAT for precise mapping of dynamic and complex cortical changes in infants. Unlike existing tools that perform poorly for infant brains, we will incorporate infant-dedicated tools for topology correction, surface reconstruction, registration, parcellation, and measurements. We will further integrate longitudinal infant cortical surface atlases equipped with parcellations based on growth trajectories. In Aim 4, we will significantly enhance iBEAT in terms of its software functionalities as well as user support via systematic outreach and training. Finally, we will employ iBEAT to process all imaging data from BCP and will release both the iBEAT software package and the processed BCP data to the public via NITRC. Project Narrative This project is dedicated to the continuous development, hardening, and dissemination of iBEAT by developing innovative software modules with comprehensive user support. In particular, we propose four aims: 1) Learning-Based Brain Segmentation; 2) Infant Brain Atlases in the First Year of Life; 3) Cortical Surface-Based Analysis; and 4) Enhancing User Experience and Training.

"A nanomagnetic platform technology to characterize traumatic brain injury using brain derived extracellular vesicles In the United States, 2.8 million people every year seek medical attention for traumatic brain injury (TBI), of which 80% are considered to have a mild TBI (i.e. concussion). Even in those with mild injuries, 10-20% of individuals will suffer long-term disability including seizures and emotional and behavioral issues. One of the primary challenges in TBI care is appropriately classifying this heterogeneous injury and identifying patients at risk for these chronic impairments. Conventional imaging studies, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT), are commonly used to classify TBI, but do not reliably capture the full extent of the injury, particularly in those patients with mild injuries. Currently, there are few molecular markers to assist in the assessment of an individual's unique injury and subsequent recovery and biomarkers are desperately needed in the field that correlate with these varied endophenotypes, track the progress of the disease, and predict clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we propose to develop a microchip-based platform that can be used to characterize TBI and its recovery using the RNA cargo found in brain-derived circulating extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes. Unlike prior work that has mainly focused on single biomarkers, our approach measures a panel of circulating EV miRNA markers processed with machine learning algorithms, to more comprehensively capture the state of the injured and recovering brain. Our proposal combines surface marker-specific nanomagnetic isolation of brain-derived EVs from a variety of cell types, biomarker discovery using RNA sequencing, and machine learning processing of EV miRNA cargo to measure the state of injury and recovery in TBI. Nanoscale exosomes are known to shed from brain cells into the blood stream, carrying with them the molecular signatures that can be used to better diagnose and treat injuries, such as traumatic brain injury. We propose an innovative, clinically practical approach to probe the RNA contained within these nanoscale vesicles to better understand a patient's injury and recovery to better guide treatment.

"ClearScope Combined in vivo and ex vivo three-dimensional (3D) whole-brain imaging of non-transgenic and transgenic animal models holds the promise of novel insights into neural network connectivity patterns. With regard to ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole-brain datasets, the best approach is brain clearing followed by whole-brain light sheet microscopy (LSM) because of its unique combination of speed, 3D resolving power, and low phototoxicity compared to confocal and multiphoton microscopy. Unlike other methods, the combined brain clearing / LSM approach makes it possible to use intact tissue and retain all intracellular connections within the brain structure. However, LSM systems commercially available are not suitable for ex vivo light microscopic imaging of 3D whole-brain datasets in advanced connectomics research. Recently, Dr. Raju Tomer (Dept. Biol. Sci., Columbia Univ., New York, NY) developed light sheet theta microscopy (LSTM), essentially a unique arrangement of two light sheets oblique to the specimen and one detection objective perpendicular to the specimen. This novel microscope is the basis for a number of capabilities in LSTM that are not all available with any other commercially available LSM systems. The LSTM technology has distinct advantages over confocal and other light sheet microscopes, including the unmatched ability to image thicker tissue specimens over a larger lateral area (XY) at higher optical resolutions, while maintaining fast imaging speed, high imaging quality, and low photo-bleaching. This promising technology serves as the basis for this Lab to Marketplace proposal to develop the ClearScope™, which refines and improves Dr. Tomer's original LSTM system to create a successful commercial microscope for wide-spread adoption. The key technical objectives for developing the ClearScope as a commercial product include creating and testing (i) a ClearScope prototype based on an optimized microscope hardware design; (ii) novel microscope hardware components for the ClearScope, comprising a novel chamber that contains the investigated specimen and the immersion medium, and a novel detection objective changer; (iii) novel control and image acquisition software for the ClearScope; and importantly, (iv) novel software that surpasses the existing state-of-the-art technology to assemble acquired image stacks into large 3D image volumes exceeding 10TB without need to downsample the image information. The production version of the ClearScope will benefit the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general by improving understanding of neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions. In particular, this will result in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases. The proposed project will enable important new research, that is not currently feasible, into whole-brain neural network connectivity patterns by means of ex vivo light microscopic imaging of three-dimensional whole-brain datasets. To achieve this, the proposed project will create the ClearScope light sheet microscope featuring signficant capabilities to image thick specimens of unlimited lateral (XY) size with resolution that permits investigatons of subcellular structures to distinguish adjacent neuronal processes (axons, dendrites, varicosities and dendritic spines). Because these features are not all available with any commercially available light sheet microscopes, the benefit for the neuroscience research community, pharmacological and biotechnological R&D, and society in general will be the possibility to better understand neural network connectivity patterns as well as the neuropathological underpinnings of the large-scale connectional alterations associated with human neuropsychiatric and neurological conditions, ultimately resulting in an improved basis for developing novel treatment strategies for complex brain diseases.",ClearScope,10019728,R44MH116827,"['3-Dimensional', 'Address', 'Adoption', 'Animal Model', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Behavioral Research', 'Benchmarking', 'Biotechnology', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Collaborations', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Confocal Microscopy', 'Data Set', 'Dendrites', 'Dendritic Spines', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Human', 'Image', 'Immersion', 'Lateral', 'Legal patent', 'Light', 'Lighting', 'Literature', 'Methods', 'Michigan', 'Microscope', 'Microscopy', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurologic', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences Research', 'New York', 'Optics', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Pharmacology', 'Phase', 'Photobleaching', 'Phototoxicity', 'Preparation', 'Process', 'Production', 'Rattus', 'Refractive Indices', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Societies', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subcellular structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Three-Dimensional Image', 'Tissues', 'Transgenic Animals', 'Translations', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Varicosity', 'base', 'brain research', 'design', 'ex vivo imaging', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'microscopic imaging', 'multiphoton microscopy', 'neural network', 'neuropsychiatry', 'new technology', 'nonhuman primate', 'novel', 'prototype', 'research and development', 'tool', 'treatment strategy', 'usability', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,"MICROBRIGHTFIELD, LLC",R44,2020,1313060,0.02662937996184
"Exploring the neural substrates of age-related cognitive decline in patients with knee osteoarthritis Abstract Both aging and chronic pain have a pronounced impact on the brain. Thus, the interplay of chronic pain, aging, and the brain may provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive decline and dementia. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disorder among the elderly population. Two recent studies with large sample sizes found that that knee OA was associated with a significantly increased risk for dementia. Nevertheless, why knee OA is associated with high dementia risk remains unknown. Taking advantage of the NCCIH / NIH funded project (R33 AT009310) on brain mechanisms of acupuncture and imagined acupuncture treatment of knee OA, this ancillary application will allow us to expand our research on cognitive decline in patients with knee OA. Specifically, with the support of new funding, we will 1) add a cohort of heathy controls (50 age- and gender-matched controls without knee OA), 2) collect blood samples to assess inflammation markers, and 3) add cognitive measurements, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), to assess the cognitive function of both knee OA patients and controls. With newly collected data, we will combine machine learning methods and multimodality neuroimaging techniques to 1) calculate neuroimaging-based ‘brain age’ and compare the predicted age difference (PAD, difference between brain age and chronological age) between the knee OA patients and matched controls; 2) investigate the inflammation markers and brain structure and function (on cognition-related brain areas/networks) differences between the knee OA patients and controls; and 3) explore the association between inflammation markers, PAD, brain function and structure, and cognitive function as determined by MoCA score, as well as the modulation effect of alternative treatments on the above measurements. Relevance to Alzheimer’s disease and/or its Related to Dementia and  Narrative The aim of this ancillary application is to collect additional data to investigate the interplay between knee osteoarthritis, cognitive decline, and the brain.

"Automatic Control of Propanidid and Propofol Anesthesia-Induced Unconsciousness Project Summary/Abstract Current clinical practice of anesthesiology involves administering anesthetics using standard dosing guidelines, monitoring physiological responses during administration, and adjusting the dose depending on the patient responses. Importantly, direct monitoring of the brain is not part of standard anesthesiology practice, despite the desired effect taking place in the brain. In cases where the brain is directly monitored, proprietary, drug-independent, non-personalized depth of unconsciousness indices are commonly used to infer conscious state from electroencephalography (EEG) signals. This may result in overdosing, as there are significant inter-individual differences in neurological response to identical doses of anesthetics and signatures of anesthesia vary significantly with age or with choice of anesthetic. Consequently, older patients are often given more anesthetic than necessary and are at high risk for developing post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) and delirium, which may last up to several months. The prevalence of surgical procedures on older patients will rise as the population ages, necessitating new approaches for ensuring safe, personalized delivery of anesthetics that ensure unconsciousness, but also safety and return to normal cognitive function following surgery. This project seeks to develop closed-loop control of general anesthesia in humans as a means of personalizing anesthesia care. Aim 1 of this project seeks to use machine learning to develop a drug- specific marker of depth of unconsciousness that reflects the varying signatures of unconsciousness with age and may be understood clinically in terms of brain function. Aim 2 of this project is to develop models and nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) algorithms for regulating depth of unconsciousness during general anesthesia. MPC is a control scheme that may be easily modified to incorporate clinical safety features and has been used extensively in medical control systems. To tightly regulate depth of unconsciousness, fast actuation by the anesthetic is critical. Aim 3 of this project seeks to characterize the effect of propanidid, a fast-acting anesthetic currently used in clinical practice in Mexico. The culmination of Aim 2 will result in designing clinical trials for the first closed- loop anesthetic control and the culmination of Aim 3 will result in designing a clinical pharmacokinetic study of propanidid. The results of this project have the potential to transform clinical practice of anesthesia and allow individualized anesthesia care. By direct EEG monitoring and control of brain state rather than secondary markers, the personalized treatment developed by this project should help reduce overdosing of senior surgical patients and reduce incidence of POCD and delirium. Project Narrative The proposed work will develop algorithms for monitoring and regulating depth of unconsciousness during general anesthesia, with an emphasis on understanding how neural signatures of unconsciousness change as the brain ages. This project will also characterize the effects of propanidid, a fast-acting anesthetic ideal for use in a control system. The results of this research will improve our ability to tightly regulate depth of unconsciousness through automation and reduce the incidence of anesthetic overdosing and postoperative delirium through personalized medicine.",Automatic Control of Propanidid and Propofol Anesthesia-Induced Unconsciousness,10083163,F32AG064886,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Anaphylaxis', 'Anesthesia procedures', 'Anesthesiology', 'Anesthetics', 'Artificial Pancreas', 'Automation', 'Awareness', 'Brain', 'Caring', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Clinical Trials Design', 'Conscious', 'Data', 'Delirium', 'Dependence', 'Depressed mood', 'Dose', 'Drug Kinetics', 'Electroencephalography', 'Ensure', 'Future', 'General Anesthesia', 'Guidelines', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual Differences', 'Infusion procedures', 'Machine Learning', 'Maintenance', 'Medical', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Mexico', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Neurologic', 'Nociception', 'Noise', 'Non-linear Models', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Overdose', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Property', 'Propofol', 'Recovery', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Route', 'Safety', 'Scheme', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Unconscious State', 'Update', 'Work', 'clinical practice', 'clinically relevant', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive recovery', 'design', 'hands-on learning', 'high risk', 'improved', 'indexing', 'mind control', 'model design', 'novel strategies', 'older patient', 'patient response', 'personalized medicine', 'post-operative cognitive dysfunction', 'postoperative delirium', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'receptor', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensor', 'unsupervised learning']",NIA,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,F32,2020,68010,-4.018709672295971e-05
"Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST) Imaging in Cognitive Aging Healthy older adults (HOA) confront complex and life-changing decisions in the face of declining neural resources. Changes in aged brains include shrinkage of neurons and their projections in several areas, such as the neocortex, hippocampus and substantia nigra.1 These age-related structural brain changes, typically measured using in vivo techniques (e.g. MRI), reflect cellular changes. Glutamate (Glu) is a key molecule in cellular metabolism, the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system, and the principal neurotransmitter of cortical efferents.2,3 Alterations in brain Glu likely contribute to the neural mechanisms underlying age-related declines in behavioral and cognitive functions.4 Yet, only a few studies4-11 have investigated age-related changes in brain Glu, in vivo, during healthy aging. Most of these have used standard techniques and as a result our understanding of the role that brain Glu has in typical and atypical aging remains limited. Here, I aim to fill significant gaps in the field, by 1) assessing brain Glu using a novel magnetization transfer technique—Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST)—on an ultra-high field 7T MRI scanner, enables the measurement of brain Glu across the cerebrum in humans.12; 2) assess cognitive performance using a highly sensitive computerized neurocognitive battery (Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB)); and 3) explore the possibility of aging biotypes based upon age- related changes in brain glutamate.  Here, we propose to investigate alterations in brain glutamate in 100 HOA (60-85 years of age) using GluCEST 7T MRI and relate alterations in brain Glu to age-related changes in cognitive functioning, including, memory, and executive function. Moreover, we will contrast age-related patterns with data from young adults (18-30 years of age). Finally, we leverage data from a large consortium, iSTAGING (directed by Co- Investigator Davatzikos), to employ recently developed machine-learning techniques (e.g. HYDRA13), to classify subgroups of older adults based upon unique patterns of brain structure associated with typical, atypical and resilient aging. These subtypes will be applied within our sample and patterns of brain glutamate can then be measured within these subtypes. The proposed studies will provide more specific and sensitive in vivo measurements of brain glutamate in HOA. This proposal will enable testing of specific hypothesis about the regional distribution of brain Glu, its relation to aging, and its contribution to cognitive functioning in aging. As such, these studies can provide crucial preliminary data for longitudinal studies in healthy and pathological aging by targeting a specific neural mechanism associated with cognition and disease progression. RELEVANCE Older adults tend to focus on positive emotional information more than their younger counterparts. The psychological and neural mechanisms of this positivity bias remain unclear and it is possible that an age-related reduction in executive function contribute to this bias. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the positivity bias is maintained in those at risk for developing dementia. This positivity and and  roject aims to characterize this emergence of this bias across the lifespan and determine its role in the early stages of dementia those at risk for developing dementia using computerized assessment of emotion cognition. p",Glutamate Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (GluCEST) Imaging in Cognitive Aging,10241606,R56AG066656,"['Affect', 'Age', 'Age-Years', 'Age-associated memory impairment', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease brain', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemicals', 'Climacteric', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive aging', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Dementia', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease Progression', 'Elderly', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Failure', 'Glutamates', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Longevity', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Metabolism', 'Neocortex', 'Nervous system structure', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurocognitive', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Participant', 'Pathology', 'Pattern', 'Personal Satisfaction', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Reaction Time', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substantia nigra structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe', 'Testing', 'Work', 'age related', 'aging brain', 'base', 'brain size', 'cerebral atrophy', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive performance', 'cognitive task', 'computerized', 'executive function', 'frontal lobe', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'neurobehavioral', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neurochemistry', 'neuroimaging', 'neuromechanism', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'pathological aging', 'psychologic', 'rapid growth', 'relating to nervous system', 'statistics', 'supervised learning', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R56,2020,532865,-0.01460500158554063
"High resolution mapping of the genetic risk for disease in the aging brain ABSTRACT Brain structure undergoes changes throughout life as part of the normal healthy aging process, yet some genetic factors embedded in our DNA are believed to alter and potentially accelerate the aging process within the brain. While numerous neuroimaging studies have aimed to map the genetics of dementia, differences in populations and approaches confounded with the small effect sizes attributable to any single genetic variant leads to inconsistencies in findings and limited resources to investigate the truth. Dozens of neuroimaging genetic studies have been collected around the world to help better understand the link. However, the independent nature by which the studies often operate may be limiting scientific advance. Instead of collecting new data to answer the same questions, we harmonize brain mapping efforts across existing studies and pool information to not only study differences between the healthy and demented brain, but also examine normal healthy aging trends, and determine the first signs of deviation, and map out the neurobiological effect of genes that confer risk for dementia. In our effort, we aim to pinpoint mechanistic trajectories and brain circuits by which the widely studied ApoE4 genetic haplotype affects brain throughout life. Despite being identified as a genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease over 20 years ago, the effects on the brain in populations around the world are remarkably inconsistent. With novel brain mapping techniques across tens of thousands of individuals across the lifespan, we will perform the most well powered brain mapping initiative and build necessary tools to invite other researchers from around the world to add confidence to the findings. We will also determine – with unprecedented power -- how the aggregate risk for AD promotes accelerated brain degeneration with novel expedited longitudinal linear mixed modeling techniques for large scale epidemiological genetic studies with repeat data. Our proposal brings together contributions from multidisciplinary collaborators with world renowned expertise in neurodegeneration, brain mapping, big data, artificial intelligence, epidemiology, genomics and epigenomes, statistical genetics, and molecular and biological psychiatry. Our technical expertise will provide resources for visualizing genetic results at the finest resolution and provide tools for researchers to use our harmonized analyses to structure their own aging hypotheses in populations of men and women around the world, and even target sex-specific hypotheses in aging. As new brain imaging and genetic data is becoming rapidly available, we provide the tools to harmonize the data into this workflow for years to come. Driven by the data sharing and reuse of this proposal, we provide a portal for researchers of today and tomorrow to access findings from all the studies incorporated in this proposal and add to the collective repository of effects. We hope our careful harmonization of data, along with novel mathematics, tools, and selection of targeted hypotheses will guide future collaborative studies for continuous reuse.

"Innovative biostatistical approaches to network level analyses of connectome-behavior relationships PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Determining the mechanisms by which the human brain generates cognition, perception, and emotion hinges upon quantifying the relationships between coordinated brain activity and behavior. NIH-funded brain mapping initiatives such as the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and the Adolescent Cognitive and Behavioral Development (ABCD) study, have accelerated the production of large brain connectivity (i.e. connectome) and behavioral datasets. Contemporary connectome research views the brain as a large-scale, complex network composed of nonadjacent, yet connected brain regions. We propose to leverage the inherent network architecture of the connectome in order to probe fundamental biological mechanisms underlying the development of executive function and internalizing symptoms. In pursuit of this research question, this application proposes to formalize and validate in house analysis pipelines into a Network Level Analysis (NLA) toolbox as a comprehensive, versatile tool for use in connectome-wide association studies. The proposed NLA toolbox fulfills BRAIN Initiative goal #5 to “Produce conceptual foundations for understanding the biological basis of mental processes through development of new theoretical and data analysis tools”. While the research focus of this career transition award is on the application of NLA to developmental mechanisms of executive function and emotion regulation, this versatile analytic tool will be transformative to connectome data analysis across species, across the lifespan, and in health and disease. As part of tool development, the applicant will validate multiple NLA approaches using in silico connectome-behavior relationships and establish sensitivity and specificity of network level findings as compared to the connectome-wide control of familywise error rate (K99 Aim 1). The applicant will then establish test-retest reliability of NLA approaches using in vivo human connectome and behavioral data available from the HCP-Young Adult cohort (N=1105), and establish brain networks underlying healthy adult executive and emotional function (K99 Aim 2). During the independent R00 phase, she will then investigate changes in connectome architecture supporting the development of executive and emotional function using the ABCD longitudinal connectome and behavioral data (N=~11,000 age 9-14) (R00 Aim 3). During the K99 phase she will extend her training in behavioral neuroscience to include training in machine learning, longitudinal models, and computer science. Building on her strong foundation in human brain connectivity analysis, the applicant will gain advanced skills in biostatistics and best practices in software development to ensure her success as an independent researcher. The advisory committee, including Drs. Smyser (functional connectivity), Marcus (software engineering), Fair (developmental neuroscience), Todorov (biostatistics), Zhang (machine learning), Bassett (connectome analysis), Eggebrecht (toolbox development), and Barch (HCP/ABCD consultant) provide expertise in all core areas spanning experimental disciplines and possess an excellent record of obtaining independent funding and mentoring young scientists. PROJECT NARRATIVE While significant research efforts have been devoted to determining the biological pathways of cognition and emotion, there is concern over the lack of reproducibility of findings. This proposal seeks to develop and apply a Network Level Analysis (NLA) toolbox which will be used to identify and characterize the brain networks underlying healthy and disordered development of executive and emotional processes. The NLA toolbox is a versatile analysis pipeline which leverages the structural and functional architecture of the brain and rigorous statistical testing and validation procedures to define brain-behavior relationships across species, across the lifespan, and in health and disease.",Innovative biostatistical approaches to network level analyses of connectome-behavior relationships,10055480,K99EB029343,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Advisory Committees', 'Age', 'Architecture', 'Area', 'Award', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biometry', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain region', 'Career Transition Award', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Endocrine', 'Ensure', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Development', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Manuals', 'Measures', 'Mental Processes', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Pathway interactions', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Production', 'Psychopathology', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Reaction Time', 'Reproducibility', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Scanning', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Engineering', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Writing', 'analysis pipeline', 'analytical method', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'brain behavior', 'cloud based', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive reappraisal', 'cohort', 'computer science', 'connectome', 'connectome data', 'dimensional analysis', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional functioning', 'executive function', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'in silico', 'in vivo', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'longitudinal dataset', 'longitudinal design', 'network architecture', 'neuroimaging', 'post intervention', 'programs', 'skills', 'skills training', 'software development', 'success', 'tool', 'tool development', 'young adult']",NIBIB,WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,K99,2020,126289,0.05169999622994866
"Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Rather than a dichotomy between health and pathology, many mental illnesses—especially depression and other mood disorders—are best conceptualized as the far end of a phenotypic spectrum, suggesting that characterizing individual differences in brain function and behavior will help further our understanding of disease. Existing work suggests that fMRI has the potential to predict individual behaviors from brain function, yet progress has been hindered by an overreliance on group studies (i.e., patients versus controls) and limited paradigms (i.e., either highly controlled tasks that risk being artificial, or at the other extreme, resting state, which is entirely unconstrained and difficult to interpret). Naturalistic fMRI, in which subjects do complex, engaging tasks such as watching films or listening to stories, offers an alternative that more closely mimics real-world cognition and may allow researchers to extract richer, more meaningful information from a single individual’s scan. As such, these paradigms are promising candidates for brain “stress tests” that would elicit patterns of brain activity that predict present or future behaviors. The specific aims of this project are: (1) to leverage existing large-scale datasets to develop methods to predict phenotypes from naturalistic fMRI data; (2) to design and conduct an fMRI study using targeted film stimuli to draw out individual variability of interest, specifically in traits related to depression; and (3) to extend the newly developed paradigms and analyses to a longitudinal study of a population at risk for depression and/or other mood disorders. Several innovative approaches to data analysis will be investigated. The central hypothesis is that brain activity evoked by these paradigms will vary across individuals in a continuous, multidimensional space that covaries with phenotype strength, that these relationships will be strong enough to predict phenotypes in unseen individuals, and that modified (e.g., attenuated) versions of patterns associated with illness will be detectable via these paradigms in those at risk before the emergence of symptoms. The long-term goal of the PI is to become an independent NIH-funded faculty member at a research-intensive university, with a research program exploring the basic cognitive neuroscience of individual differences in personality and cognition, as well as developing translational applications for psychiatry. To reach this goal, the training objectives for this award are to enhance the PI’s skills in the following areas: (1) applying machine learning techniques to predict individual-subject behavior from fMRI data; (2) conducting neuroimaging and behavioral research on depression and mood disorders with clinical and at-risk populations; and (3) gaining professional skills essential for a successful independent research career. The environment in which the career development will take place is the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Mental Health, a vibrant community with outstanding resources to support the proposed project, including relevant courses and seminars, state-of-the-art facilities for MRI data acquisition and analysis, computing power, and expertise and guidance from senior scientists in neuroscience, engineering, machine learning and psychiatry. PROJECT NARRATIVE / PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Mental illness—especially depression and other mood disorders—is a massive burden on individuals, families and societies, yet psychiatrists lack brain-based biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. This project seeks to fill that gap by conceptualizing mood disorders as the extreme end of a continuous phenotypic spectrum in the human population, and using functional brain imaging to study how individuals differ in their neural and behavioral responses to naturalistic, emotionally evocative stimuli. This project will deepen our understanding of the neurobiology of individual variability related to mood disorders, and has the potential to lead to a “stress test” for psychiatry that would help identify at-risk individuals for earlier intervention.",Linking brain activity during naturalistic tasks to individual phenotypes on the depression spectrum,10156737,R00MH120257,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anxiety', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Award', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Research', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Clip', 'Cognition', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Early Intervention', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Event', 'Face', 'Faculty', 'Family', 'Film', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Glean', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hyperactive behavior', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental Processes', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mood Disorders', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Nature', 'Neurobiology', 'Neurosciences', 'Normalcy', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Personality', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Populations at Risk', 'Property', 'Psychiatrist', 'Psychiatry', 'Research', 'Research Domain Criteria', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Senior Scientist', 'Social Environment', 'Societies', 'Stimulus', 'Stress Tests', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'anxious', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'career', 'career development', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'data acquisition', 'design', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'emotional stimulus', 'healthy volunteer', 'individual variation', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'member', 'mood symptom', 'movie', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outcome forecast', 'outcome prediction', 'programs', 'public health relevance', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'skills', 'tool', 'trait']",NIMH,DARTMOUTH COLLEGE,R00,2020,249000,0.012857103743173923
"Electrical connectomics: an innovative approach for dissecting brain mechanisms underlying behavioral states Project Summary: Understanding the mechanisms by which the brain encodes behavior presents a major challenge for developing effective therapies with which to treat neurological and psychiatric disorders. The development of brain-wide measurements of neural connectivity in mammalian models holds great potential for overcoming this challenge. Here we propose an innovative approach for collecting and integrating such data across an unprecedented number of interconnected brain regions for use in elucidating the mechanisms by which sensory processing is altered in disease. A number of neurological and psychiatric disorders are triggered or exacerbated by sensory stimuli, yet little is understood about the brain connectivity underlying such sensory hyper/hypo- sensitization. Sensory processing plays a major role in the pathology of: autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, fibromyalgia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), sensory perception disorders (SPDs), and migraine. Migraine in particular represents a compelling model of sensory hypersensitization, as the response to sensory stimuli is clear, dose- dependent, and measurable. Using state-of-the-art, multi-site in vivo recordings in a well- characterized migraine model, coupled with machine learning, we will develop network-wide electrical maps of the sensory hypersensitivity that underlies migraine. These networks will be validated for their roles in migraine using multiple behavioral assays and migraine-related pharmacological manipulations. We will additionally dissect the mechanisms underlying the sensory hypersensitivity brain state in a mouse model of migraine using optogenetic circuit manipulations as well as single-cell RNA-Seq, with the aim of identifying the contributions of specific circuits, cells, and molecules to this state. This approach is expected to substantially facilitate the use of neural oscillation-based brain networks in biomedical research, as well as provide: 1) a tool for rapid identification of a sensory hypersensitive brain state that can be tested for mechanisms shared across disorders, 2) a map of features of electrical brain networks, which serve as strong hypotheses regarding the routes whereby sensory hypersensitivity brain networks are regulated, and 3) insight into the contributions of specific cell types and molecules to the hypersensitive brain state. Collectively, this study is expected to provide insights into the etiology of migraine and other sensory hypersensitivity disorders that will be critical to developing brain network-based therapies for these diseases. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: This proposal seeks to harness a powerful approach for mapping electrical activity across the brain and to use this information to dissect the biological mechanisms underlying sensory hypersensitivity, a key aspect of many neurological and psychiatric disorders. The data collected from this study will provide a comprehensive map of electrical activity in sensory hypersensitivity in a preclinical migraine model; migraine is the most prevalent neurological disorder in the general population. These maps will then be used to identify novel brain-network based targets for the development of new therapeutics, establishing a unique approach that could be applied broadly to many brain disorders for which effective therapies remain elusive.",Electrical connectomics: an innovative approach for dissecting brain mechanisms underlying behavioral states,10001808,DP2MH126377,"['Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Behavioral Assay', 'Biological', 'Biomedical Research', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Dose', 'Etiology', 'Fibromyalgia', 'General Population', 'Hypersensitivity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Mental disorders', 'Migraine', 'Modeling', 'Network-based', 'Pathology', 'Perceptual Disorders', 'Pharmacology', 'Play', 'Public Health', 'Role', 'Route', 'Schizophrenia', 'Sensory', 'Site', 'Testing', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'cell type', 'effective therapy', 'hypersensitivity desensitization', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mouse model', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'pre-clinical', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory stimulus', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,DP2,2020,2317500,0.020390922303927257
"White Matter Connectivity and Network Analysis In a project with the investigators from the Section on Quantitative Imaging and Tissue Sciences (SQITS), NICHD and the Nervous System Development and Plasticity Section (NSDPS), NICHD we developed different models of myelin plasticity, or generally, delay plasticity in which we show how the stability of the synchronized state in the network, as well as general stability of the system, relies on having such adaptive delay. This ability is of high importance, as improper timing is implicated in many psychiatric disorders, e.g., dyslexia and szhizophrenia. The properties and consequences of having such adaptive time delays are studied for three main cases: a) where the plasticity is activity-dependent; b) where the plasticity depends on the time arrivals of the postsynaptic and presynaptic action potentials; and c) where the plasticity depends on the intermediate timing comparisons. For (a), we studied the effect of activity-dependent adaptive time delays on the stability of the system of coupled oscillators, with its implications on the stability of the oscillations and synchrony in the brain, while b) and c) are studied in terms of synchronization in the spiking neural networks where the oligodendrocytes serve as the mediators in the timing comparison. Two manuscripts describing this work are in preparation.  In 2020 I officially joined the SQITS/NICHD and participated in several of their projects. In one project that started in 2019, we are applying the machine learning framework previously developed for the study of patterns of gene expression in developing zebrafish to help with identifying regions of traumatic brain injury using a number of different MRI stains and that work has been presented at the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine Annual Meeting in Sydney, Australia (held virtually in August, 2020). In another project with double pulsed-field gradient (dPFG) MRI study we are developing techniques to measure tissue microstructure and heterogeneity within a voxel. A manuscript describing this technique has been submitted to the Scientific Reports and is in a second round of revisions, as of August 2020. Related to this, a commentary on the status of measuring dynamical properties of the extracellular space in the brain has been published in the Biophysical Journal in the Autumn of 2019.   We also continue research under the R24 BRAIN Initiative grant (""In Vivo Brain Network Latency Mapping"") in which several other principal investigators from NIH (NICHD, NINDS, and NIMH) are participated. The goal of this effort is to measure the temporal latencies (i.e., the time delays) in a human brain signaling between different regions. Being able to measure the latency information in vivo can provide a great diagnostic tool for a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Our experimental protocol consists of four different imaging modalities: diffusion MRI, providing the structural information, electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) which provides dynamic and functional information. We showed the results obtained with the novel algorithms we developed for extracting latency information from the time series data. In 2019 these algorithms are being validated using electrocorticography (ECoG) data and will be used on a newly acquired MEG time-series data, addressing situations for which the latency information between pairs of cortical regions is well known.

"Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis ABSTRACT: Psychosis commonly develops in adolescence or early adulthood. Malfunctioning neurotransmitter systems, such as glutamate, are implicated in the disease progression of psychosis. Changes in brain glutamate in psychosis likely have several sources, as such, many frontline antipsychotic medications indirectly target the glutamate system and alleviate clinical symptoms. Unfortunately, monitoring in vivo alterations of the glutamate system within the brain are spatially limited by traditional magnetic resonance techniques. But, recently a novel 7T MRI technique (GluCEST) has shown that brain glutamate levels are lower across the brain in youth on the psychosis spectrum and patients with schizophrenia as compared to typically developing youth. Here, we propose to extend this novel work to directly measure glutamate within the brain of patients at risk for developing psychosis. Thus, this proposal is motivated by the need to better understand associations of brain neurochemistry, structure and function in both normal development and during early psychosis. In this study, we seek to 1) compare measures of glutamatergic development across the cortex in a cohort of typically developing (TD) youth, those at-clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR) and individuals with frank psychosis (PSY); 2) associate changes in brain glutamate with age- and diagnosis- related structural network changes in those at risk for developing psychosis; and 3) to establish comparison data of glutamate measures at 7T MRI (1HMRS vs. GluCEST). We will recruit and follow 35 TD, CHR and PSY over the 5-year funding period. Imaging data will be acquired at 7T and analyses will leverage recent advances in network science and machine learning. We believe this innovative approach can significantly advance our understanding of the etiology of glutamate hypofunction in psychosis and provide advances to precision medicine in psychiatry. Through the proposed multi-level analysis, this innovative research will provide a substantial advance in our understanding of the neurodevelopmental substrates of psychosis. RELEVANCE: Psychosis is a debilitating psychiatric condition. Greater understanding of how abnormalities in brain development, such as disruptions in brain glutamate, during youth produce symptoms of psychosis or psychosis risk may be critical for the development of earlier and more effective treatments. This would benefit public health by reducing the great costs of psychosis to individuals and society at large.",Ultra-high field GluCEST MRI and MRS in youth at risk for psychosis,10050152,R01MH120174,"['Adolescence', 'Adolescent', 'Adolescent Behavior', 'Age', 'Anterior', 'Antipsychotic Agents', 'Area', 'Axon', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complement', 'Corpus Callosum', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease Progression', 'Dopamine', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Functional disorder', 'Funding', 'Glutamate Receptor', 'Glutamates', 'Glutamine', 'Health', 'Human', 'Image', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Learning', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Motor', 'N-Methylaspartate', 'Neurons', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Parietal Lobe', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Play', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protons', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Puberty', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Sensory', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Work', 'Youth', 'cohort', 'cost', 'effective therapy', 'emerging adult', 'frontal lobe', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid', 'high risk', 'in vivo', 'in vivo monitoring', 'innovation', 'longitudinal design', 'multilevel analysis', 'neurochemistry', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'novel imaging technique', 'precision medicine', 'recruit', 'trend', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,794181,0.039157355965698505
"Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain Great discoveries in neuroscience hold promise for reducing the burden of many of the most disabling conditions that threaten human health on a global scale, including mental illnesses and addictions. Increasingly, exceptionally innovative science inspires hope that these devastating brain-based disorders may be prevented, treated, and even cured but, as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, a suite of novel ethical challenges confronts those engaged in innovative neuroscience. These concerns include the deepest questions about what defines humanity and personhood, what forms of novel inquiry may exceed ethically acceptable limits in society, and how to perform ethically sound studies with volunteers who may be vulnerable to exploitation in the research situation. Such issues are particularly salient in mental illness and addiction research because these conditions affect cognition, emotion, motivation, behavior, and self-governance of potential participants. Importantly, some of these ethical issues are amenable to empirical study, which can yield valuable insights and evidence-informed practices that strengthen and enable ethically sound human brain investigation. The overarching goal of this proposal is thus to accelerate neuroscience toward lessening the burden of mental illness and addiction through hypothesis-driven empirical ethics inquiry in three parts. First, we determine the distinct ethical issues and problems encountered in innovative neuroscience related to mental illness and addiction through semi-structured interviews with neuroscientists, neuroethicists, and institutional review board members. Informed by our past work and grounded in a rigorous conceptual model, we examine factors both negative and positive that influence research decisionmaking by people with mental illness and addiction in the context of innovative neuroscience research, and compare their decisionmaking with that of individuals with diabetes and healthy controls. Finally, we develop a new, low-burden screening tool to tailor and enhance the safeguard of informed consent in brain research, providing investigators with a practical, actionable, and protocol-adaptable method for strengthening positive-valence factors and ameliorate negative-valence factors affecting participant decisionmaking. Maximizing our established record of expertise in empirical ethics investigations and neuroethics, this sequence of projects leverages access to the exceptional neuroscience research conducted at Stanford University, including work by BRAIN initiative investigators; provides extensive, systematically collected data on influences on decisionmaking about innovative neuroscience research participation by individuals with mental or physical illness and healthy controls; and develops a new evidence-informed tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding human volunteers in cutting-edge neuroscience. Innovative neuroscience holds extraordinary promise for improving understanding of brain disorders that threaten human health, but as the BRAIN 2025 Scientific Vision notes, new ethical questions are emerging as scientists begin to solve the mysteries of the brain. A rigorous, hypothesis-driven approach to ethical dimensions of neuroscience inquiry is needed to provide investigators, IRBs, policymakers, and the public with evidence to better enable ethical participation in brain research. We develop new knowledge and a novel tool for use as a best practice in safeguarding volunteers in innovative neuroscience research, to ensure ethical participation, enhance trust in science, and accelerate discovery.",Enabling ethical participation in innovative neuroscience on mental illness and addiction: towards a new screening tool enhancing informed consent for transformative research on the human brain,9993927,R01MH114856,"['Achievement', 'Affect', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Cell model', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognition', 'Collection', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Ecology', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Ensure', 'Ethical Issues', 'Ethics', 'Failure', 'Fostering', 'Fright', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Human Genome Project', 'Human Volunteers', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Informed Consent', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Interview', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Negative Valence', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Participant', 'Personhood', 'Positive Valence', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Public Health', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Risk', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Testing', 'Theoretical model', 'Translations', 'Trust', 'Universities', 'Vision', 'Work', 'addiction', 'base', 'brain machine interface', 'brain research', 'clinical care', 'decision research', 'design', 'evidence base', 'health disparity', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'innovative neurotechnologies', 'insight', 'member', 'neuroethics', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neuroregulation', 'new technology', 'novel', 'optogenetics', 'patient engagement', 'prevent', 'programs', 'sound', 'standard measure', 'tool', 'vaccine development', 'volunteer']",NIMH,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,454017,0.026134895889723193
"Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Title: Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder Multiple human imaging studies have described aberrant spatiotemporal dynamics in specific brain networks across subjects with major depressive disorder. Furthermore, rodent studies have identified dysfunctional synchrony across cortical limbic circuits in genetic and stress- induced models of major depressive disorder. Nevertheless, it remains to be clarified whether these observed changes in neural dynamics play a causal role or simply reflect (i.e., correlate with) the behavioral-state observed in major depressive disorder. Several major challenges to addressing this question exist. 1) The brain synchronizes dynamics across multiple timescales. Rodent studies classically monitor dynamics at the millisecond time scale (reflecting circuits), and human studies typically monitor brain dynamics at the seconds time scale (reflect circuit and network level activity). 2) Rodent studies are generally limited in their ability to monitor large-scale activity from many brain regions concurrently, while human imaging studies observe activity across the whole brain. 3) To our knowledge, few approaches/models integrate changes in cell-type specific gene expression implicated in depression to changes in circuit and network- specific brain dynamics. 4) Techniques which directly manipulate brain dynamics (neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling) have yet to be largely implemented throughout the rodent research community. To address these challenges, we propose to perform multi-circuit in vivo neural recordings in the two widely used rodent models of depression. We will then utilize machine learning to determine the spatiotemporal dynamic alterations that are shared between the two models. Next, we will test whether cellular molecular manipulations implicated in major depressive disorder are sufficient to induce the same spatiotemporal dynamic alterations. Finally, we will verify that these spatiotemporal dynamics are causal by directly inducing and suppressing them and measuring their impact on behavior. This strategy will yield an unprecedented understanding of how altered dynamics within specific brain circuits contribute to depression. Many cortical and limbic brain regions including prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus work together to coordinate emotional, social and cognitive function in health and disease. In this study, we will discover the network-level mechanisms whereby fast interactions between these brain regions become altered in major depressive disorder. The discovery and validation of this ‘depression brain-state’ may facilitate the development of new therapeutics that ameliorate depression by directly modulating altered neural dynamics in the brain.",Dissecting and modifying temporal dynamics underlying major depressive disorder,10004169,R01MH120158,"['Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Anxiety', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Control', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'Cells', 'Chronic', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Frequencies', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Memory', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Outcome', 'Play', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Rodent Model', 'Role', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Functioning', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Viral', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'base', 'cell type', 'cognitive function', 'depression model', 'depressive symptoms', 'emotional functioning', 'human imaging', 'imaging study', 'in vivo', 'millisecond', 'mouse model', 'multidisciplinary', 'network models', 'neuromechanism', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optogenetics', 'preclinical study', 'relating to nervous system', 'reward processing', 'social defeat', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,713309,0.020430029816315625
"A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The metabolite and neurotransmitter profiles of neural tissues provide a unique window into brain’s physiological state and can be used to extract potential biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) allows simultaneous mapping and quantification of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters without exogenous contrast agents thus promised tremendous opportunities for molecular imaging of the brain. However, due to several fundamental technical challenges, including low SNR, poor spatial resolution, long imaging time and inaccurate separation of spectrally overlapping molecular signals, most in vivo MRSI studies to date are still limited to very low-resolution experiments (~1cm3 voxel size) with small brain coverages. The primary goal of this proposed research is to develop, optimize and evaluate a new framework to model, acquire and process MRSI data to enable simultaneous, high-resolution, whole- brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time. To achieve this goal, in Aim 1, we will design and implement a novel acquisition strategy that synergistically combines SNR- efficient, multi-slab and multi-TE excitation, sparse sampling in a (k,t,TE)-space and optimized TE selection with maximum echo sampling to generate J-resolved (multi-TE) MRSI data with an unprecedented combination of speed, resolution and organ coverage. In Aim 2, we will develop novel nonlinear low-dimensional models of general MR spectra using a learning-based strategy that integrates the biochemical priors of neural tissues, known physics-based MRSI signal modeling and deep neural networks. These learned models will effectively reduce the dimensionality of the imaging problem and allow for significantly improved speed, resolution and SNR tradeoffs as well as signal separation. Novel computational solutions that effectively exploit the learned models and other spatial-spectral-TE constraints will be developed for spatiospectral reconstruction of metabolites and neurotransmitters from the noisy, high-resolution J-resolved MRSI data. Finally, in Aim 3, we will systematically evaluate the proposed technology in terms of speed, resolution, SNR, and quantitative accuracy using computer simulations, phantom and in vivo experiments. The feasibility and robustness of the proposed technology for mapping metabolites and neurotransmitters in both healthy volunteers and temporal lobe epilepsy patients with mesial temporal sclerosis will be demonstrated. The success of the proposed research will lead to significant progress for in vivo MRSI and represent an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases. This tool, when fully developed, will add a transformative dimension to the existing neuroimaging technology profiles, with the potential to impact the diagnosis and management of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. PROJECT NARRATIVE Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a potentially powerful modality that allows simultaneous mapping of a number of metabolites and neurotransmitters noninvasively, which provide a unique window into brain’s physiological states and can be used to extract biomarkers for detecting and characterizing neurodegenerative diseases. However, the current MRSI techniques do not provide the desired combination of resolution, imaging speed and organ coverage for many basic science and clinical applications. The proposed research will develop a new rapid, J-resolved MRSI technology to enable high-resolution, whole-brain mapping of metabolites and neurotransmitters in clinically feasible time, which, if successful, will lead to significant progress for the field of MRSI and an important step towards the creation of a powerful tool for studying the molecular basis of brain functions and diseases.",A New J-Resolved MRSI Framework for Whole-Brain Simultaneous Metabolite and Neurotransmitter Mapping,10057847,R21EB029076,"['Address', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Mapping', 'Brain imaging', 'Clinical', 'Computer Simulation', 'Contrast Media', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Equation', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Designs', 'Foundations', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging problem', 'Imaging technology', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mechanics', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Monitor', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurologic', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Physics', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiological', 'Physiological Processes', 'Process', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Scheme', 'Scientist', 'Sclerosis', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Solid', 'Spectrum Analysis', 'Speed', 'Technology', 'Temporal Lobe Epilepsy', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Water', 'base', 'clinical application', 'clinical translation', 'computerized data processing', 'deep neural network', 'design', 'experimental study', 'healthy volunteer', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'innovation', 'interest', 'magnetic field', 'magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging', 'molecular imaging', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'potential biomarker', 'quantum', 'reconstruction', 'relating to nervous system', 'simulation', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'success', 'tool']",NIBIB,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT URBANA-CHAMPAIGN,R21,2020,565546,0.02047333251611037

"Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome Project Summary In the healthy brain, large-scale white matter architecture and local neuronal membrane properties facilitate seamless transitions between cognitive states. Patients with schizophrenia display significant white matter abnormalities with disorganized brain activity. However, the degree to which dysfunctional brain activity in psychosis arises from structural or functional pathology remains unknown. The identification of conclusive neuroimaging findings in this cohort has been challenged by 1) inadequate methods to assess distributed multimodal pathological phenotypes, and 2) the significant pathogenetic heterogeneity in schizophrenia. Practically, the latter challenge can be in part addressed by the study of chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22qDS), where the prevalence of clinical schizophrenia is 25-fold higher than that of healthy individuals. The former challenge can be addressed by recent advances in network science and machine learning, which have generated insights about structure-function relationships in the healthy brain. Utilizing these methods to study the spectrum of psychotic symptoms in a population with a defined genetic lesion is a promising direction for investigating psychosis pathophysiology. In this proposal, we describe the development of a novel time-point-based analysis of functional neuroimaging data to study structure-function relationships in a sample of patients with 22qDS currently being seen at the Hospital for the University of Pennsylvania. Using neuroimaging data from a large sample of youths (n = 690) acquired through the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, our preliminary analyses demonstrate previously uncharacterized relationships between brain structure, brain activity, and working memory performance. In this proposal, we aim to 1) compare brain state transition dynamics across the psychotic spectrum of 22qDS, 2) compare structure-function coupling in 22qDS to healthy controls and relate structure-function coupling to psychotic symptom severity, and 3) relate state transition dynamics to working memory performance in 22qDS. A better understanding of the underlying mechanism of psychosis-spectrum symptoms would lay the groundwork for the development of targeted therapies for psychosis. Furthermore, utilizing a cohort with a known genetic lesion provides a unique opportunity to bridge our understanding of molecular mechanisms with neuroimaging biomarkers for psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Project Narrative Targeted, informed therapies in neuropsychiatric disease remain elusive in part due to a lack of understanding of how complex patterns of brain activity arise from stationary white matter architecture. We propose to apply a novel method based on machine learning and network science to provide a new perspective on structure-function relationships in healthy controls as well as a sample of patients with psychosis secondary to chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Our study will leverage the presence of a consistent genetic lesion in this patient cohort to generate findings that could lay the groundwork for the development of interventions to restore healthy brain dynamics in individuals with psychosis-spectrum symptoms.",Structural constraints on large-scale brain activity in psychosis associated with chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome,9872025,F30MH118871,"['22q11.2', 'Address', 'Architecture', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Chromosomes', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Complex', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Development', 'DiGeorge Syndrome', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Executive Dysfunction', 'Exhibits', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Membrane', 'Memory', 'Memory impairment', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Occupational', 'Pathologic', 'Pathology', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Philadelphia', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Prevalence', 'Probability', 'Property', 'Psychopathology', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Reporting', 'Rest', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Secondary to', 'Self-Direction', 'Severities', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Symptoms', 'Task Performances', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'University Hospitals', 'Youth', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'cognitive control', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cohort', 'early onset', 'insight', 'learning network', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuropsychiatry', 'neurotransmission', 'novel', 'preservation', 'psychotic symptoms', 'regional difference', 'selective attention', 'symptomatology', 'targeted treatment', 'therapy development', 'white matter']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,F30,2020,50520,0.04744748971636526
"Reconstructions and Representations of Cerebral Cortex Project Summary This project will generate extensive new findings about cortical organization and connectivity in humans and nonhuman primates using high quality, multimodal datasets provided by our collaborators and by the young adult Human Connectome Project (YA-HCP). It will accelerate progress by freely sharing the resulting tools and experimental data with the scientific community. The first aim will provide a critically needed evaluation of non-invasive connectivity measures in relation to invasive anatomical tracers in macaque monkeys. Different methods for estimating fMRI-derived functional connectivity will be evaluated in order to determine which approach best correlates with `ground truth' tracer-based anatomical connectivity. This aim will also generate new insights about cortical evolution by comparing areal organization across humans, macaques, and marmosets using a novel approach in which areal features (myelin maps, resting-state networks, and identified homologous areas) constrain the registration between species. The second aim will focus on cortical organization in individual subjects using refined HCP-style analysis tools. It will optimize and evaluate intersubject alignment (using a recently developed Multimodal Surface Matching method) and individual-subject parcellation (using a machine learning based areal classifier). An important outcome will be recommendations of `best practice' for other projects that acquire less fMRI data than in the YA- HCP. These data will also be used to characterize individual variability of human cortical areas. For each of 180 areas, individual differences in size and topology (neighborhood relationships) will be examined for heritability and for symmetry across the two hemispheres. Additional analyses will reveal whether some areas are reproducibly absent in some individuals and whether `novel' areas are present in some subjects. The third aim is to enhance the capabilities of the Connectome Workbench visualization and analysis platform and the BALSA database that were introduced during previous grant periods. Enhancements to Connectome Workbench will: (i) enable non-invasive electrophysiological (MEG/EEG) and invasive neurophysiological data to be integrated with MRI data and atlas-based connectivity data (ii) facilitate interoperability across different atlases, (iii) improve interactive `HCP-style' analysis capabilities, and (iv) enable cortical layer-based analyses. Enhancements to the BALSA database include: (i) a WebGL-based web-viewer for interactive online visualization with special focus on the unique data generated by this project, (ii) an online spatial localization tool and (iii) support for uploading scene files to BALSA from 5 other software platforms besides Workbench. Relevance This project will evaluate the accuracy of noninvasive methods for estimating brain connectivity in humans and monkeys, compare areal organization across species, and characterize individual variability of cortical organization using a multimodal parcellation derived from the Human Connectome Project. Results will be shared via a state-of-the-art database that stores extensively analyzed data.

"BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR) To take advantage of recent and ongoing advances in intensive and large-scale computational methods, and to preserve the scientific data created by publicly funded research projects, data archives must be created as well as standards for specifying, identifying, and annotating deposited data. The value of and interest in such archives among researchers can be greatly increased by adding to them an active computational capability and framework of analysis and search tools that support further analysis as well as larger scale meta-analysis and large scale data mining. The OpenNeuro.org archive, begun as a repository for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, is such an archive. We propose to build a gateway to OpenNeuro for human electrophysiology data (EEG and MEG, as well as intracranial data recorded from clinical patients to plan brain surgeries or other therapies) – herein we refer to these modalities as neuroelectromagnetic (NEM) data. The Neuroelectromagnetic Data Archive and Tools Resource (NEMAR) at the San Diego Supercomputer Center will act as a gateway to OpenNeuro for NEM data research. Such data uploaded to NEMAR at SDSC will be deposited in the OpenNeuro archive. Still- private NEM data in OpenNeuro will, on user request, be copied to the NEMAR gateway for further user processing using the XSEDE high-performance resources at SDSC in conjunction with The Neuroscience Gateway (nsgportal.org), a freely available and easy to use portal to use of high-performance computing resources for neuroscience research. Publicly available OpenNeuro NEM data will be able to be analyzed by running verified analysis applications on the OpenNeuro system. In this project we will build an application to evaluate the quality of uploaded NEM data, and another to visualize the data, for EEG and MEG at both the scalp and brain source levels, including time-domain and frequency-domain dynamics time locked to sets of experimental events learned from the BIDS- and HED-formatted data annotations. The NEMAR gateway will take a major step toward applying machine learning methods to a large store of carefully collected and stored human electrophysiologic brain data to spur new developments in basic and clinical brain research. The NEMAR gateway to the OpenNeuro.org human neuroimaging data archive will build tools to add human electrical and magnetic brain activity records to the archive, to evaluate its quality for users and visualize its features. The resulting facility will allow applications of new machine learning methods to research on human brain dynamics that can be expected to lead to breakthroughs in understanding how the human brain supports our awareness and behavior in both health and disease.",BRAIN INITIATIVE RESOURCE: DEVELOPMENT OF A HUMAN NEUROELECTROMAGNETIC DATA ARCHIVE AND TOOLS RESOURCE (NEMAR),9985198,R24MH120037,"['Archives', 'Awareness', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Clinical', 'Cloud Computing', 'Communities', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Deposition', 'Descriptor', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Educational workshop', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Event', 'Frequencies', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Grant', 'Health', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Infrastructure', 'Internet', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Libraries', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetism', 'Magnetoencephalography', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Privatization', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Records', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resource Development', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Scalp structure', 'Science', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Spottings', 'Staging', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Visualization software', 'base', 'brain research', 'brain surgery', 'built environment', 'computational platform', 'computerized data processing', 'computing resources', 'cyber infrastructure', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data archive', 'data curation', 'data format', 'data mining', 'data quality', 'data structure', 'data submission', 'data tools', 'hackathon', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'machine learning method', 'neuroimaging', 'preservation', 'repository', 'response', 'sensor', 'structured data', 'supercomputer', 'support tools', 'tool', 'tool development', 'web interface', 'web services', 'web site']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R24,2020,900723,-0.016766292132782093
"A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive Project Summary The Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative promotes the development and application of technologies to describe the temporal and spatial dynamics of cell types and neural circuits in the brain. The Principal Investigator, senior personnel and staff of this project have diverse expertise required to marshall data across the BRAIN Initiative consortium, including experience in data collection from multiple institutions, large-scale quality control and analysis processing capability, familiarity with NIH policy and public archive deposition strategies. To promote smooth interactions across a large research consortium, we will develop the Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive), a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects. We will utilize a federated model for data storage such that the physical location of data can be distributed between the NeMO local file system, public repositories, and a cloud-based storage system (e.g. Amazon S3). We will leverage this capability and distribute BRAIN Initiative data between our local filesystem and the cloud. The Nemo Archive will be a data resource consistent with the principles advanced by research community members who are launching resources in next generation NIH data ecosystem. These practices include FAIR Principles, documentation of APIs, data-indexing systems, workflow sharing, use of shareable software pipelines and storage on cloud-based systems. The information incorporating into the NeMO archive will, in part, enable understanding of 1) genomic regions associated with brain abnormalities and disease; 2) transcription factor binding sites and other regulatory elements; 3) transcription activity; 4) levels of cytosine modification; and 5) histone modification profiles and chromatin accessibility. It will enable users to answer diverse questions of relevance to brain research, such as identifying diagnostic candidates, predicting prognosis, selecting treatments, and testing hypotheses. It will also provide the basic knowledge to guide the development and execution of predictive and machine learning algorithms in the future.   Project Narrative The Neuroscience Multi-Omic Archive (NeMO Archive) is a data repository that is specifically focused on the storage and dissemination of omic data from the BRAIN Initiative and related brain research projects.",A BRAIN Initiative Resource: The Neuroscience Multi-omic Data Archive,9989180,R24MH114788,"['Archives', 'Atlases', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Binding Sites', 'Bioconductor', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Chromatin', 'Communities', 'Computer software', 'Cytosine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Coordinating Center', 'Data Management Resources', 'Data Storage and Retrieval', 'Databases', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Docking', 'Documentation', 'Elements', 'Ensure', 'Familiarity', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genomic Segment', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Internet', 'Knowledge', 'Location', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurosciences', 'Patients', 'Personnel Staffing', 'Phenotype', 'Policies', 'Principal Investigator', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Quality Control', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resources', 'Running', 'Services', 'Site', 'Standardization', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Visualization', 'Visualization software', 'Work', 'analysis pipeline', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain research', 'cell type', 'cloud based', 'cloud storage', 'complex R', 'computerized data processing', 'data archive', 'data centers', 'data ecosystem', 'data ingestion', 'data integration', 'data pipeline', 'data resource', 'data standards', 'data submission portal', 'data visualization', 'data warehouse', 'database structure', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'histone modification', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'member', 'multiple data types', 'multiple omics', 'neural circuit', 'next generation', 'online resource', 'operation', 'outcome forecast', 'programs', 'public repository', 'query tools', 'repository', 'tool', 'transcription factor', 'web site', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R24,2020,1263611,0.07177029364020453
"Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology Project Summary/Abstract The candidate’s long-term goal is to become an independent investigator focused on the neurophysiological pathways that link psychological stress with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Individual differences in biological responses to acute psychological stress have been shown to predict risk for subclinical and clinical markers of CVD, indicating that variation in the stress response relates to measurable health outcomes. The proposed research and career development program will position the candidate to definitively address open and mechanistic questions on cardiovascular stress physiology with a multi-dimensional approach. The overall objective of the current project is to identify the ‘brain–cardiovascular’ pathways of metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress. The central hypothesis is that metabolically excessive cardiovascular responses to stress are caused by increased brain activation in areas associated with cardiovascular and autonomic control. In extension, the candidate will test whether altering brain function via neuromodulation will regulate downstream cardiovascular responses. Proposed are two independent studies. In Aim 1, we will newly examine the relationship between metabolically excessive cardiovascular and neural responses using a cross-sectional approach. In Aim 2, we will measure stressor-evoked metabolic and cardiovascular responses before and after neuromodulation in an experimental approach. Participants will engage in a novel, non-invasive neuromodulation technique, transcranial infrared laser stimulation (TILS), known to alter the brain by increasing oxygenation, and will be compared to an established control. This research plan will help the candidate develop essential skills for career development including cardiovascular and metabolic testing, machine learning and cross-validation methods for functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses, and utilizing a neuromodulation technique, TILS. The proposed Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will provide 5 years of training through a combination of research, classroom experiences, and mentoring to further the candidate in preparation for scientific independence. Specifically, the candidate will gain expertise in measuring metabolic activity, advance her computational neuroimaging analysis skills, become proficient in experimentally manipulating brain function, and develop necessary statistical skills. The project brings together a mentoring team of experts in their respective areas to provide the candidate with the necessary skills to continue on the trajectory to make a transformative contribution to the field of Cardiovascular Behavioral Medicine. This project will provide vital information regarding the pathways between psychological stress and CVD risk while at the same time providing training and mentoring for the candidate’s further career. PROJECT NARRATIVE Exaggerated physiological responses to psychological stress are commonly regarded as contributing to cardiovascular disease (CVD), nonetheless, we lack an understanding of the mechanisms by which psychological responses to threat are translated into cardiovascular responses that are excessive to the immediate physiological needs of the individual. The project will use both cross-sectional and experimental approaches to examine how the brain and cardiovascular system interact during psychological stress and will provide a a more comprehensive understanding of the role the brain plays in metabolically-excessive responses to stress. This research is relevant to public health because it is a crucial step in understanding how psychological stress relates to a risk factor for CVD and is necessary to develop appropriate brain- based approaches to CVD risk prevention and stratification.",Brain substrates for cardiovascular stress physiology,9986887,K01HL145021,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Area', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Base of the Brain', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Biological', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Brain region', 'Calibration', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Clinical Markers', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lasers', 'Limbic System', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Mentored Research Scientist Development Award', 'Mentors', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolic Pathway', 'Metabolic stress', 'Methods', 'Nature', 'Neuraxis', 'Nucleic Acid Regulatory Sequences', 'Outcome', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Participant', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pattern', 'Peripheral', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Preparation', 'Prevention', 'Professional Competence', 'Program Development', 'Psychological Stress', 'Public Health', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Role', 'Source', 'Stratification', 'Stress', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'biological adaptation to stress', 'cardiovascular disorder risk', 'cardiovascular risk factor', 'career', 'career development', 'experience', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'neuroregulation', 'novel', 'pre-clinical', 'psychologic', 'relating to nervous system', 'research and development', 'response', 'skills', 'stressor', 'time use']",NHLBI,BAYLOR UNIVERSITY,K01,2020,152186,0.013967958371278705
"Center for Mesoscale Mapping Overview of the Proposed Resource – Abstract The goal of the Center for Mesoscale Mapping is to drive the convergence of microscopic- and macroscopic- scale evaluation of brain structure and function for human translational neuroscience, by developing and applying tools to study the spatial distribution and temporal orchestration of mesoscopic events in the human brain. Our Collaborators will, through a dynamic “push-pull” relationship, provide unique problems which drive the development of these tools, and in return guide us in the design and optimization of our toolbox for practical use in a variety of normal and disease settings. While there is still no formal consensus on the definition of mesoscopic within the neuroscience community, we take as our guide the spatial and temporal scales at which local groups of neurons act in coherent fashion – in the cortex, this includes the spatial scale of columns and laminar structures (between ~0.1-1 mm), while in deeper structures includes the myriad of deep brain and brainstem nuclei. Preliminary data from our own center, and of course others throughout the world, now support the notion that we are on the threshold of being able to map, measure and perturb the human brain at these scales, and do so comprehensively across wide swaths of the human brain. Temporally too, recent advances suggest a convergence between temporal scales addressable with tools like fMRI, which can now investigate delta frequency coherent phenomena, and advanced electromagnetic tools to measure and perturb coherent electrophysiological activity at higher frequencies still. With this convergence in mind, the tools we proposed to develop within the TRDs of the CMM will provide our Collaborative and Service User community with the important “missing links” between the advances in human cognitive neuroscience at the “system level,” and the enormous strides in cellular level circuit functional characterization. Our Collaborators will bring their own unique challenges to help us define and further refine these tools, offering problems requiring distinct measures of human brain structural and functional properties in a variety of normal and disease settings. Our Service Users will utilize our tools to better understand human neural systems, and particularly human disease states from multiple sclerosis to Alzheimer’s, to depression and epilepsy. Finally, our Center will seek to disseminate these tools, through open-source software and hardware designs, industrial partnerships and “hands-on” teaching courses for hardware, and to train a new generation of human neuroscientists in the use of our advanced tools to explore the human brain at this next frontier.

"Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD Millions of Americans survive traumatic events (1). Symptom trajectories over the initial year  after trauma can lead to development of chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or to a  recovery free of PTSD (2-16). Neuroimaging studies indicate chronic PTSD symptoms are associated  with changes in brain function and structure (17-32); consequently, recognition of early  post-trauma brain changes provides an opportunity to predict chronic PTSD (33-35). Identification  of brain changes that underlie post-trauma symptom progressions will also provide insight into  mechanisms that distinguish PTSD development from PTSD free recovery (27, 36- 38). Surprisingly,  progressive brain changes early after trauma have rarely been studied in trauma survivors who  subsequently develop PTSD (33, 34). Recent results from the PI’s R21 grant provide indications of  both early and progressive brain differences in trauma survivors who were subsequently diagnosed  with PTSD at 3 months as compared to non-PTSD survivors. These differences include smaller volumes  of left hippocampus (HC) and rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) and greater prefrontal cortex  (PFC) activation to an fMRI emotion appraisal task within 10 days after trauma. Furthermore, in  survivors who developed PTSD at 3 months, progressive decreases in PFC structure and fear appraisal  activation and increases in emotional responses in insular cortex (IC) were found over 3 months.  Based on these findings we developed a working hypothesis on early and progressive emotion circuit  changes that lead to PTSD development. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use a cohort of  trauma survivors to identify early and progressive brain changes that contribute to, and that can  be used to predict, chronic PTSD. Trauma survivors recruited in Emergency Departments (EDs) will be longitudinally studied, starting  within 2 weeks and out to 1 year after trauma. Functional MRI (fMRI) activation associated with  processing, memory, and regulation of negative emotions will be studied in PTSD and non-PTSD trauma  survivors using Shifted- attention Emotion Appraisal (SEAT) and Fear Conditioning (FCT) tasks.  Structural MRI (sMRI) will examine structures in brain emotion circuits. Early brain functional and  structural differences and symptoms in survivors who do versus do not develop PTSD at 1 year after  trauma will be identified and analyzed using machine learning approaches to predict PTSD versus  non-PTSD outcomes. Differences over time in brain function and structure in PTSD and non-PTSD  survivors will be identified, and associations between these differences and progressions of  symptoms will be examined. The proposed work fills an important gap in current understanding by  identifying early and progressive brain changes that contribute to PTSD development. Our approach  can serve to identify brain-based markers for PTSD development and to identify trauma survivors at  high risk for chronic PTSD. PTSD is recognized as a public health problem due to its high prevalence, persistence, and socio-  economic burden. Built on recent work by the PI, this proposal will identify early brain changes  that precede and predict chronic PTSD. This application meets the strategic objectives of NIMH in  applying longitudinal neuroimaging approaches for recognizing early trajectories of brain changes  that can be used in early identification of trauma survivors who are vulnerable to develop PTSD and  in evaluating early prevention of PTSD.",Study of early brain alterations that predict development of chronic PTSD,10004715,R01MH110483,"['Accident and Emergency department', 'Acute Pain', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anterior', 'Attention', 'Base of the Brain', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Economic Burden', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Evaluation', 'Fright', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Grant', 'High Prevalence', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Intervention', 'Lead', 'Left', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Medial', 'Memory', 'Monitor', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Recovery', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Severities', 'Stress Tests', 'Structure', 'Survivors', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thick', 'Time', 'Trauma', 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'Work', 'acute stress', 'associated symptom', 'base', 'brain volume', 'cingulate cortex', 'cohort', 'conditioned fear', 'density', 'emotion regulation', 'exhaustion', 'gray matter', 'high risk', 'insight', 'neuroimaging', 'pain symptom', 'post-trauma', 'prevent', 'prospective', 'recruit', 'response', 'socioeconomics', 'stress related disorder', 'stress symptom', 'trauma exposure', 'trauma symptom', 'traumatic event']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF TOLEDO HEALTH SCI CAMPUS,R01,2020,658730,0.059799634978958204
"Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles Anxiety and related disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), are leading causes of global disability. Brain circuit abnormalities have been identified, but important knowledge gaps remain. It is unclear which abnormalities underlie what symptom profiles, how dysfunction develops and thus which brain abnormalities to target with new interventions. Moreover, circuit abnormalities likely cut across traditional diagnostic categories and, within a diagnostic category, there is individual variability. Our approach is to identify reproducible brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms; these brain signatures can then be used to reveal trans-diagnostic disease dimensions, to chart their development, and to develop treatments that target these circuit abnormalities directly.  The goal of this proposal is to identify reproducible brain signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD. To accomplish this, we will study 250 unmedicated OCD and 250 healthy control subjects (HCs) at five expert research sites spanning five countries (U.S., Brazil, India, Netherlands, and South Africa). Using imaging methods that could ultimately be adapted for clinical use, we will examine multiple brain circuits thought to underlie OCD behaviors, focusing on morphometry (using T1- weighted MRI), structural connectivity (using Diffusion Tensor Imaging [DTI]), and functional connectivity (using resting-state fMRI [rs-fMRI]). We will identify neuroimaging signatures that distinguish individuals with OCD from HCs by analyzing each modality with standardized protocols and by using multi-modal fusion with modern machine learning statistical methods. We will then examine how these imaging signatures are linked to behavioral performance on cognitive tasks that probe these same circuits and to a range of clinical profiles that are common to OCD. Finally, we will explore how specific environmental features (childhood trauma, socioeconomic status, religiosity) may moderate this brain-behavior relationship. Our short-term goal is to identify brain signatures of OCD cognitive and clinical profiles, leveraging our global collaboration both to recruit a very large unmedicated sample and to prove these signatures' reproducibility. Our long-term goal is to identify brain signatures for measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms that cut across traditional diagnostic categories and to use these signatures to transform how we conceptualize, diagnose and ultimately treat mental illnesses like OCD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder, and fewer than half of OCD patients become well with current treatments. This study seeks to identify reproducible neuroimaging signatures associated with cognitive and clinical profiles that are common in individuals with OCD and that transcend countries/cultures. Identifying brain signatures of measurable behaviors and clinical symptoms will provide robust new treatment targets and help pave the way to precision psychiatry where individual brain signatures can help guide treatment choices.  ",Identifying Reproducible Brain Signatures of Obsessive-Compulsive Profiles,9926317,R01MH113250,"['Age of Onset', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Disorders', 'Behavioral', 'Bilateral', 'Brain', 'Brazil', 'Categories', 'Cerebellum', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Cognition Disorders', 'Cognitive', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Country', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Dorsal', 'Emotional', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Globus Pallidus', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Image', 'India', 'Individual', 'Inferior', 'Insula of Reil', 'International Classification of Diseases', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Netherlands', 'Obsession', 'Obsessive compulsive behavior', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Prevalence', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Site', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'South Africa', 'Standardization', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stereotyping', 'Structural defect', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Transcend', 'Update', 'World Health Organization', 'anxiety-related disorders', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain behavior', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive task', 'comorbidity', 'compulsion', 'disability', 'disease classification', 'executive function', 'illness length', 'imaging modality', 'individual variation', 'insight', 'morphometry', 'motor control', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel diagnostics', 'pediatric trauma', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'statistical and machine learning', 'treatment choice']",NIMH,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2020,838291,0.05765656405107311
"Neurocognitive deficits and compensation in binge drinkers ABSTRACT  Binge or heavy episodic drinking has been on the rise and is associated with a range of harmful consequences that scale up with the high intensity drinking prevalent among young adults. Evidence on the nature and extent of neural changes associated with binge drinking (BD) is scant, especially as regards sex differences, so more sensitive, high-precision imaging modalities are needed to examine persistent brain alterations. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based methods are sensitive to brain function, as well as different neural tissue properties, and are well suited to provide multidimensional insight into the structure and organization of the brain. Despite a paucity of neuroimaging studies in BD, evidence obtained from individuals with alcohol use disorder suggests that degradation of prefrontal functions may contribute to impaired executive functions and an inability to refrain from hazardous drinking. Consistent with findings in alcohol use disorder, our data and other evidence indicate that BD participants show compensatory engagement of additional brain areas to maintain adequate performance on cognitively demanding tasks. Complementary MRI modalities can reveal the nature and regional specificity of structural degradation that underlies and constrains the compensatory reorganization.  The overall aim of this project is to use a range of MRI-based methods to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult binge drinking men and women. Because of their spatial precision and sensitivity to different neural tissue properties and functional features, MRI-based methods can provide insights into structural and functional alterations at the level of an interactive system. Specifically, BOLD fMRI will evaluate functional activation during tasks that probe cognitive control; resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) analysis will examine alterations at the level of a functional network, while structural degradation will be reflected in gray and white matter morphometric features. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) will characterize white matter microstructure and tract-based changes. These measures will be obtained from young adult men and women (18-30 yrs) who will be assigned to binge drinking (BD) and light drinking (LD) groups based on their drinking patterns and will be equated on age, race/ethnicity, and family history of alcoholism. Interactions between binge drinking and sex will be examined in all analyses. Overall, we hypothesize that neural alterations will correlate with a range of alcohol-related variables, with greater deficits and increased compensatory activity observed in BDs who engage in higher intensity drinking, with BD women being especially susceptible to functional deficits and structural degradation. Data will be integrated across imaging modalities in a machine learning classifier framework that will inform a predictive model of drinking trajectories based on 6-mos and 12-mos longitudinal follow-ups. Combined with a rich set of drinking indices, personality and behavioral variables, a constellation of brain measures will provide a mechanistic insight into the type and extend of the neural degradation underlying executive deficits and compensatory brain reorganization. NARRATIVE  The overall aim of this project is to use a multimodal MRI approach to examine functional indices and structural correlates of executive deficits and compensatory mechanisms in young adult men and women engaging in binge drinking.

"Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery Recent years have seen rapid growth in the availability of large, complex functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets of the human brain. However, the potential of this fMRI Big Data is presently limited by our understanding of the neural sources that contribute to fMRI signals. Fluctuations in arousal (i.e., in the level wakefulness and alertness) are known to modulate cognitive and behavioral processes and to display prominent alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Yet, since the vast majority of fMRI datasets lack neurophysiological or behavioral indices of arousal, fMRI Big Data cannot be readily harnessed to understand human brain arousal in health and disease. Recent data-driven approaches attempt to fill this gap but have limitations. The overall goal of this proposal is to increase the transformative potential of fMRI Big Data for human neuroscience through a novel analytic framework for detecting arousal fluctuations from fMRI data alone. We will accomplish this goal by developing and disseminating tools for modeling arousal fluctuations based on powerful statistical learning methods (Specific Aim 1). We will apply these models to large fMRI databases of healthy aging and Alzheimer’s Disease, both of which are associated with altered arousal (Specific Aims 2 and 3). We will capitalize on these databases to determine how knowledge of brain arousal fluctuations improves neuroimaging biomarkers of aging- and neurodegenerative disease-related changes in human brain function, and the extent to which arousal itself constitutes an informative biomarker of these states. This research would, moreover, increase the reliability and translational potential of fMRI studies more broadly by providing the ability to account for these major neural (arousal) state changes. These immediate research goals form a strong bridge with my long-term research objective of understanding principles of brain function by developing and innovatively adapting methods for the analysis of large and complex neuroimaging datasets. This objective is enabled by the mentored training plan, where I will (i) develop expertise in cutting-edge machine learning techniques and (ii) apply these techniques to multimodal neuroimaging data. The two co-mentors have complementary expertise that align, respectively, with these two training components. Aims 1 and 2 will span the mentored phase and part of the independent phase, while Aim 3 (application to the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data) will be performed in the independent phase. The mentored environment of the NIH Intramural Research Program provides the resources for all planned data acquisition, as well as a rich community of neuroscience investigators and seminars. Interaction with the extramural (Columbia University) co-mentor will occur through frequent video conferences and several visits, with opportunities to engage with the Columbia data science community. Developing models of brain arousal fluctuations in fMRI data would contribute to our understanding of arousal mechanisms and its alteration with a variety of brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease. Further, the ability to account for arousal fluctuations in fMRI data analysis would broadly improve the sensitivity of fMRI for neuroscience and clinical research, and may be critical for developing reliable, noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment.",Tracking brain arousal fluctuations for fMRI Big Data discovery,9982966,K22ES028048,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Arousal', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological Availability', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Cognitive', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Discovery', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Electroencephalography', 'Environment', 'Extramural Activities', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phase', 'Physiologic Monitoring', 'Physiological', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Signal Transduction', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Space Models', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Visit', 'Wakefulness', 'Work', 'age related', 'aged', 'alertness', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'big-data science', 'brain dysfunction', 'career', 'clinical database', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'dimensional analysis', 'experience', 'flexibility', 'healthy aging', 'high dimensionality', 'human data', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'indexing', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroimaging marker', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'novel', 'rapid growth', 'recurrent neural network', 'relating to nervous system', 'specific biomarkers', 'statistical learning', 'statistics', 'symposium', 'tool', 'usability', 'visual tracking']",NIEHS,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,K22,2020,202463,-0.00685842877257925
"Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity This proposal describes a rigorous and comprehensive plan designed to obtain expert training in advanced MRI acquisition and analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and fetal programming of health and disease risk. The proposed research relates to the public health problem of childhood obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. Obesity is a multi-factorial phenotype. Among these factors, the critical importance of energy homeostasis (balance), and the hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates it, is well established. However, it is unclear whether the observed difference in this brain circuitry between obese and normal-weight individuals is a cause or consequence of the obese state. Also, relatively little is known about the developmental origin (fetal and early postnatal) of variation in this brain circuitry and its prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. My proposal addresses this fundamental knowledge gap. I advance the overarching hypothesis that energy homeostasis brain circuitry a) already is established by the time of birth; b) exhibits developmental plasticity (fetal programming); and c) is functionally relevant (predicts postnatal adipose tissue accrual). The K99 mentored phase will be conducted under the mentorship of leading experts in fetal programming of health and disease (P. Wadhwa), brain imaging (P. Thompson), and developmental systems neuroscience (D. Fair). I will first develop novel MRI-based measures of the newborn brain circuitry underlying energy homeostasis, and then identify the prenatal determinants of variation in this circuitry. The importance of focusing efforts on the newborn brain derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time is not yet influenced by postnatal factors. In the R00 phase, I will recruit a new cohort and use a repeated measures design to address the functional relevance of the initial (newborn) setting of this brain circuitry in the context of adipose tissue accrual over infancy (a key indicator of childhood obesity risk). K99/Aim 1. Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry, this aim will fulfill an important and as yet unmet need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also technical capability. K99/Aim 2. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology) determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are associated with infant adiposity. R00/Aim 3. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity risk. R00/Aim 4. Consider the complimentary hypothesis that infant adiposity at birth is prospectively associated with changes in newborn energy homeostasis brain circuitry. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan for the applicant, Dr. Jerod Rasmussen, to obtain expert training and conduct research that aims to identify novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, identify their gestational biology determinants, and determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood obesity. The identification of brain-related biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Fetal Programming of Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks and Infant Adiposity,10022151,K99HD100593,"['Address', 'Adipose tissue', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Breathing', 'Cerebrum', 'Chemical Shift Imaging', 'Cholesterol', 'Data', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Developmental Biology', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Drug or chemical Tissue Distribution', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Endocrine', 'Endocrine system', 'Enrollment', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Etiology', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding Mechanisms', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Life', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Maternal-fetal medicine', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physics', 'Physiological', 'Pregnancy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Public Health', 'Research', 'Research Proposals', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Term Birth', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Triglycerides', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'career', 'career development', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'connectome', 'cost effective', 'data reduction', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'energy balance', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'metabolic rate', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'obstetrical complication', 'population based', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'recruit', 'sex', 'skills', 'vector', 'white matter']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,K99,2020,108600,0.08047984892632513
"Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior ABSTRACT Prenatal cocaine exposure (PCE) is consistently related to impaired attention and behavioral and physiological self-regulation in infants and young children, suggesting persistent negative impact on skills essential for optimal learning and social competence. Gestational exposure to cocaine occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, which is immediately followed by massive expansion and refinement of brain structure, functional connections and network organization in the first year of life. However, little is known about the effects of PCE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits in cognition and neurobehavior. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of PCE on the developmental trajectory of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 0-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how specific maternal caregiving characteristics (Sensitivity, Harshness) moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by PCE; deficits in developing functional connections mediate the negative effects of PCE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; postnatal maternal behaviors and environment interact with PCE to influence growth trajectories of developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the Co-PIs'strong preliminary data describing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in functional connectivity due to prenatal cocaine and other drugs in neonates (Grewen, Gao), and on Co-investigator Eiden's longitudinal studies of the behavioral effects of PCE and its moderation by maternal behaviors in infants, toddlers and children. We propose to study infant resting state functional connectivity and behavioral development at 2 weeks, 6 months and 12 months in 3 groups of infants: 120 with PCE with or without exposure to other drugs (nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, and/or opiates), 100 exposed to the same other drugs but without cocaine (OD), 100 drug-free (CTL). We will measure Maternal Sensitivity (primary), Maternal Harshness (secondary) and an index of cumulative environmental risk to determine postnatal moderation of PCE effects on developing connectivity. The rationale is that longitudinal study will reveal prenatal drug effects, determine whether the postnatal trajectory of brain functional connections is merely delayed or permanently altered by initial PCE insult, and ascertain postnatal factors contributing to greater risk or resilience in func- tional network development. This innovative approach will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural deficit and postnatal environmental influences on patterns of brain and cognitive development, and will apply hypothesis-driven and data-driven analytic methods, including machine learning, to characterize mechanisms underlying PCE effects on trajectory of brain development. Knowledge gleaned has potential to inform earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce learning and behavioral impairments in this at-risk population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal cocaine and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. It is relevant to public health because discovery of mechanisms by which prenatal cocaine exposure influences development of brain and cognition in infancy will lead to earlier, more effective interventions to prevent or reduce later disabilities, as opposed to treatment in later childhood. This research is relevant to the mission of NIDA because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population— infants exposed in utero.",Effects of prenatal cocaine on early brain functional connectivity and behavior,9980863,R01DA042988,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Fetal Cocaine Exposure', 'Future Generations', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Infant', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Lateral', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Light', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Maternal Behavior', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Nicotine', 'Opioid', 'Outcome', 'Parietal', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Populations at Risk', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Toddler', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavioral impairment', 'behavioral study', 'cingulate cortex', 'cocaine exposure', 'cognitive ability', 'cognitive development', 'disability', 'drug of abuse', 'effective intervention', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'gender difference', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'learning ability', 'maternal caregiving', 'neonatal brain', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'novel', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prevent', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'skills', 'social', 'social skills', 'success']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,682143,0.04778965318194216
"G-quadruplex DNA in senescence of the neurovascular unit Project Summary The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a functional structure that consists of endothelial cells, surrounded by an extracellular matrix, neurons, astrocytes, and pericytes. The NVU enables regulation of regional cerebral blood flow and nutrient delivery to the brain tissue. With aging, a structural weakening of the NVU occurs, which is also associated with inflammatory signaling and transport deficiencies. Critically, it is not clear how neurons, astrocytes, pericytes, and endothelial cells undergo senescence in the NVU, and whether there are differences in senescence pathways between healthy NVU aging and NVU in Alzheimer's diseases (AD). The G-quadruplex (G4) is a non-canonical DNA secondary structure formed by four DNA strands containing multiple runs of guanines. G4s play important roles in DNA recombination, replication, and regulation of transcription. In our data, we demonstrated that brain samples from aged mice contain more G4s than that of young mice. We showed that mice treated with a small-molecule G4 stabilizer develop cognitive impairment and accelerated brain aging. Using a heterochronic parabiosis mouse model, we also showed that the levels of G4s are decreased in the brain of old parabiont, compared to the age-matched iso-parabiotic mice, implicating presence of rejuvenating factors that can reverse the elevation of G4s with aging. The effect of the old parabiont on the young partner is more pronounced (more G4s in the young), suggesting a strong negative influence of aging factors. Importantly, in a mouse model of AD, we demonstrated that G4s are stabilized in the brains, well before the deposition of amyloid occurs. We hypothesize that these converging lines of evidence point at а mechanism of senescence. Thus, the primary objective of the proposed studies is to investigate G4-associated cellular senescence in the NVU, in aging and AD. In Aim 1, we will compare G4s across cell types in the NVU. In Aim 2, we will determine whether G4s preferentially accumulate in the NVUs of brain regions most vulnerable to neurodegeneration. In Aim 3, we will investigate how a peripheral factor, CXCL10, contributes to NVU's G4 senescence. G4s might be a novel pathway that can be targeted to mitigate the detrimental effects of cellular senescence in the brain. Project Narrative Senescent cells accumulate in aging and drive deficits accompanying age-associated diseases. This project investigates the role of a novel nuclear pathway, the G-quadruplex (G4) DNA pathway, in senescence of neurovascular unit (NVU) in the brain. The formation of G4 DNA is associated with chromatin remodeling, transcriptional changes, and DNA damage; we hypothesize that stabilization of G4s leads to senescence of the components of the NVU - endothelial cells, astrocytes, neurons, and pericytes.",G-quadruplex DNA in senescence of the neurovascular unit,10044252,RF1AG068292,"['Abbreviations', 'Affect', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Algorithms', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's disease model', 'Amino Acids', 'Amyloid deposition', 'Animals', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Astrocytes', 'Binding Proteins', 'Blood Circulation', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain region', 'CXC chemokine receptor 3', 'CXCL10 gene', 'Cell Aging', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Cerebrovascular Circulation', 'Chromatin', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cytoplasmic Granules', 'DNA', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Sequence', 'DNA biosynthesis', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Endothelial Cells', 'Exhibits', 'Extracellular Matrix', 'Frontotemporal Dementia', 'G-Quartets', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Alteration', 'Genes', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Guanine', 'Health', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Impaired cognition', 'In Vitro', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Interneurons', 'Lateral', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Metabolic', 'Metabolism', 'Mitotic', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Nutrient', 'Parabiosis', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pericytes', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Proteins', 'Regulation', 'Role', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stretching', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Tg2576', 'Tight Junctions', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'Water', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging brain', 'blood-brain barrier permeabilization', 'brain tissue', 'cell type', 'chemokine', 'chromatin remodeling', 'dentate gyrus', 'effective therapy', 'frontal lobe', 'hippocampal pyramidal neuron', 'mouse model', 'negative affect', 'neurovascular unit', 'normal aging', 'novel', 'oxidation', 'prevent', 'quadruplex DNA', 'senescence', 'small molecule']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR HOUSTON,RF1,2020,1560000,-0.034486158796533654
"Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity This revised application, submitted in response to NIH PA-18-741 “Secondary Analyses in Obesity,  Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases,” relates to the public health problem of childhood  obesity, with a specific focus on the characterization, determinants and role of energy balance  homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn. The proposal describes a comprehensive  plan designed to advance neonatal MRI analytical methods, developmental systems neuroscience, and  fetal programming of health and disease risk. The critical importance of the  hypothalamic-limbic-cortical brain circuitry that regulates energy homeostasis is well  established, and MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuits have been  associated with obesity outcomes. However, it is unclear whether the observed differences in these  brain regions and circuitry in obese relative to normal-weight individuals are a cause,  consequence, or both, of the obese state. Moreover, relatively little is known about the  developmental ontogeny of these brain regions and circuitry, particularly during the fetal period,  and their prospective role in shaping propensity for childhood obesity. This project addresses  this fundamental knowledge gap. We will develop novel measures and conduct analyses using newborn  brain imaging and other data elements from 4 inter-linked NIH-funded projects on prenatal stress  and fetal programming of brain development and infant body composition (R01 HD-060628; R01  MH-091351; R01 HD-065825; UG3 OD-023349). The importance of selecting the newborn brain as the  starting time point derives from the logic that brain circuitry at this time could not yet have  been influenced by postnatal factors such as diet/feeding, thereby enabling the study to  disentangle the temporality of effects. In a recent position paper on the pathogenesis of obesity,  the U.S. Endocrine Society emphasized the need to conceptualize obesity as a disorder of the  energy homeostasis system and elucidate its underlying mechanisms and developmental influences.  Towards this objective, and using a population of ~100 mother-infant dyads followed from early  gestation through birth till 5 yrs age, we will integrate research aims that leverage the resources  of these projects to advance our understanding of the origins of childhood obesity. Aim 1.  Develop measures of energy homeostasis brain circuitry using anatomical, diffusion and functional  MRI. Because such measures have not yet been established in newborn homeostasis circuitry,  this aim will fulfill an important need in terms of not only scientific knowledge but also  technical capability. Aim 2. Address the physiological relevance and clinical significance of these  novel MRI-based newborn brain measures by testing the hypothesis that measures of the human  newborn’s energy homeostasis brain circuitry are prospectively associated with infant adiposity  and subsequent childhood obesity risk. Aim 3. Identify the prenatal (gestational biology)  determinants of variation in the measures of newborn brain energy homeostasis circuitry that are  associated with infant adiposity. Significance. By identifying the role and determinants of  energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn, these findings will ultimately  provide the basis for the subsequent development of strategies aimed at the primary prevention of  childhood obesity. This proposal describes a comprehensive plan to conduct research that aims to identify  novel MRI-based measures of energy homeostasis-related brain circuitry in the human newborn,  determine the prospective association of these measures with subsequent risk for childhood  obesity, and identify their gestational biology determinants. The identification of brain-related  biomarkers of childhood obesity risk that predate the influence of the obesogenic environment  will contribute to an improved understanding of the neurological underpinnings of obesity, early  identification of at-risk individuals, and intervention targets for primary prevention.",Human Newborn Energy Homeostasis Brain Networks And Infant Adiposity,9959421,R21DK118578,"['Address', 'Age', 'Anatomy', 'Back', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Birth Weight', 'Body Composition', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cholesterol', 'Cost efficiency', 'Data', 'Data Element', 'Deltastab', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diet', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Digestive System Disorders', 'Disease', 'Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Early identification', 'Elements', 'Endocrine', 'Environment', 'Equilibrium', 'Exhibits', 'Fatty acid glycerol esters', 'Fiber', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Genetic Risk', 'Gestational Age', 'Glucose', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Growth', 'HDL-triglyceride', 'Health', 'Homeostasis', 'Human', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Image', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Infant', 'Inflammatory', 'Insulin', 'Interleukin-6', 'Intervention', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Link', 'Lipids', 'Logic', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Metabolic', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Mothers', 'Neurologic', 'Neurosciences', 'Newborn Infant', 'Nonesterified Fatty Acids', 'Obesity', 'Outcome', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Physical activity', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention strategy', 'Primary Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Satiation', 'Scientific Advances and Accomplishments', 'Shapes', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'System', 'TNF gene', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Triglycerides', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain circuitry', 'clinically significant', 'connectome', 'design', 'developmental plasticity', 'disorder risk', 'early childhood', 'energy balance', 'feeding', 'fetal', 'fetal programming', 'follow-up', 'gestational weight gain', 'gray matter', 'improved', 'infancy', 'infant adiposity', 'inter-individual variation', 'interest', 'neonatal magnetic resonance imaging', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'obesity in children', 'obesity risk', 'obesogenic', 'obstetrical complication', 'postnatal', 'predictive modeling', 'prenatal', 'prenatal stress', 'prepregnancy', 'programs', 'prospective', 'random forest', 'response', 'secondary analysis', 'sex', 'vector', 'white matter']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R21,2020,158513,0.06890628846123198
"Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development ABSTRACT Opioid use during pregnancy has increased dramatically in the past decade, and may pose significant health challenges for the rapidly growing number of exposed infants born to mothers using illicit and/or prescribed opioids. Prenatal opioid exposure (OE) is inconsistently related to impaired neurobehavior, attention, and cognition in infancy and childhood, suggesting persistent, potentially life-long, consequences. This fetal exposure occurs during a time of extraordinary brain growth and organization, making it a critical period of vulnerability to environmental insult. However, little is known about the effects of OE on early human brain development that may contribute to reported deficits. The objectives of this proposal are to quantify the effects of OE on the development of infant brain functional connectivity in postnatal months 1-12, to determine associations with neurobehavioral and cognitive outcomes, and to examine how gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and postnatal environmental factors moderate these effects. Our central hypothesis is that fetal brain development and organization are altered by OE; deficits in developing connections and networks mediate the negative effects of OE on simultaneously developing neurobehavior and early cognition; gender, other drugs and postnatal environment interact with OE to influence growth trajectories of rapidly developing connections and networks that subserve emerging abilities. This hypothesis is based on the study team’s substantial research experience with mother-infant dyads with prenatal opioid and other drug exposures (Jones, Grewen), and on strong preliminary data showing normative development of functional networks from birth to 2 years (Gao), disruptions in neonatal functional connectivity due to prenatal opioids and other drugs (Grewen, Gao), and on associations between functional connections and behavioral effects (Grewen, Gao). The rationale for the proposed research is that longitudinal study will quantify direct and interactive effects of initial neural insult, infant gender and postnatal environment on developing functional connections. The hypotheses will be tested with 3 Specific Aims: 1) Quantify the extent to which OE impairs developing functional connections at 2 weeks and again at 12 months; 2) Determine the extent to which the effects of OE on neurobehavior, attention, self-regulation and cognition are related to developmental trajectories of functional connections; 3) Determine how infant gender, other prenatal drug exposures, and a Cumulative Environmental Risk Index moderate the effects of OE on developing connectivity. This approach is innovative because it will employ hypothesis-driven analyses as well as novel, exploratory data-driven and machine learning methods to quantify direct and interactive effects of OE and other drug exposures on functional circuitry. The proposed research is significant because rates of prenatal OE and NAS have increased 5-fold since 2000, in parallel with the opioid epidemic, and because knowledge gleaned has potential to identify factors that may protect or further harm growing functional networks underlying nascent cognitive abilities in this at-risk group. NARRATIVE The proposed research will provide currently unavailable knowledge of the effects of prenatal opioid and other drug exposures on developing brain functional connections and networks that subserve emerging behaviors and cognition in the first year of life, and will shed light on modifiable postnatal factors that may enhance or further impair early brain development. At a broader level, this work is relevant to understanding brain mechanisms underlying developing attention/arousal systems and how these brain-behavior connections may be altered by biological or environmental challenges. It is relevant to public health because the number of women using opioids during pregnancy is rapidly growing, in parallel with the current opioid epidemic. This research is relevant to NIDA’s mission because it seeks to identify the physiological and social substrates and mechanisms involved in the cognitive and behavioral effects produced by drugs of abuse in an exceptionally vulnerable population--infants exposed in utero.",Effects of Prenatal Opiates on Infant Brain and Neurobehavioral Development,9954064,R01DA043678,"['Alcohols', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Animals', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Arousal', 'Attention', 'Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Brain Stem', 'Buprenorphine', 'Calcarine Sulcus', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Cocaine', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dorsal', 'Drug Exposure', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Female', 'Fetal alcohol effects', 'Gender', 'Glean', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Human', 'Impairment', 'Impulsivity', 'Infant', 'Infant Development', 'Informal Social Control', 'Insula of Reil', 'Knowledge', 'Language', 'Lateral', 'Life', 'Light', 'Link', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Marijuana', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Methadone', 'Mission', 'Mothers', 'Motor', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neonatal', 'Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome', 'Nicotine', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Opioid agonist', 'Outcome', 'Perinatal', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Physiological', 'Postpartum Period', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnant Women', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Second Pregnancy Trimester', 'Structure', 'System', 'Temperament', 'Testing', 'Thalamic structure', 'Time', 'Ventral Tegmental Area', 'Visual', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual attention', 'Vulnerable Populations', 'Woman', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'cingulate cortex', 'cognitive ability', 'critical period', 'drug of abuse', 'emotion regulation', 'executive function', 'experience', 'fetal', 'fetal drug exposure', 'fetal opioid exposure', 'illicit opioid', 'imaging modality', 'in utero', 'indexing', 'infancy', 'innovation', 'intraparietal sulcus', 'joint attention', 'machine learning method', 'male', 'motor control', 'neonate', 'neurobehavior', 'neurobehavioral', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'offspring', 'opioid epidemic', 'opioid exposure', 'opioid use', 'opioid use in pregnancy', 'postnatal', 'prenatal', 'prenatal exposure', 'prescription opioid', 'relating to nervous system', 'resilience', 'response', 'sex', 'social', 'standard of care', 'visual control', 'visual motor', 'white matter']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,690910,0.035585174303711324
"India ENIGMA Initiative for Global Aging & Mental Health ABSTRACT Our revised proposal launches the India ENIGMA Initiative for Global Aging & Mental Health - a globally coordinated study of brain aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD), created response to the NIH FOA: Global Brain and Nervous System Disorders Research Across the Lifespan (R01; PAR-18-834; https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-18-835.html). Our overall goal is to identify predictive markers in the blood, genome, and epigenome that influence brain aging in India, to better understand prognosis, and to support personalized risk evaluations on each continent. We plan to identify etiological pathways to resilience using the rich biobanking strategy developed by our partners at NIMHANS in India. To do this, we will leverage our global consortium, ENIGMA (http://enigma.ini.usc.edu), to partner with dementia research pioneers in India, creating new links between international biobanks, and building research capacity. By 2020, 70% of the world's population over age 60 will live in developing countries, with 14% in India (Mathuranath 2012). Recently, attention has been drawn to a “diversity” crisis in brain research, as most brain research is conducted in Caucasian populations from relatively wealthy backgrounds (LeWinn 2017). This lack of ethnic diversity means that: (1) we do not know if predictors of health (and disease) generalize to other ethnic groups, and (2) we fail to collect vital data that could teach us how AD progresses in populations with different genetic and environmental backgrounds. Our coordinated analyses in US/EU and Indian biobanks will help identify brain aging predictors specific to India and those that are universal. Specifically, we will: Aim 1. Create Lifespan Charts of brain aging Trajectories in India using MRI, DWI and Resting State Functional MRI. Aim 2. Identify Blood and Epigenetic Markers that Predict Brain Aging and AD in India. Aim 3. Using a combination of multimodal imaging, blood markers, and clinical data to predict clinical decline in India. We test structural equation models that hypothesize how brain aging depends on lifestyle and psychosocial factors (diet, family support, drug abuse, literacy, sleep, and depression), as well as sex, education, and AD genetic risk. With novel machine learning methods, will analyze blood markers and plasma proteomic analytes, to define processes that are harmful to brain aging. In Capacity Building Aims, we will leverage ENIGMA's successful strategies to train emerging and established scientists in India to analyze their data with high quality control and precision, with targeted biostatistical and imaging workshops to bolster capacity. This collaborative India-US initiative will enable future science initiatives, and equip the NIMHANS team with the necessary tools to train new scientists and independently conduct high impact research bridging efforts into numerous international partnerships.

"Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry ABSTRACT Major psychiatric illnesses are increasingly understood as disorders of brain development, which has led to large-scale studies of youth that combine multi-modal neuroimaging with clinical phenotyping. Together, such data have emphasized the promise of objective ‘growth charts’ of brain development. However, synergies across major efforts remains unrealized due to use of different clinical instruments, different scanning protocols, challenges in informatics, and difficulties in data integration. In this proposal, we will overcome these obstacles by leveraging advances in multivariate harmonization and analysis techniques to build highly reproducible growth charts of human brain development. To do this, we will aggregate and harmonize eight existing large-scale developmental imaging studies, comprising over 10,000 participants between the age of 5- 24 (Aim 1). We will use this harmonized data to build generalizable indices of normal network brain development (Aim 2). Finally, developmental abnormalities within specific brain networks will be linked to dimensions of psychopathology (Aim 3). Critically, all code, data, and derived indices will be shared publicly, creating a massive new resource to accelerate research in the developmental neuroscience community (Aim 4). In sum, this proposal will have provide a new data resource, yield reproducible growth charts of brain development, and delineate novel mechanisms regarding the developmental basis of psychopathology in youth. RELEVANCE Psychiatric illnesses often begin in childhood, adolescence, or young adulthood, and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. Reproducible growth charts of bran development are critical for understanding both normal brain development and abnormalities associated with diverse psychopathology. Early interventions crafted using these growth charts would benefit the public health by reducing the huge disability associated with psychiatric disorders and limiting the costs to society at large.",Reproducible imaging-based brain growth charts for psychiatry,10001025,R01MH120482,"['Address', 'Adolescence', 'Age', 'Base of the Brain', 'Bayesian Method', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Categories', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Data Aggregation', 'Data Analytics', 'Data Collection', 'Data Pooling', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Docking', 'Early Intervention', 'Failure', 'Fright', 'Functional Imaging', 'Grain', 'Growth', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Image', 'Informatics', 'International', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Mental Health', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Participant', 'Phenotype', 'Process', 'Properdin', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rest', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sex Differences', 'Site', 'Societies', 'Structure', 'Sum', 'Symptoms', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Youth', 'aging brain', 'anxious', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'clinical phenotype', 'computing resources', 'cost', 'data archive', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'data resource', 'design', 'disability', 'externalizing behavior', 'image processing', 'imaging study', 'indexing', 'insight', 'instrument', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'portability', 'quality assurance', 'response', 'segregation', 'serial imaging', 'sex', 'somatosensory', 'synergism', 'theories', 'young adult']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2020,724789,0.04884165241665642
"Non-invasive Neuromodulation Unit (NNU) Work was conducted under clinical protocols NCT03065335 and NCT03289923. Major accomplishments for the NNU were the recruitment of additional staff, continuing to acquire research data in our collaboration with the Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch (ETPB) and expanding that collaboration to a second study recently launched, continuing our multimodal protocol in combined TMS and talk therapy, installation and testing of neuromodulation equipment including robotic coil placement for precision cortical targeting, expanding our training of staff to include additional labs at NIH as a core function, and expanding our healthy volunteer protocol for TMS tool development. We now have two fully functional noninvasive neuromodulation laboratories operating in the Clinical Center and are actively enrolling subjects in IRB approved trials.  Training in the safe and effective delivery of neuromodulation is one of our major functions as a Service within the Center for Multimodal Neuroimaging. We continue to provide in-service training on TMS safety, including hands-on training sessions covering the following procedures: Motor threshold determination, electromyography (EMG), Neuronavigation, simultaneous TMS/EEG to measure TMS-evoked potentials, TMS-Safety procedures, and the role of Nursing in TMS and patient management.  Our projects fall into 3 themes: 1) measuring neuroplasticity, 2) modulating neuroplasticity, 3) modeling the effects of neuromodulation and mining multi-modal datasets to discover biomarkers of rapid antidepressant response. Our projects include:  Theme I: Measuring Neuroplasticity  Mechanisms of Rapid Antidepressant Action collaboration with Drs. Zarate and Park o This project develops biomarkers of rapid antidepressant response through the addition of TMS-EMG, TMS-EEG neuroplasticity measures to the existing intramural research program on ketamine.  Concurrent fMRI-guided rTMS and cognitive therapy for the treatment of major depressive episodes o This project (which also incorporates Theme II, below) uses MEG (in collaboration with Allison Nugent (ETPB)), fMRI, and TMS/EEG to measure brain network engagement and neuroplastic changes due to multimodal TMS/CBT in depressed adults.  Theme II: Modulating Neuroplasticity  We are taking complementary approaches to modulating neuroplasticity: 1) seizure-induced neuroplasticity, 2) paired associative stimulation (PAS) and 3) novel tool development to extend the spatial and temporal specificity of noninvasive neuromodulation.  Next generation seizure therapy collaboration with Drs. Zarate, Park, Bikson, Datta o Therapeutically induced seizures exert rapid antidepressant action and are robust inducers of neurotrophic factors and neurogenesis. New technologies for focal seizure induction may improve the risk/benefit ratio by lowering cognitive side effects, and also provide the valuable scientific opportunity to examine common mechanisms across rapidly acting interventions such as ketamine. o This project involves optimization of seizure therapy dosing, through the study of individualized low amplitude seizure therapy (iLAST), comprised of focal seizure induction with minimal current exposure to improve tolerability of seizure therapy for depression.  Cognitive Paired Associative Stimulation (C-PAS) o PAS has been shown to strengthen synaptic efficacy within a circuit through repeated co-activation and coincident firing. We extend that approach to activate a targeted neural circuit through cognitive task performance, and couple that with simultaneous focal neuromodulation to enhance plasticity, as a means of enhancing circuit function and improving the functional-specificity of neuromodulation action. One of our projects employs fMRI-guided TMS paired with a specific form of cognitive behavioral therapy for the treatment of depression (in collaboration with Dr. Strauman). Another of our projects, being conducted in the form of a cooperative agreement (5U01AG050618) uses fMRI-guided TMS with simultaneous working memory training to enhance executive function in older adults (in collaboration with Drs. Appelbaum, Peterchev, and Cabeza).  Novel Tool Development TMS research has been slowed due to two fundamental problems that directly impact its usefulness. First, the space of parameters used to produce TMS is immensely large and has barely been explored. Second, the interaction of any set of TMS parameters with any individual brain is poorly understood, and this has led to unpredictable efficacy and a large amount of inter-individual variability in TMS studies. The purpose of this technical development protocol is to address these two fundamental deficiencies. Our ongoing projects within this healthy volunteer protocol include:  1. Controlling ongoing cortical state during NIBS with neurofeedback. This study asks: Does controlling brain states using neurofeedback result in greater intra- and inter-individual variability in responses to TMS? The aim is to explore the use of neurofeedback to control brain state, using EEG to evaluate the cortical response to single pulses of TMS while subjects are controlling the electrophysiological state of their brain.  2. Parametric studies to optimize theta-burst stimulation (TBS). While patterned stimulation such as TBS may represent a more potent form of TMS, its effects are quite unreliable between subjects. Moreover, there has not been a parametric examination of the stimulation parameters used in TBS. We have begun with the intertrain interval as the first parameter to examine, with the aim to parametrically measure its effects on TBS response.  3. Noninvasive focal deep brain stimulation (nfDBS) We seek to establish whether TMS can reach, in a dose-dependent way, a targeted subcortical region transynaptically which is too distant for effective direct TMS stimulation, using TMS as a probe of the fronto-striatal network, a key circuit implicated in reward processing. This will be tested with the perturbation-imaging procedure of TMS/fMRI interleaving, i.e. while participants receive TMS during both resting state and task-based fMRI.  4. Transcranial direct current stimulation to reduce effects of nicotine withdrawal syndrome NIDA Protocol 12-DA-N474 (PI: E.A.Stein, collaborators: Sarah Aronson) Symptoms of nicotine withdrawal remain a major impediment for smokers trying to quit, with most quit attempts failing within the first week of abstinence when withdrawal symptoms are at their height. Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) has the potential to modify neuronal circuits by application of a subthreshold conductive current through the scalp. The goal is to investigate the effects of tDCS on modulating large-scale brain networks dysregulated in nicotine addiction and withdrawal.  5. Closed-loop paired associative stimulation The effects of noninvasive brain stimulation can be extremely variable across subjects. One source of this variability is known to be the state of the brain at the time of stimulation. One way of addressing this source of variability is to trigger the TMS when the brain is in an up-state or a down-state. To accomplish this, real-time signal processing is utilized to analyze the EEG and predict where the brain oscillations will be milliseconds in advance. The TMS trigger is controlled by the real-time hardware.   Theme III: Modeling Neuroplasticity / Mining Multi-Modal Datasets  Our team comprises engineering expertise to perform in silico modeling of the spatial and temporal effects of neuromodulation on neuronal function, and to apply machine learning and graph theoretical approaches to data-mining and hypothesis generation to support the discovery of common mechanisms across rapidly acting antidepressant interventions. n/a",Non-invasive Neuromodulation Unit (NNU),10266628,ZIAMH002955,"['Abstinence', 'Address', 'Adult', 'Antidepressive Agents', 'Base of the Brain', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Cognitive', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Collaborations', 'Corpus striatum structure', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Depressed mood', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Distant', 'Dose', 'Economic Burden', 'Elderly', 'Electroconvulsive Therapy', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromyography', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Engineering', 'Enrollment', 'Equipment', 'Evoked Potentials', 'Exposure to', 'Focal Seizure', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Height', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Institutional Review Boards', 'Intervention', 'Intramural Research Program', 'Investigational Therapies', 'Ketamine', 'Laboratories', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Mining', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Motor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neuronavigation', 'Neurons', 'Neurosciences', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nicotine Withdrawal', 'Nurse&apos', 's Role', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Pre-Clinical Model', 'Procedures', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Psychopharmacology', 'Psychotherapy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Rest', 'Robotics', 'Safety', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Services', 'Short-Term Memory', 'Smoker', 'Source', 'Specificity', 'Substance Withdrawal Syndrome', 'Symptoms', 'Synapses', 'Task Performances', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Training', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'U-Series Cooperative Agreements', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Withdrawal Symptom', 'Work', 'base', 'brain behavior', 'clinical center', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'cognitive task', 'data analysis pipeline', 'data mining', 'design', 'disability burden', 'electric field', 'executive function', 'falls', 'healthy volunteer', 'image guided', 'improved', 'in silico', 'inter-individual variation', 'magnetic field', 'magnetic seizure therapy', 'millisecond', 'mind control', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'neural circuit', 'neurofeedback', 'neurogenesis', 'neuroimaging', 'neuronal circuitry', 'neurophysiology', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurotrophic factor', 'new technology', 'next generation', 'novel', 'procedure safety', 'protocol development', 'recruit', 'response', 'reward processing', 'risk benefit ratio', 'side effect', 'signal processing', 'single episode major depressive disorder', 'therapy development', 'tool', 'tool development']",NIMH,NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH,ZIA,2020,3434711,-0.028794940077178522
"New Photo-Acoustic Imaging Process in Fetal Monitoring to Dramatically Reduce Brain Injuries in Newborns PROJECT SUMMARY Summary The Brimrose Technology Corporation and Johns Hopkins University are forming a powerful new team to make a new instrument that has the potential to dramatically reduce a major global health problem–perinatal hypoxic- ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)–by enabling early detection during labor. HIE caused by asphyxia is a leading cause of infant fatalities as well as a source of cerebral palsy and other long-term severe neurologic impairments. The medical community has been limited in early diagnosis of HIE because current fetal heart rate monitoring has poor specificity. If identified early, HIE can be treated effectively with therapeutic hypothermia. We are proposing a fetal photoacoustic monitoring system that measures oxyhemoglobin saturation of the sagittal sinus vein draining the fetal cerebral cortex during labor. Sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation decreases to very low levels when placental gas exchange is impaired (hypoxia) and/or when fetal cerebral perfusion pressure falls (ischemia). The photoacoustic instrument transmits light through the open fontanelle or bone and into cerebral veins and tissue where ultrasound waves are generated. Using near- infrared incident light at discrete wavelengths that are absorbed preferentially by oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin, ultrasound detected on the fetal scalp at each wavelength can estimate oxyhemoglobin saturation. Brimrose has constructed a novel ultrasound detection technology with sensitivity orders of magnitude greater than the current best-use piezo-electric sensors. This will permit the use of low-power LED light sources rather than cumbersome laser lights now employed, thereby avoiding safety goggle use and promoting greater deployment. The Hopkins team has already validated the ability of a standard photoacoustic system to accurately estimate sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation through the skull of newborn piglets. The purpose of Phase I is to demonstrate the feasibility of using safe, low power LED light sources with the new ultrasensitive ultrasound sensor to detect critically low sagittal sinus oxyhemoglobin saturation when oxygenation is manipulated. The platform will be based on in-silico simulation to optimize the acoustic and optical pathways for the skull and brain. Real-time measurements on a time scale of seconds will inform the obstetric caregiver of dynamic fluctuations of brain oxygenation during contractions. The Phase II goal is to make a miniaturized photoacoustic device prototype that can report on fetal brain oxygenation. We believe the resulting instrument will provide early detection brain HI with greater specificity and sensitivity, enabling early intervention and treatment and is potentially transferrable to a commercial model for manufacture. PROJECT NARRATIVE The Brimrose Technology Corporation and the Johns Hopkins University propose making a new instrument to potentially dramatically reduce the incidence of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), which can result in mortality or lifelong disabilities. Our goal is to develop an intrapartum fetal brain monitor using photoacoustics with inexpensive, safe and clinically convenient light emitting diodes (LEDs) to noninvasively and instantaneously identify the fetus at risk for brain injury.

"Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging Project Summary. Neuroimaging is poised to take a substantial leap forward in understanding the neurophysiological underpinnings of human behavior, due to a combination of improved analytic techniques and the quality of imaging data. These advances are allowing researchers to develop population-level multivariate models of the functional brain representations underlying behavior, performance, clinical status and prognosis, and other outcomes. Population-based models can identify patterns of brain activity, or `signatures', that can predict behavior and decode mental states in new individuals, producing generalizable knowledge and highly reproducible maps. These signatures can capture behavior with large effect sizes, and can be used and tested across research groups. However, the potential of such signatures is limited by neuroanatomical constraints, in particular individual variation in functional brain anatomy. To circumvent this problem, current models are either applied only to individual participants, severely limiting generalizability, or force participants' data into anatomical reference spaces (atlases) that do not respect individual functional topology and boundaries. Here we seek to overcome this shortcoming by developing new topological models for inter-subject alignment, which register participants' functional brain maps to one another. This will increase effective spatial resolution, and more importantly allow us to explicitly analyze the spatial topology of functional maps make inferences on differences in activation location and shape across persons and psychological states. We will test and validate the methods using a purpose-designed experiment (n = 120) that includes two types of naturalistic narrative experiences (movies and audio stories) and tasks from three functional domains (pain, emotion, and cognition). The tasks are designed with several constraints in mind, including: (1) systematic coverage of cognitive, emotional, and sensory tasks matched in stimulus properties (e.g., stimulus duration); and (2) multiple levels of task demand within each task, to permit parametric modeling and prediction of demand levels. We will compare our new methods to existing methods based on out-of-sample effect sizes in predicting behavior and test-retest reliability. We will make the analytic methods, software, and dataset available to other researchers, along with a library of functional reference spaces for multiple psychological states. Project Narrative. We develop new methods for enhancing the development of models that can predict behavior, clinical status, and other outcomes using neuroimaging data. Successful development will help improve the translational impact of neuroimaging. It will also contribute to developing multidisciplinary neuroscience, by promoting the development of neural signatures for specific mental processes in humans with increased precision and specificity.",Individualized spatial topology in functional neuroimaging,9908089,R01EB026549,"['Affective', 'Anatomy', 'Atlases', 'Behavior', 'Brain', 'Charon', 'Clinical', 'Cognition', 'Cognitive', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Emotional', 'Emotions', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Gaussian model', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Individual Differences', 'Knowledge', 'Libraries', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Mental Processes', 'Methods', 'Mind', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Outcome', 'Pain', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sampling', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Specificity', 'Stimulus', 'Sum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Wages', 'Work', 'affective neuroscience', 'analytical method', 'base', 'behavior prediction', 'behavior test', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'design', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'mental state', 'model development', 'movie', 'multidisciplinary', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroimaging', 'neurophysiology', 'outcome forecast', 'population based', 'predictive modeling', 'psychologic', 'statistics', 'translational impact']",NIBIB,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,667005,0.025591388784918585
"Building analysis tools and a theory framework for inferring principles of neural computation from multi-scale organization in brain recordings Summary The BRAIN initiative is enabling ground-breaking techniques for brain recordings that will permit a unique view onto the dynamics of neural activity. However, inferring brain function from multi-channel physiological recordings is challenging. A key difficulty is that individual neurons and mesoscopic, often rhythmic, cell populations interact in complicated and recurrent ways. Such complex neuronal dynamics is hard to analyze but very likely important to the functioning of the brain. This proposal will address this problem by developing (1) tools for analyzing brain activity; (2) a theoretical framework for expressing underlying computations and generating experimental predictions. The starting point of the project is our earlier discovery that phase structure in oscillatory local field potentials (LFP) of hippocampal areas CA1/CA3 carry location information in exquisite detail (Agarwal et al. 2014). We will release software tools that make the methods for phase decoding and extracting meaningful LFP components available to the broader community. Further, in collaboration with experimental labs we will research the mechanistic underpinnings of this discovery in hippocampus (Buzsaki NYU, Foster, UC Berkeley), and explore how similar approaches can leverage phase diversity in cortical gamma oscillations (Fries, MPI Frankfurt). The research goal is to develop analysis tools for decoding and extraction of functional components (Aims 1 and 2), applicable to a broad range of multivariate brain recordings of hippocampal and cortical activity. Further, we will develop a flexible two-level theory framework with software tools (Aim 3) to help neuroscientists, in particular experimenters, to formulate putative abstract computations underlying a brain function under study, and build a concrete mechanistic circuit model of those computations. The computational description level will leverage ideas of vector symbolic architectures, a class of connectionist models originally proposed for describing cognitive reasoning (Plate, 1995; Kanerva, 1996). Models produced by the software tool will concisely encapsulate assumptions about the computation and its implementation of a brain function and produce predictions that can be tested in a next generation of recording experiments.

"Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks The mammalian brain is believed to be optimally designed for robust and adaptable computation of the sensory inputs from the world, with respect to both its hardware (network structure) and software (network dynamics). The precise connections between the intricate structural connectivity and the rich network dynamics, however, are yet unknown. Moreover, our understanding of how the network structure and dynamics shape (or are shaped by) underlying coding principles in the brain network, is limited. My research plan proposes to close this gap by leveraging rich dataset obtained by state-of-art experimental techniques at the Allen Institute for Brain Science and innovative mathematical methods.  Specifically, my project aims to 1) link network structure and dynamic information processing in the brain, and to 2) bridge the gap between detailed biophysiological mechanisms and overarching neural coding principles with a focus on predictive coding theory, using data-driven mathematical models. To address Aim 1, I will investigate how network dynamics measured by synchronizability, metastability, and integrated information depend on local and global structure of the network. I will then study whether the experimentally obtained mouse brain connectome has optimal connectivity structures for unique dynamical characteristics. These analyses will be extended to the cell-type and layer-specific brain connectivity, based on the latest Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity data obtained from Cre-transgenic mice. During the independent phase, I will investigate whether brain-like networks can be evolved from optimization of dynamic measures. Regarding Aim 2, I will analyze data obtained from my current collaborative project which experimentally tests predictive coding models in the mouse visual cortex. In this study, we measure neural activity in response to expected and unexpected sequences of natural stimuli across three hierarchically related areas. Upon completion of the experiments, during the mentored phase, I will investigate mapping of algorithmic units in predictive coding models to neuronal populations in different layers. During my independent career period, I will extend the predictive coding model to incorporate active sensing and thalamo-cortical circuitries.  The project during the mentored phase will be carried out at the University of Washington which provides a highly interdisciplinary environment and offers the ideal training for me to become an independent researcher. I will also have access to rich resources and outstanding collaborators at the Allen Institute for Brain Science. I will have two mentors, one from the University of Washington and another from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. This unique setup will allow me to study mathematical models based on experimental data obtained by cutting-edge techniques with guidance from mentors with strong theoretical backgrounds. With theories closely tied to experiments, I believe my proposed project will contribute to our understanding of the connection between structure and computation of the neuronal network, addressing BRAIN initiative’s high priorities. The proposed research aims to probe how adaptable sensory coding arises from intricate connectivity structure and dynamics of the brain network at multiple scales. This study will contribute to our understanding of connections between unique structure and dynamics of the brain network as well as the mapping of complex neuronal dynamics in the cortical circuitry to algorithmic nodes in predictive coding models. By combining cutting-edge experimental and theoretical tools, this project will contribute to identifying fundamental principles underlying emergence of cognition and perception from neuronal network dynamics.","Bridging structure, dynamics, and information processing in brain networks",10000156,K99EY030840,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'BRAIN initiative', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Characteristics', 'Code', 'Cognition', 'Complex', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Computer software', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Graph', 'Image', 'Institutes', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Motivation', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Output', 'Perception', 'Phase', 'Population', 'Process', 'Property', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Sensory', 'Shapes', 'Signal Transduction', 'Space Perception', 'Stimulus', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Theoretical Studies', 'Training', 'Transgenic Mice', 'Universities', 'Visual Cortex', 'Visual system structure', 'Washington', 'Work', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'career', 'cell type', 'cognitive control', 'collaborative environment', 'connectome', 'design', 'experimental study', 'flexibility', 'information processing', 'innovation', 'mathematical methods', 'mathematical model', 'member', 'neural network', 'neuronal circuitry', 'object recognition', 'predictive test', 'relating to nervous system', 'response', 'sensory input', 'sensory stimulus', 'sensory system', 'theories', 'tool']",NEI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K99,2020,128619,0.027038612351685858
"Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method of focally stimulating the brain that uses electromagnetic induction and does not require surgery. There is optimism that TMS will revolutionize how we treat neurological and psychiatric disorders, evidenced by over 1000 clinical trials registered using TMS. Much of this optimism stems from the successful use of TMS as a treatment for depression. Despite the large number of clinical trials using TMS the number of therapeutic indications has been stagnant, limited to major depression and more recently obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are fundamental questions about the underlying mechanisms of action for TMS that will be critical to understand in order to advance this treatment modality. Here, we propose a unique collaborative project between neurology and neurosurgery that will allow an unprecedented window into understanding how TMS impacts the human brain. Specifically, we will perform TMS in neurosurgical patients with intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) monitoring to record real time effects of TMS on local and remote brain areas with an unparalleled combination of spatial and temporal resolution relative to other human studies. We have already demonstrated the safety of this approach using a gel-based phantom brain and have results from seven patients demonstrating safety and preliminary results. For the current proposal we aim to: 1) characterize the response of TMS on the human brain as recorded from iEEG between active and sham conditions, and 2) relate remote electrophysiological responses induced by TMS to measures of brain connectivity between the stimulation and recording sites assessed with resting state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI). This will allow us to evaluate the relationship between TMS-evoked iEEG responses and the strength of functional connectivity to the stimulation site in a regression model. We hypothesize that: 1) TMS will have focal effects detected from surface electrodes underlying the stimulation site as well as network-level engagement detected at remote sites, 2) Repetitive TMS will induce frequency- specific effects that differ between 0.5 and 10 Hz stimulation protocols, and 3) the magnitude of repetitive TMS-evoked iEEG responses across electrodes will relate to the strength of rs-fcMRI between the stimulation and recording sites. By investigating the electrophysiological responses of TMS with high spatiotemporal precision in humans, this study will provide new mechanistic insights into the effects of TMS on target engagement and relate these findings to imaging methods already in widespread use. Moreover, the TMS will be applied in a clinically meaningful way by targeting the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in a protocol used to treat depression. Generating results for these aims will be key to advancing our understanding of how TMS engages brain networks, which can be leveraged to rationally develop personalized, imaging-guided therapeutic TMS for depression and other disorders. PROJECT NARRATIVE This research will help our understanding of how transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) affects the brain. We will develop a new method of measuring TMS-induced changes in brain activity with high spatial and temporal accuracy that is only possible with intracranial recording. The research will shed light on the mechanism of TMS and facilitate the development of better interventions and treatments for psychiatric diseases.",Investigating the Effects of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Intracranial EEG in Humans,9971584,R21MH120441,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Area', 'Attenuated', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electrodes', 'Electroencephalography', 'Electromagnetics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Frequencies', 'Gel', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurology', 'Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Publications', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Rest', 'Safety', 'Site', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'base', 'cingulate cortex', 'cranium', 'field study', 'human subject', 'image guided', 'imaging modality', 'innovation', 'insight', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuroregulation', 'neurosurgery', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'optimism', 'programs', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'response', 'spatiotemporal', 'standard measure', 'stem', 'temporal measurement', 'tool']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2020,193125,0.03618059096801615
"Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging PROJECT SUMMARY Prevalent, morbid, and costly ($66 billion/year in 2007), incontinence is a major problem, especially for older adults, in whom the most common type is urgency incontinence (UUI). Generally ascribed to bladder spasms, UUI's actual causes are unknown, and therapy remains inadequate. Recent data suggest that one cause is poor bladder control by the brain. In our recent R01 we used biofeedback (BFB) as a probe to explore this. The exciting findings suggest that one `phenotype' of UUI in older adults seems to be caused by a breakdown in brain control, which can be restored by successful behavioral therapy, while another is refractory. Our proposed new study will explore this further by attempting to differentiate the mechanisms associated with disease and aging. The goal is to identify which brain mechanisms should be suppressed because they are contributing to or causing UUI, which should be enhanced because they are helping to compensate for UUI, and which should be ignored because they are incidental to aging and not related to UUI. Current data suggest that bladder control comprises 3 cerebral circuits that maintain continence by suppressing the voiding reflex in the midbrain. In our UUI phenotype that responded to BFB, the mechanism involved enhancing deactivation of the first brain circuit (medial prefrontal cortex, mPFC) which resulted in less activation of the second circuit (which includes the midcingulate cortex). In the phenotype that was resistant to BFB, no brain changes were seen. Yet, although we have an emerging picture of the brain's role in UUI, we have only rudimentary understanding of what is `normal', i.e. how the brain normally controls the bladder. More relevant, we do not know whether this control mechanism is the same across the lifespan, or if it changes owing to the impact of aging. Thus, our overall aim is to characterize continence control in both young and old people, and examine how changes due to bladder control failure differ in each age group. Our specific aims are to characterize normal voiding in the continent old and young in order to better understand and verify the working model and to use the comparison to older adults with UUI to understand the mechanism of brain failure in these individuals. To address these aims, we will conduct a detailed clinical and neuroimaging study to study 80 asymptomatic women and 80 UUI women, each group divided equally into young (18-45) and old (65+ years). The study will enable us to evaluate the changes in brain structure and function and to identify brain mechanisms involved in continence control, changes due to aging (both benign and contributory to UUI), and changes due to disease. The study will provide the comprehensive data on brain mechanisms involved in the normal continence mechanism in order to better corroborate our working model, understand the aging process, and assess targets for therapy. It will thereby enable scientists to develop novel and more effective new therapies based on the revolution in neuroscience—and more hope for UUI sufferers. PROJECT NARRATIVE Urge urinary incontinence is a common problem in older people which vastly reduces quality of life, yet the cause and mechanism of disease are not well understood. This study will characterize brain control of the bladder in young and old continent individuals and age-matched wet counterparts. This will expand our current knowledge of how the brain controls the bladder, better characterize the `ideal' mechanism and suggest ways in which we can better target treatment.",Investigation of brain mechanisms involved in the Urinary Continence mechanism associated with aging,10050097,R01AG065288,"['Address', 'Age', 'Aging', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Benign', 'Biofeedback', 'Bladder', 'Bladder Control', 'Bladder Dysfunction', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Cerebrum', 'Clinical', 'Complement', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Elderly', 'Failure', 'Functional Imaging', 'Goals', 'High Prevalence', 'Incidence', 'Incontinence', 'Individual', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Medial', 'Mediating', 'Micturition Reflex', 'Midbrain structure', 'Modeling', 'Neurosciences', 'Phenotype', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Premenopause', 'Process', 'Quality of life', 'Reaction', 'Refractory', 'Research Personnel', 'Resistance', 'Role', 'Scientist', 'Spasm', 'Structure', 'Therapeutic', 'Urge Incontinence', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Woman', 'age group', 'age related', 'aged', 'analytical method', 'base', 'brain abnormalities', 'brain dysfunction', 'cohort', 'cost', 'improved', 'innovation', 'micturition urgency', 'mind control', 'neuroimaging', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'predicting response', 'recruit', 'research clinical testing', 'response', 'side effect', 'targeted treatment', 'treatment response', 'young adult']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2020,624134,0.0002612941670920181
"CRCNS: Common algorithmic strategies used by the brain for labeling points in high-dimensional space The first major goal of this work is to learn how certain brain regions (olfactory system,  hippocampus, and cerebellum) learn very complex stimuli that employ a combinatorial code to  identify stimuli as points in a high-dimensional space. For example, the simple fruit fly  olfactory system uses the firing rates of 50 different types of odorant receptors to  identify each odor by placing it at a point in a SO-dimensional space. Although the fly olfactory  system is well understood, less is known about analogous regions in vertebrate brains, and our  goal is to begin to learn about these other regions. The first step is to start with the mouse olfactory system that is similar to the fly in some ways but has complexities that are  absent in insects. These complexities include an enhanced ability to handle noise in the  odor and to learn over time to discriminate between very similar odors (e.g., two types of  red wines). Preliminary evidence shows that it should be possible to learn the role of  these complexities in vertebrate olfaction. The research design involves studying the  anatomy and recording the firing rates of different types of neurons at different levels of the  mouse olfactory system and in applying computational methods and algorithms that have  proved successful in earlier work to describe these complexities. The second major goal is to use insights into how these brain regions operate to improve the  function of computer algorithms. For a long time, a dream of many neuroscientists and computer  scientists has been to understand how the brain works well enough that we could translate insights  from the brain to improve machine computation. Indeed, experience has shown that the brain   has evolved novel variations of information processing algorithms used by computer  scientists to solve general computational problems. With sufficient insight into algorithms  used by the brain, these insights may provide unexpected ways to improve the function computer  science algorithms. Further, understanding the circuit mechanisms involved in olfactory processing can help illuminate the basis of a variety of smell disorders, and may  in the future lead to the construction of artificial smelling devices. Our main goal is to understand what computations are used by the mammalian olfactory system; this  has two types of public relevance. First, we hope to learn what circuit mechanisms are used in  this brain region, which may help identify how disruption of these mechanisms causes  brain and olfactory malfunction. Second, we hope to improve computer performance by using insights into how the brain computes.",CRCNS: Common algorithmic strategies used by the brain for labeling points in high-dimensional space,9994975,R01DC017695,"['Algorithm Design', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Benchmarking', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Burn injury', 'Cells', 'Cerebellum', 'Chemicals', 'Code', 'Coffee', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computers', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data Set', 'Devices', 'Dimensions', 'Discrimination', 'Dreams', 'Drosophila genus', 'Face', 'Feedback', 'Fire - disasters', 'Fruit', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Insecta', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mammals', 'Modification', 'Mus', 'Neurons', 'Neurophysiology - biologic function', 'Noise', 'Odorant Receptors', 'Odors', 'Olfaction Disorders', 'Olfactory Pathways', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Population', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Psychological reinforcement', 'Research Design', 'Role', 'Science', 'Scientist', 'Series', 'Smell Perception', 'Stimulus', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral response', 'combinatorial', 'computational basis', 'computer science', 'experience', 'experimental study', 'fly', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'improved functioning', 'information processing', 'insight', 'learning community', 'neural circuit', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'preservation', 'red wine', 'response', 'theories']",NIDCD,COLD SPRING HARBOR LABORATORY,R01,2020,446764,0.03945145278092779
"Structural Development of Human Fetal Brain Abstract Despite its critical significance, little is known about the most dynamic phase of brain development in infancy: 0-2 years. To change the status quo, comprehensive and quantitative infant brain atlases as reference standards for precision health are needed. In addition, diffusion MRI (dMRI) has entered a new era in which dynamic cortical internal microstructural complexity, indexed by e.g. cortical mean kurtosis derived from diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), can be studied in the living infant brain noninvasively using more advanced multi-shell dMRI. Furthermore, multi-modality measures offer unparalleled insights into mechanistic structure- function and structure-behavior relationships. Work in the current cycle has focused on structural development of human fetal and preterm brains. Based on high resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 150 brains, we have established the atlases and quantified cortical microstructure with cortical fractional anisotropy, validated by histological images and correlated with transcriptomic (RNA) expression. Building upon this work, in the next cycle, we will focus on brain development in infancy, immediately after the fetal period. Specifically, the goal is to establish next-generation dMRI atlases (quantitative UPenn-CHOP infant brain atlases) and to harness a more advanced cortical microstructural mean kurtosis measurement by delineating its 4D spatiotemporal frameworks as well as uncovering its relationship to brain function and behavior during infancy (0-2 years). 160 typically developing infants at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24 months will be recruited. Advanced “connectome-quality” multi-band high-resolution multi-shell dMRI, resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and structural MRI will be acquired. High-quality whole-head magnetoencephalography (MEG) will also be acquired. Anatomical labels of all 122 major gray and white matter structures will be built up based on high contrasts from DTI-derived maps. The measurements of DTI-derived metrics will be used for the quantitative components of DTI atlases and age-dependent white matter tract trajectories (Aim 1). Mean kurtosis of the 4th order kurtosis tensor has been shown to be sensitive to cortical internal microstructural changes of infant brains. The spatiotemporal sensitivity of mean kurtosis measures to infant age and cortical region will be investigated (Aim 2). Furthermore, we will establish mechanistic structure-function relationships with multi- modality imaging, including not only multi-shell dMRI, but also rs-fMRI and MEG, all optimized for infant brains (Aim 3). The quantitative infant brain atlases and normal developmental trajectories will provide reference standards for “pre-“diagnostic risk assessment, filling a gap towards precision health for infants (e.g. Z-score maps). Infant cortical microstructure will be delineated noninvasively with 4D spatiotemporal frameworks. With multi-modality strength, the fundamental structure-function and structure-behavior mechanistic relations will set the stage for understanding aberrant brain development in neurodevelopmental disorders such as autistic spectrum disorder and intellectual disabilities in general.

"Towards integrated 3D reconstruction of whole human brains at subcellular resolution Project Summary A detailed understanding of the anatomical and molecular architectures of brain cells and their brain-wide organization is essential for interrogating human brain function and dysfunction. Extensive efforts have been made toward mapping brain cells through various lenses, which have established invaluable databases yielding new insights. However, integrative extraction of the multimodal properties of various cell-types brain-wide within the same brain, crucial to elucidating complex intercellular relationships, remains nearly impossible. We have developed high-throughput, cost-effective technology platforms to create a fully integrated three-dimensional (3D) human brain cell atlas by simultaneously mapping high-dimensional features (e.g., spatial, molecular, morphological, and microenvironment information) of all cells acquired from the same whole brain. The proposed work will establish the most comprehensive 3D human brain map to date, with unprecedented resolution and completeness. We envision that this atlas will facilitate the integration of a broad range of studies and allow the research community to interrogate human brain structure and function at multiple levels. In Aim 1, we will apply a novel technology to transform whole human brain tissue into indestructible hydrogel–tissue hybrids that allow highly multiplexed molecular labeling and subcellular-resolution volume imaging. In Aim 2, we will apply scalable labeling and imaging technologies to map the brain-wide 3D distribution of various cell-type and structural markers at subcellular resolution within the same brain. Our chemical engineering–based approach to this aim will enable cost-effective, lossless 3D labeling of the entire human brain at lower cost as traditional subsampling approaches. True volume labeling and subcellular-resolution imaging will allow us to extract fine morphological and connectivity information from labeled cells and reconstruct the microenvironment of all cells. In Aim 3, we will use a host of rapid and highly automated algorithms to perform unbiased, integrative high- dimensional phenotyping of all cells based on their spatial location, molecular expression, morphology, and microenvironment. In Aim 4, we will perform super-resolution phenotyping of cells in a selected brain region from the same sample used in Aim 3 to map inter-areal axonal connectivity at single-fiber resolution and to characterize chemical synapses. This integrative approach will likely unveil unique cell-types and brain regions, a crucial step toward a better understanding of brain function. The complete 3D dataset will be linked to magnetic resonance and diffusion spectrum images and existing reference atlases to facilitate the integration of a wide breadth of study at multiple levels and to make the data publicly accessible for mining and analysis. A detailed picture of the human brain’s complex intermolecular, intercellular, and interareal interactions is of paramount importance for understanding its function and dysfunction. However, the immense complexity of the human brain and the absence of enabling technologies have hither-to made it impossible to interrogate these interactions brain-wide.

"Stress-Induced Hormonal Fluctuations and their Relation to Seizure Dynamics in Children with Epilepsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In the new era of personalized medicine, the epilepsy field is at a tipping point to leverage emerging therapies that can being tailored to individual patient characteristics. Over 30% of children with epilepsy suffer from seizures that cannot be managed by mono- or poly-pharmacotherapies. Targeted neurostimulation and drug delivery are promising alternative therapies but, given the complexity and heterogeneity of the disorder, these therapies need to be precisely guided by the patient’s seizure dynamics. Despite decades of basic and clinical research, the latter remain elusive. In particular, seizure evolution from ictogenesis to ictal onset is poorly understood, in part due to a lack of fundamental understanding of how seizure precipitants impact the brain’s neurophysiological equilibrium, trigger ictogenesis and lead to cumulative changes that facilitate ictal onset. Although the underlying mechanisms of action of common precipitants such as stress and sleep loss are unclear, there is substantial evidence that they may modulate various hormones and neurotransmitters that impact the brain’s excitability and/or balance between excitation and inhibition. This project aims to systematically investigate the impact of large-scale hormonal fluctuations in pediatric epilepsy patients on brain dynamics, and quantify localized and distributed (network-level) electrophysiological changes during seizure evolution. Specifically, in a cohort of n = 40 patients with focal epilepsy who are undergoing continuous noninvasive neurophysiological monitoring as part of their presurgical evaluation, salivary cortisol and catecholamines will be measured 8 times daily, across all study days (Aim 1). Continuous scalp electroncephalograms (EEG) collected during this period will be analyzed in their entirety at the signal and network levels (Aim 2). Pathological high-frequency oscillations, a promising precursor of seizure activity in the epileptic brain will be estimated and classified across the entire period of recording. Multiscale brain networks and their topological properties will be quantified across all dominant frequencies of continuous EEG signals, and their time-dependent seizure sensitivity and specificity will be assessed. Statistical models will be developed to evaluate the relation between each patient-specific circadian hormone rhythms and corresponding temporal patterns of estimated electrophysiological measures, individually and combined into a seizure risk score (Aim 3). This is a first of its kind study that may significantly improve the field’s understanding of the direct and indirect (through hormonal modulations) impact of seizure precipitants, such as stress, on seizure dynamics from ictogenesis to ictal onset. This new knowledge may have a significant impact on the development of next-generation therapies that need to be guided by patient-specific seizure dynamics. PROJECT NARRATIVE Through repeated hormone measurements and continuous electrophysiological (scalp EEG data), this project aims to systematically investigate the impact of (predominantly stress-related) hormonal fluctuations on the pediatric epileptic brain and their relationships to seizure evolution, from ictogenesis to ictal onset. The overarching goal of the study is to improve the field’s fundamental understanding of mechanisms underlying electrophysiological changes in the epileptic brain that favor seizure generation. In turn, this knowledge may have a transformative impact on promising next- generation individualized therapies for patients with medically refractory epilepsy.",Stress-Induced Hormonal Fluctuations and their Relation to Seizure Dynamics in Children with Epilepsy,10105451,R03NS119799,"['Alternative Therapies', 'Basic Science', 'Brain', 'Catecholamines', 'Characteristics', 'Child', 'Childhood', 'Clinical Research', 'Data', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Delivery Systems', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Endogenous Factors', 'Environment', 'Epilepsy', 'Epinephrine', 'Equilibrium', 'Evaluation', 'Evolution', 'Exogenous Factors', 'Frequencies', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'High Frequency Oscillation', 'Hormonal', 'Hormonal Change', 'Hormones', 'Hour', 'Hydrocortisone', 'Impact Seizures', 'Individual', 'Inpatients', 'Intractable Epilepsy', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Longevity', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurable', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Menstruation', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Neurotransmitters', 'Norepinephrine', 'Partial Epilepsies', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Polynomial Models', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention', 'Property', 'Quality of life', 'ROC Curve', 'Risk', 'Safety', 'Salivary', 'Salvelinus', 'Sampling', 'Scalp structure', 'Seizures', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sleep Deprivation', 'Statistical Models', 'Stress', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Variant', 'Work', 'childhood epilepsy', 'circadian', 'cognitive development', 'cognitive function', 'cohort', 'curve fitting', 'effective therapy', 'functional outcomes', 'improved', 'individual patient', 'individualized medicine', 'learning network', 'neurophysiology', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'personalized medicine', 'signal processing', 'targeted treatment', 'time use']",NINDS,BOSTON CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R03,2020,177000,-0.02776291177205336
"Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers Project Summary/Abstract  The brain is extremely complex as we know, and involves a complicated interplay between functional infor- mation interacting with a structural (but not static) substrate. Brain imaging technology provides a way to sample various aspects of the brain albeit incompletely, providing a rich set of multitask and multimodal information. The field has advanced significantly in its approach to multimodal data, as there are more studies correlating, e.g. functional and structural measures. However, the vast majority of studies still ignore the joint information among two or more modalities or tasks. Such information is critical to consider as each brain imaging modality reports on a different aspect of the brain (e.g. gray matter integrity, blood flow changes, white matter integrity). The field is still striving to understand how to diagnose and treat complex mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, and others, and ignoring the joint information among tasks and modalities misses a critical, but available, part of the puzzle. Combining multimodal imaging data is not easy since, among other reasons, the combination of multiple data sets consisting of thousands of voxels or timepoints yields a very high dimen- sional problem, requiring appropriate data reduction strategies. In the previous phase of the project we devel- oped advanced approaches to capture high-dimensional relationships among 2 or more modalities. Our work continues to strongly support the benefits of multimodal data fusion to both provide a more complete picture of brain function and structure, but also to improve our ability to study and predict the impact of complex mental illness. In this new phase of the project, we will focus on methods that can fill some existing gaps, such as the ability to bridge spatial/temporal as well as structural/functional connectivity scales. We also propose a novel framework to integrate unimodal and multimodal features called chromatic fusion, which searches for combina- tions of multimodal `notes' which occupy a unique position in a latent (or dictionary) space. The proposed meth- ods will be validated using simulations, hybrid-data, and large N normative imaging data. Our proposed approach will be thoroughly tested using this large data set which includes multiple illnesses that have overlapping symp- toms and which can sometimes be misdiagnosed and treated with the wrong medications for months or years (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and unipolar depression). We will provide open source tools and release data throughout the duration of the project via GitHub and the NITRIC repository, hence enabling other investigators to compare their own methods with our own as well as to apply them to a large variety of brain disorders. 37 Project Narrative  The promise of multimodal imaging is clear, and our work has clearly shown the substantial benefits of ex- tracting multimodal features estimated jointly from the data. In this renewal, we focus on some key understudied areas including fusing across vast spatiotemporal and functional/structural connectivity scales as well as devel- oping powerful new frameworks for integrating the resulting information to enable decision making and enable identification of potential targets for further study or possible treatment. Completion of our aims will result in a powerful new toolkit for data fusion of multimodal brain imaging data. 36",Multivariate methods for identifying multitask/multimodal brain imaging biomarkers,10058554,R01EB006841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Blood flow', 'Brain', 'Brain Diseases', 'Brain imaging', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Dictionary', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Documentation', 'Electroencephalography', 'Evaluation', 'Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Hybrids', 'Image', 'Imaging technology', 'Intuition', 'Joints', 'Link', 'Measurable', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Moods', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Psychotic Disorders', 'Pythons', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Rest', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Source', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Unipolar Depression', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'blind', 'clinical care', 'clinical phenotype', 'data fusion', 'data reduction', 'deep learning', 'design', 'feature extraction', 'gray matter', 'high dimensionality', 'imaging biomarker', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'large datasets', 'multimodal data', 'multimodality', 'multiple datasets', 'multitask', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'next generation', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'patient subsets', 'potential biomarker', 'repository', 'simulation', 'spatiotemporal', 'tool', 'translational impact', 'user friendly software', 'user-friendly', 'white matter']",NIBIB,GEORGIA STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,542808,0.05410027135307439
"Integrating neuroimaging and brain gene expression for functional characterization of psychiatric GWAS PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mental disorders are complex, debilitating health conditions, yet the neurobiological causes and pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these disorders are not well understood. The emergence of large- scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has enabled identification of significant, reliable genetic associations to mental disorders. However, it has been difficult to translate GWAS loci into specific causal driver variants/genes to extract mechanistic insights for identifying actionable targets for therapeutic interventions. Neurobiological intermediate phenotypes (NBIPs) are invaluable in understanding the brain’s structural and functional correlates of elevated risk of psychopathology, although the underlying processes and molecular mechanisms for observed NBIPs are elusive. Recent advances in genetic-based imputation now allow one to infer genetically-regulated portions of intermediate phenotypes from genome-wide genotype data. Our research team has successfully employed brain-specific transcriptomic imputation approaches across mental disorders to identify novel genes and pathways of risk. In this proposal, we seek to increase the biological resolution of the link between neuroimaging genetics and psychiatric genetics by creating novel polygenic models of multimodal neuroimaging based on brain-specific gene expression that can be applied to psychiatric GWAS. In Aim 1, we will generate brain transcriptomic predictive models of multimodal neuroimaging and replicate them in independent datasets. In Aim 2, we will conduct Imaging Transcriptome-wide Association Studies (ITWAS) to identify neuroimaging associations with mental disorders at a brain-specific gene-level and distinguish the causal ones. Our integrative analyses will enhance our understanding of NBIPs and mental disorder risk; thus, they will provide mechanistic insights that may drive identification of novel diagnostic, trans-diagnostic and treatment approaches. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mental disorders have substantial morbidity and mortality, contributing to devastating emotional, social and financial tolls on sufferers and their families. We will study the genetic risk architecture of mental disorders, with a focus on the expressed portion of the human genome and imaging of the brain. We will use computational models, based on brain gene expression, to predict the genetic component of brain imaging of hundreds of thousands of people to better understand the mechanisms that give rise to these disorders.",Integrating neuroimaging and brain gene expression for functional characterization of psychiatric GWAS,10057769,R21MH121909,"['Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Brain', 'Brain imaging', 'Brain region', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Emotional', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Family', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mediation', 'Mental disorders', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Neurobiology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders', 'Process', 'Psychopathology', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Signal Transduction', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Models', 'Structure', 'Syndrome', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'base', 'biobank', 'brain tissue', 'connectome', 'disorder risk', 'genetic association', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'human imaging', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'neuroimaging', 'neuropsychiatry', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'novel strategies', 'predictive modeling', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'social', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'targeted treatment', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptomics']",NIMH,MCLEAN HOSPITAL,R21,2020,451000,0.02353248509300447
"High throughput assaying of circuit activity and connectivity in brain organoids Experimental models of the human developing brain are needed to investigate human-specific aspects of brain development, evolution, and neurological disease. Progress in the field has been hampered by the lack of models, considering that the endogenous developing human brain cannot be directly investigated; animal models often fail to recapitulate human disorders and cannot feasibly be used to study complex polygenic states spanning many genes. While reductionist in nature, stem-cell derived 3D human brain organoids offer a first-of- its-kind opportunity to study processes of human brain formation and wiring that are otherwise not accessible. However, there is an unmet need for organoid models that are cellularly complete and reproducible and for methodology to decode the establishment, connectivity and dynamics of neural circuits in organoids, at scale and with high fidelity. If we could map the activity and connectivity of organoids at scale, both to understand circuit function/dysfunction and to guide further development of organoids, we could close the loop on organoid design and application. Towards this goal, we have developed many molecular and imaging tools for high-throughput analysis of neural activity and connectivity, which we propose to apply to new, next-generation organoid models. Here, we propose a collaborative approach among four groups (Arlotta - brain organoids and human brain development; Boyden - circuit physiology and neural imaging technology; Lewis - material science and bioengineering and Insoo Hyun- bioethics) to pioneer a robust organoid system that combines the development of vascularized brain organoids incorporating more complete cell diversity and maturation with advanced high-throughput functional molecular and imaging tools to enable interrogation of circuit activity, connectivity, and molecular changes in cells participating in physiologically relevant circuits. We will build on a highly reproducible brain organoid model that we recently developed to promote the generation of cell types that are currently absent in organoids but needed for circuit maturation, refinement, and functionality. This work is intended to generate more advanced organoid models designed to promote maturation and robust network activity. In parallel, we will develop a pipeline to record neural activity from intact organoids using all- optical-electrophysiology techniques at scale, and optimize epitope-based barcoding and expansion microscopy to enable molecularly-annotated connectomics of brain organoids. The work proposed here will enable the use of human organoid models to study human circuit formation, plasticity, and function, analyses that are currently hampered by the lack of technologies and assays for high-throughput measurements of circuit physiology and connectivity in organoids. Beyond the work proposed here, these methods will directly enable investigation into how disease states alter information processing in the brain; for example, linking mutations in disease-associated genes with specific abnormalities in human neurons and circuits to inform the identification of molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Project Narrative  Neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders affect millions worldwide and are of enormous public health significance; however, we have a very limited understanding of the molecular, cellular and circuit-level abnormalities underlying these diseases. Progress in the field has been hampered by the lack of research models, given that animal models often fail to recapitulate the human disease, and that, while 3D human brain organoids offer experimental access to processes of human brain formation and wiring, methodology is needed to decode circuit function and connectivity in organoids, at scale and with high fidelity. We propose here to pioneer the development of next-generation, vascularized brain organoids and to apply novel, scalable molecular and imaging tools to enable investigation of human neural circuits in health and disease.",High throughput assaying of circuit activity and connectivity in brain organoids,10049677,RF1MH123977,"['3-Dimensional', 'Affect', 'Animal Model', 'Antibodies', 'Architecture', 'Bar Codes', 'Bioethics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biomedical Engineering', 'Blood Vessels', 'Brain', 'Cell model', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Complex', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Electron Microscopy', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epitopes', 'Ethics', 'Evolution', 'Experimental Models', 'Functional disorder', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Health', 'Human', 'Imaging Device', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Imaging technology', 'Interneurons', 'Investigation', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Microglia', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Neurons', 'Oligodendroglia', 'Optics', 'Organoids', 'Pattern', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Science', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Work', 'automated algorithm', 'base', 'cell type', 'collaborative approach', 'design', 'high throughput analysis', 'high throughput screening', 'human disease', 'information processing', 'materials science', 'model design', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular scale', 'molecular targeted therapies', 'myelination', 'nervous system disorder', 'neural circuit', 'neuronal cell body', 'neuropsychiatric disorder', 'neurotransmission', 'next generation', 'novel', 'patch clamp', 'relating to nervous system', 'spatiotemporal', 'stem cells', 'synaptic pruning']",NIMH,HARVARD UNIVERSITY,RF1,2020,2509021,0.032646056564881565
"Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks We propose to develop an implantable brain stimulation system to measure and control oscillatory local field potential (LFP) synchrony within brain networks. Implantable neurotechnologies like deep brain stimulation (DBS) have revolutionized the treatment of movement disorders and epilepsy. DBS has some clinical signal in psychiatry as well, but individual trial results are highly variable. We have argued that this is a target engagement problem – that the high-frequency constant stimulation used in Parkinson’s or other tremor disorders is not the right approach to the circuits of mental illness. Instead, we believe the correct approach is to identify signatures of healthy communication in these circuits/networks, then design stimulation protocols that specifically produce those signatures. LFP synchrony is likely one of those communication signatures. Across multiple domains of cognitive and emotional function, behavioral performance (a read-out of successful network communication) improves when brain regions show synchronous (coherent) LFP oscillations. Further, clinically effective DBS, in movement and psychiatric disorders, is associated with changes in LFP synchrony. Co-PI Widge has developed algorithms that specifically control inter-regional LFP synchrony, by locking electrical stimulation pulses in one region to the phase of an ongoing oscillation in another region. The translational challenge is that efficient, implantable real-time synchrony monitoring and phase-locked stimulation require signal processing capabilities not found in any existing or anticipated device. Co-PI Shoaran has developed power-efficient phase estimation circuits, specifically optimized for DBS- like implants. We propose to combine these approaches. Aims 1 and 2 will develop a new application- specific integrated circuit (ASIC) that integrates Dr. Shoaran’s measurement and neural decoding frameworks with Dr. Widge’s oscillation-control methods. We will validate this circuit’s recording and phase-locking capabilities in vivo in Dr. Widge’s rodent lab. In Aim 3, a world-leading contract implant manufacturer (Cirtec) will integrate that new ASIC into a packaged, implant-ready device ready for large animal safety testing. Cirtec has already developed a DBS prototyping platform optimized to get new therapies more quickly into first-in- human, allowing us to greatly accelerate the path to the clinic and reduce regulatory risk. At the end of 5 years, we will either be ready for that clinical pilot or have only modest safety testing remaining. Our team has expertise in electronics, medical device fabrication, clinical brain stimulation, and technology commercialization. The work will be headquartered in Minnesota’s “Medical Alley”, an epicenter of medical device innovation. We are well-qualified to execute these Aims and bring the resulting technology to market. Success would yield a new implant optimized for network monitoring and therapy, a powerful new tool for both psychiatric treatment and cutting-edge neuroscience research. Project Narrative We will develop a new implantable medical device for treating severe psychiatric illness, especially mood and anxiety disorders. Many, if not all, of these disorders arise from communication failure in distributed brain networks, networks that communicate through rhythmic, oscillatory firing of large groups of brain cells. Our device will implement new algorithms that measure and control that rhythmic firing, restoring patterns of healthy communication.",Implantable Neurostimulators for Control of Oscillatory Brain Networks,10034533,R01MH123634,"['Algorithms', 'Animal Testing', 'Anxiety Disorders', 'Area', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Budgets', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communication', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'Contracts', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Deep Brain Stimulation', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Electric Stimulation', 'Electronics', 'Electrophysiology (science)', 'Epilepsy', 'Equipment', 'Failure', 'Frequencies', 'Future', 'Human', 'Implant', 'Individual', 'Laboratory Animals', 'Machine Learning', 'Manufactured form', 'Manufacturer Name', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medical', 'Medical Device', 'Medical Device Designs', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Minnesota', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Mood Disorders', 'Movement Disorders', 'Neurosciences', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Output', 'Parkinson Disease', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Periodicity', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psychiatric therapeutic procedure', 'Psychiatry', 'Rattus', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Rodent', 'Seizures', 'Signal Transduction', 'Speed', 'Structure', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Time', 'Translating', 'Tremor', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analog', 'animal safety', 'base', 'brain cell', 'brain dysfunction', 'cognitive function', 'cognitive neuroscience', 'commercialization', 'conditioning', 'design', 'digital', 'emotional functioning', 'first-in-human', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'industry partner', 'innovation', 'nanofabrication', 'neural circuit', 'neurotechnology', 'novel strategies', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'prototype', 'psychiatric symptom', 'relating to nervous system', 'safety testing', 'signal processing', 'success', 'tool', 'translational neuroscience', 'trigonometry']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,885873,0.02599881551912748
"Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma Project Summary Childhood trauma dramatically increases the risk of adult psychiatric illness and significantly alters symptom complexity and treatment outcomes. Discovering causal factors and novel interventions could have a dramatic impact on treating psychiatric illness. Over the past decade, there has been a growing appreciation for the role of the gut microbiota in normal brain development and behavior and of critical modulatory effects of the gut microbiota on mental health. Interactions of microbiota with stress-related hormonal, immune, and inflammatory processes in the brain are particularly well supported. Thus, there is intense interest in understanding how interactions among stress, microbiome, and brain (the “stress-biome-brain” axis; SBB) contribute to a significant impact on mental health. We will address the hypothesis that adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. First, we will characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics in mice following recurrent trauma. Mice exposed to recurrent predation stress or to control conditions will be assessed for changes in the gut microbiota, hippocampal gene expression, and behavior. We will use these data to construct multi-level models and predict causal interactions among stress, microbiome, brain, and behavior. Next, we will test the hypothesis that changes in the gut microbiota induced by childhood trauma have causal effects in the brain. We will perform fecal transplants from trauma-exposed mice into naïve mice and measure changes in brain gene expression. These experiments will be performed in a germ-free mouse facility in mice with a small specified number of species, for precise control of microbial content. In addition, we will test strategies for perturbation of the microbial community and to assess behavioral outcomes in the germ-free facility. The data generated will set the stage for precision perturbation studies of the microbiota and its effects on behavior and for future translational studies. Project Narrative Adolescent trauma-induced alterations in the microbiome may contribute to the neurobiological and behavioral disruptions seen in adulthood. We will conduct experiments designed to characterize stress-biome-brain axis dynamics using state of the art genomics and systems biology. The results will provide a ranked list of the factors predicted to drive neuronal and behavioral responses across the system and will form the framework to test their causality.",Modeling the stress-biome-brain axis in the consequences of early life trauma,9936242,R21MH118597,"['16S ribosomal RNA sequencing', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Adverse effects', 'Age', 'Animals', 'Behavior', 'Behavior assessment', 'Behavioral', 'Brain', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Data', 'Development', 'Early-life trauma', 'Etiology', 'Exposure to', 'Faculty', 'Foundations', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Germ-Free', 'Hippocampus (Brain)', 'Hormonal', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Institutes', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Maryland', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medicine', 'Mental Health', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Moods', 'Mus', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Neurons', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Peripheral', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Predatory Behavior', 'Predictive Factor', 'Process', 'Psychiatry', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Stress', 'Symptoms', 'System', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Transcript', 'Trauma', 'Trauma recovery', 'Treatment outcome', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral response', 'brain behavior', 'comparative', 'design', 'experimental study', 'fecal transplantation', 'genome sciences', 'gut microbiome', 'gut microbiota', 'gut-brain axis', 'improved', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'interest', 'machine learning algorithm', 'microbial', 'microbial community', 'microbiome', 'microbiome alteration', 'microbiota', 'mouse model', 'multilevel analysis', 'network models', 'neurodevelopment', 'neuroinflammation', 'novel', 'outcome prediction', 'pediatric trauma', 'programs', 'psychologic', 'resilience', 'synergism', 'translational study', 'trauma exposure', 'working group']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2020,192828,0.04518365764093664
"Mapping human brain perivascular space in lifespan using human connectome project data PROJECT SUMMARY Perivascular spaces are a critical component of the glia-lymphatic circuit, facilitating the clearance of soluble waste. The role of perivascular spaces and changes in the brain’s clearance system in normal development, aging, and cognition is not fully understood, mainly due to lack of neuroimaging capabilities. However, noninvasive in vivo mapping of the perivascular space fluid with high accuracy and reliability is now made possible with our recent analytical developments, using human connectome project (HCP) data. The objective of this project is to map structural and diffusion features of perivascular space fluid across lifespan. PVS features include PVS presence (e.g., count and volume fraction) and diffusion (e.g., diffusivity and anisotropy). These features will be extracted regionally and globally across the brain. Structural MRI will provide information regarding localization and extent of the PVS and diffusion MRI will be used to investigate biophysical properties of the PVS fluid and surrounding tissue. The central hypothesis is that the perivascular space fluid increases across lifespan. We also hypothesize that individual differences exist in perivascular spaces as a function of demographic, general health and lifestyle health choices, such as body mass index, blood pressure, tobacco use and sleep quality. The central hypothesis will be tested by characterizing the normative map of the perivascular space fluid across the lifespan and in relation to various demographic, cognitive measures, and health factors. We will also examine whether subjects neuro-behavioral performances can be predicted by perivascular space features. We will pursue these aims by applying innovative MRI-based computational techniques that we recently developed and optimized on HCP data. We will also use Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Studies to build first normative template of PVS in neurodevelopment. Together, our findings will ultimately allow for a better understanding of the human brain clearance system, and our shared perivascular space mapping workflow can provide a resource for researchers to study a wide range of neurological conditions. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is expected to fill our gap knowledge regarding the role of the clearance system in brain health and cognition and its neuroimaging signature. We will identify and provide access to quantitative morphological and diffusion features of brain glia-lymphatic network to the larger scientific community to help facilitate our understanding of what role the brain clearance system has across lifespan.

"Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue Project Summary / Abstract  Central nervous system infections with RNA viruses cause severe neurological deficits and death, and are extremely challenging to diagnose. This multiple PI proposal presents an innovative research program that will provide the foundation for a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline to rapidly diagnose RNA virus infections from surgical brain biopsies. The investigators will combine two cutting-edge techniques for viral detection, screening with double-stranded RNA immunohistochemistry (dsRNA IHC) to identify cases with a high likelihood of a viral etiology, and unbiased metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for specific virus identification and genome analysis.  To develop the dsRNA IHC screening assay, six commercially available anti-dsRNA antibodies will be optimized in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissue and evaluated in a series of known infectious and non-infectious cases. The top candidates will be tested in a set of brain biopsies with inflammation of unclear etiology and compared to results of mNGS performed in parallel. The development of this assay will facilitate efficient screening of FFPE tissue samples from patients with neurological disease of unclear pathogenesis to identify those with a high likelihood of viral etiology. To improve mNGS methods for FFPE brain tissue, new laboratory techniques will be tested to increase the yield and quality of viral RNA extracted. In addition to virus identification, mNGS will be used to perform full-genome deep sequencing of viruses. These results can be applied to molecular epidemiology, disease surveillance, and understanding pathogen-host interactions. Overall, this project will enhance our understanding of RNA viruses that cause CNS infection, inform future studies of virus evolution and pathogenesis, and lay the foundation for the development of a comprehensive viral diagnostics pipeline that will substantially improve the care of patients with devastating CNS infections. This work aligns very well with the NINDS mission to seek and apply fundamental knowledge of the brain to reduce the burden of neurological disease.  This R21 Exploratory Neuroscience Research Grant proposal will support and expand the collaboration between the two PIs. The unique combination of expertise in neuropathology, infectious disease pathology, virology, clinical infectious disease, and metagenomic sequencing demonstrate the requisite skills and perspective needed to achieve the goals of this proposal. The stimulating environments of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard University, and Emory University are extremely well suited to the proposed research plan, which not only provide critical equipment and facilities infrastructure, but also mentorship, formal opportunities to present and discuss results, and eventual venues to implement this clinical testing prospectively. Project Narrative Viral infections of the central nervous system cause significant illness and death, and in many patients the specific virus causing infection is never found. This project will develop new tools to detect viruses in brain tissue, including previously unknown viruses, and sequence their genomes. The objectives of this project are to improve diagnostics for patients with devastating neurological illness, and to open new research directions in studying viruses that cause central nervous system infection.",Developing a robust platform to identify unexpected and novel viruses in human brain tissue,10105533,R21NS119660,"['Adenoviruses', 'Algorithms', 'Antibodies', 'Applications Grants', 'Arboviruses', 'Bacteria', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Assay', 'Biopsy', 'Brain', 'Case Study', 'Central Nervous System Infections', 'Central Nervous System Viral Diseases', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Cytoplasmic Inclusion', 'DNA Viruses', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Double-Stranded RNA', 'Encephalitis', 'Enterovirus', 'Environment', 'Equipment', 'Etiology', 'Evolution', 'Exhibits', 'Formalin', 'Foundations', 'Freezing', 'Future', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Herpesviridae', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Hospitals', 'Human', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Inflammation', 'Inflammatory', 'Infrastructure', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mentorship', 'Metagenomics', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Molecular Target', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurologic', 'Neurologic Deficit', 'Neurologic Symptoms', 'Neurosciences Research', 'Nodule', 'Nuclear Inclusion', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathology', 'Patient Care', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Probability', 'Proteomics', 'RNA Virus Infections', 'RNA Viruses', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Ribosomal RNA', 'Sampling', 'Screening procedure', 'Series', 'Shotgun Sequencing', 'Specimen', 'Suggestion', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissue Embedding', 'Tissue Sample', 'Universities', 'Viral', 'Viral Genome', 'Virus', 'Virus Diseases', 'Woman', 'Work', 'assay development', 'base', 'brain tissue', 'cost', 'cross reactivity', 'deep sequencing', 'fungus', 'genome analysis', 'genome sequencing', 'human pathogen', 'improved', 'innovation', 'metagenomic sequencing', 'multimodality', 'nervous system disorder', 'neuropathology', 'next generation sequencing', 'novel virus', 'pathogen', 'programs', 'prospective test', 'rRNA Genes', 'rapid diagnosis', 'research clinical testing', 'screening', 'skills', 'tool', 'viral RNA', 'viral detection', 'viral genomics', 'virology', 'virus identification', 'whole genome']",NINDS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R21,2020,480375,-0.05687902488432704
"Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The main theme of this proposal is the identification of brain signatures associated with hedonic eating behaviors (HEB) and the role of inflammatory mediators in shaping these brain signatures. I will also evaluate the feasibility of using a targeted intervention (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy [CBT]) to counteract the hypothesized alterations within the extended reward network in this subgroup of obese subjects. This area of study is significant because increases in the hedonic component of food intake, which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, are likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals, but the mechanisms that bias the brain towards this alteration in ingestive behavior are incompletely understood. Here I will use inflammatory gene expression profiles to show that adverse experiences alter brain signatures within the extended reward network through the process of neuroinflammation. The proposal begins by characterizing brain signatures related to HEB. Then gene expression profiles as measured by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma cytokines are identified and correlated with brain signatures and HEB. CBT will be used to investigate the therapeutic effect linked to strengthening inhibitory influences of prefrontal regions within the extended reward network, and reducing increased sympathetic nervous system modulation of the immune system, thereby offering a cost effective way of counteracting HEB. Advanced and sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques will be used to integrate the data from multiple neuroimaging sources, gene profiles, and behavioral data in order to determine the unique variance of adverse environmental factors in determining signatures associated with HEB. This may serve as a sensitive measure of central biomarkers in obesity related to HEB. A model that accounts for sex and race differences will increase the validity of the model, and will help identify disadvantaged groups who are at increased risk for obesity associated with HEB. I have a background in psychology and seek the following training goals from this award: (1) knowledge in the pathophysiology of obesity; (2) genomic analysis techniques including bioinformatics techniques; (3) knowledge and expertise in metabolomics data analysis; (4) specific expertise in diffusion tensor MRI analysis; (5) advanced data driven multivariate techniques using topological network and system biological analytical techniques (e.g. cluster and classification analysis); and (6) expertise in applying behavioral therapy to obesity. The work environment at the Center for Neurobiology of Stress provides an excellent infrastructure for training in neuro-genetic investigations of obesity. I will attend courses, workshops, and meetings in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological sequelae of obesity. Regular individual and group meetings with mentors (Mayer [primary], Pisegna, Li, Cole, Labus, Naliboff [co-mentors]) have been set up. I plan to apply for a R03 grant by Year 3 and a R01 grant by Year 5. Long term, I plan to establish an independent research career in brain-gut interactions associated with health disparities in obesity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    With obesity becoming a major health epidemic in the United States, and with concerns being raised about the validity and effectiveness of obesity treatments, this project investigates increases in the hedonic related food addiction component of food intake which are no longer driven by homeostatic needs, and are thus likely to play an important pathophysiological role in some obese individuals. In order for effective and personalized obesity treatments to be developed for hedonic ingestion, this project addresses a comprehensive biopsychosocial bidirectional brain-immune mechanistic model that characterizes the influence of adverse environment factors on prefrontal inhibitory control of brain signatures in the extended reward network, while accounting for sex and race differences. Using advanced automated and mathematical analytic techniques allows to integrate information from multimodal neuroimaging data and metadata sets (genomics, clinical behaviors, psychosocial environmental factors), in order to provide a powerful and sensitive biomarker that will increase biological readouts of hedonic eating behaviors and thus bring to the forefront those disadvantaged groups and individuals who are at increased risk for this type of obesity",Role of Inflammatory Processes in Reward Network Alterations in Obesity,9897563,K23DK106528,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Adult', 'Adverse event', 'American', 'Amygdaloid structure', 'Anatomy', 'Anterior', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents', 'Area', 'Award', 'Behavior', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Behavioral', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cognitive Therapy', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Diet', 'Diffusion', 'Disadvantaged', 'Disease', 'Eating', 'Eating Behavior', 'Educational workshop', 'Effectiveness', 'Emotions', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemic', 'Expression Profiling', 'Feeding behaviors', 'Food Intake Regulation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Group Meetings', 'Health', 'Hypothalamic structure', 'Immune', 'Immune system', 'Individual', 'Inflammation Mediators', 'Inflammatory', 'Ingestion', 'Insula of Reil', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Link', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mathematics', 'Measures', 'Mentors', 'Metadata', 'Modeling', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Neurobiology', 'Neuronal Plasticity', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Obesity', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Peripheral', 'Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell', 'Pharmacological Treatment', 'Plasma', 'Play', 'Process', 'Property', 'Psychology', 'Race', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Rest', 'Rewards', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Satiation', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Source', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'Subgroup', 'Substance abuse problem', 'Sympathetic Nervous System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Effect', 'Thinness', 'Training', 'Training and Infrastructure', 'Transcriptional Regulation', 'United States', 'Up-Regulation', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'adult obesity', 'bariatric surgery', 'base', 'behavior measurement', 'biological systems', 'biopsychosocial', 'brain shape', 'career', 'cost effective', 'cytokine', 'early life adversity', 'emotion regulation', 'emotional eating', 'food addiction', 'food craving', 'global health', 'gut-brain axis', 'health disparity', 'hedonic', 'immunoregulation', 'indexing', 'machine learning algorithm', 'meetings', 'metabolomics', 'mind control', 'multimodality', 'neurobiological mechanism', 'neuroimaging', 'neuroinflammation', 'obesity development', 'obesity risk', 'obesity treatment', 'professional atmosphere', 'psychosocial', 'public health relevance', 'racial difference', 'social']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K23,2020,202864,0.041346660786845284
