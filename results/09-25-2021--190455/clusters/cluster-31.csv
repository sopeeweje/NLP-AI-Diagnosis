"Development of a Machine Learning Model for Prostate Cancer Treatment Planning This project’s goal is to develop and test an application that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve consistency and quality of RT treatment plans for prostate cancer. By understanding expert planner preferences in structure contouring and treatment planning, and combining this rationale with data amassed in NRG clinical trials, AI models will be trained to produce contours and treatment plans achieving consensus amongst experts and optimal quality of life outcomes based on more clinical evidence than any one expert’s input. Overall, this project will meet a need for improved treatment planning for prostate cancer at reduced economic cost.  This AI system will generate treatment plans that will provide a standard which may be compared against those generated by human planners; in time, as teams at individual institutions who employ the product develop greater experience with the system, their engagement will foster the achievement of plans at higher quality with lower investment of human capital, thereby improving quality of care while reducing costs. n/a",Development of a Machine Learning Model for Prostate Cancer Treatment Planning,10027488,5N91019C00054,"['Achievement', 'Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Computer software', 'Consensus', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Development', 'Dose', 'Expert Systems', 'Fostering', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Outcome', 'Patient imaging', 'Patients', 'Process', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Quality of Care', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation therapy', 'Structure', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cost', 'economic cost', 'experience', 'human capital', 'improved', 'meetings', 'preference', 'prostate cancer model', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NCI,"NICOLALDE R AND D, LLC",N43,2019,300000,0.11329467416881477
"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9745302,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'random forest', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2019,1,0.10924608608343134
"Content-based MR-TRUS Fusion without Tracking There are about 3 million American men living with prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States. If the prostate cancer is caught early before it spreads to other parts of the body, by active monitoring or treatment, most men will not die from it. Nevertheless, 22% to 47% of the patients with negative biopsies but elevated prostate-specific antigen levels may still harbor malignant tumors, which can be life threatening and could have been missed by the commonly used ultrasound guided random biopsy. By contrast, fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted biopsies has shown to significantly improve the cancer detection rate. However, MR-TRUS fusion itself is very challenging due to the difficulties in directly registering images of these two very different modalities in different dimensions. To bypass the difficult registration problems, the existing fusion techniques require the use of specialized expensive and cumbersome hardware tracking devices, which increases cost and elongates procedures. More importantly, due to a number of factors such as patient movement, respiratory motion and ultrasound transducer pressure change, prostate motion can happen during a procedure and cause the images to be misaligned. Timely noticing and correcting such motion require great skill and knowledge of radiological imaging, where studies show a steep learning curve for mastering fusion systems. Failing in image registration and motion compensation renders the fusion guided biopsy performing no differently than random biopsy. To address the fundamental cause of the problems, the goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR- TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices. The proposed research is foundational for developing next generation of MR-TRUS fusion guidance systems for prostate biopsy to achieve robust performance with lower costs. Recent advancement in machine learning, especially deep learning, has provided us new tools and new angles to tackle this challenging problem. This project aims for directly fusing 2D TRUS frames with 3D MR volume by developing novel deep learning methods for image reconstruction and registration. The proposed methods are designed to exploit both population and patient specific imaging information to accurately align images. As all learning-based image registration methods try to better use population knowledge to improve the registration performance, few of them have been able to efficiently use patient specific information, which can be essential to obtain robust and accurate performance. Upon successful completion, the innovation created from the project will disrupt the common perception that hardware tracking has to be used for multimodal image fusion-guided interventions and alleviate the demand on physicians’ experience and skill in image analysis and fusion to help obtain consistent results. This project will lead to the development of novel prostate biopsy systems and will also impact a range of other image fusion based interventional guidance technologies. Fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted prostate biopsies can significantly improve the detection of aggressive cancer. The goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR-TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices.

"DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND AND DUPLICATE EXPERTS RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING FOR PROSTATE CANCER Use of the Oncospace framework for AI-based prostate radiotherapy treatment planning  The goal of this program is to establish a fully automated treatment planning method for low, intermediate, and high-risk prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. The program will use artificial intelligence (AI) methods trained with our existing database of over 1600 prostate treatment plans including clinical outcomes. Results inherently reflect the expert judgement of the original planners regarding dosimetric tradeoffs. The methods will include integrity checking of normal anatomy and target volume structures to identify potential manual or automatic contouring errors. The system will be used to automate treatment plan generation from the point when structures have been drawn until the plan requires expert assessment/approval. Plans for patients in each risk category will be validated against those generated and approved by three expert radiation oncologists, where assessment criteria is decided upon a priori by consensus between experts. Benefits include time savings via use of knowledge-driven versus trial and error-based plan objectives, more personalized treatment plans and improved quality control. n/a",DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI) TOOLS TO UNDERSTAND AND DUPLICATE EXPERTS RADIATION THERAPY PLANNING FOR PROSTATE CANCER,10027481,5N91019C00044,"['Anatomy', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Cancer Patient', 'Categories', 'Clinical', 'Consensus', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Dose', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Knowledge', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Quality Control', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation Oncologist', 'Radiation therapy', 'Risk', 'Savings', 'Structure', 'Structure of base of prostate', 'System', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'base', 'high risk', 'improved', 'knowledge base', 'personalized medicine', 'programs', 'prostate cancer risk', 'tool', 'treatment planning']",NCI,"ONCOSPACE, INC.",N01,2019,299433,0.12673879336497706
"Predicting the Presence of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer using Multiparametric MRI and MR-US Fusion Biopsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, accounting for 26% of new cancer diagnoses and 9% of cancer deaths in men. Active surveillance, radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy are commonly used treatments for clinically localized prostate cancer. However, current risk stratification methods cannot be used effectively to avoid subjecting patients with clinically indolent cancers to unnecessary interventions, causing significant morbidity and cost. The primary components currently involved in screening are the digital rectal exam (DRE) and serum biomarkers, such as PSA, PCA3, PHI, and 4Kscore. Unfortunately, despite advances in these tests, overdiagnosis remains a major problem due to limited specificity. As a result, 90% of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer receive treatment, even though up to 60% of those patients could be candidates for active surveillance. Such treatment often results in long-term reductions in functional outcomes. The research objective of this R21 is to develop novel techniques using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) and MRI-ultrasound (US) fusion guided biopsy data that provide discriminatory power in distinguishing indolent versus clinically significant prostatic adenocarcinoma based on non-invasive imaging. We propose to implement a multi-instance learning (MIL) based convolutional neural network (CNN) model for clinical prostate mp-MRI sequences to generate new quantitative imaging features representative of the underlying tissue. Our MIL-CNN model will accommodate ground truth labels from pathology whole mount specimens, as well as MRI-US fusion biopsy results. Hierarchical CNN features will be used to predict voxel- level cancer suspicion, thereby enabling a novel method for performing “imaging biopsy.” Finally, voxel-level suspicion maps will be aggregated into patient-level quantitative imaging biomarkers and combined with clinical data to create a multimodal nomogram for performing risk stratification. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, accounting for 26% of new cancer diagnoses and 9% of cancer deaths in men. The focus of this research is to investigate new methods for distinguishing indolent from aggressive prostate cancer through the use of medical imaging and data min- ing, thus preventing patients from receiving unnecessary treatment and incurring associated negative function- al outcomes.",Predicting the Presence of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer using Multiparametric MRI and MR-US Fusion Biopsy,9699449,R21CA220352,"['Accounting', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Localized Malignant Neoplasm', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nomograms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Adenocarcinoma', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Public Health', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Savings', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transrectal Ultrasound', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prostate cancer risk', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'rectal', 'screening', 'screening guidelines', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2019,156788,0.2021623346675846
"Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown that delivery of higher radiation doses to the prostate results in improved tumor control rates in prostate cancer radiation therapy (RT). As local recurrence mostly occurs at the primary tumor, particularly for high-risk patients, additional dose escalation is expected to improve the treatment outcome. However, the application of dose escalation for prostate RT is greatly limited by the tolerance of nearby healthy tissues that cannot adequately be excluded from the radiation field. This limitation can be overcome by dose painting, where a higher dose is applied to the prostate tumor only instead of the whole prostate gland. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) offers reduced treatment time, convenience, and possibly increased treatment efficacy as compared to the conventionally fraction scheme. UTSW is currently conducting a dose escalation trial using SBRT for high-risk prostate cancer patients with an integrated dose boost on MRI-visualized prostate tumor. However, prostate can move and deform during the beam delivery. To ensure the escalated dose is actually delivered to tumor regions as planned, a reliable tumor tracking method is urgently needed. While intra-prostatic tumors can be identified by multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) for treatment planning, intrafraction tumor tracking during the beam delivery is not achievable with mpMRI. In contrast, ultrasound offers a cost-effective and real-time imaging with high soft tissue contrast. However, conventional ultrasound techniques only provide anatomic structure of the prostate gland without the capability to differentiate tumor region from the rest of the prostate gland. Temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) has emerged as a new paradigm for prostate tissue characterization by analyzing the time-series ultrasound images with advanced machine learning techniques. In this project, we aim to develop, optimize and evaluate an innovative TeUS based intra-prostatic tumor tracking method to guide SBRT with an integrated dose boost for high-risk prostate cancer patients. The specific aims are: 1) Develop TeUS-based intra-prostatic tumor delineation for guiding focused dose escalation; 2) Integrate and validate TeUS-based tumor tracking system during SBRT; and 3) Evaluate clinical gain of TeUS guided SBRT for high risk prostate cancer patients. Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the development and validation of a low-cost yet highly accurate TeUS guided system for targeted prostate cancer RT. With enhanced real-time visualization of tumor, the use of TeUS for RT guidance will lead to better treatment efficacy and reduced toxicity. Delivery of higher radiation doses to the tumor region can improve outcome of radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer patients. As the prostate can move and deform during radiation beam delivery, there is an urgent need for a reliable method to ensure escalated dose is delivered to the tumor region as planned. We will develop, integrate and evaluate a novel prostate tumor tracking method based on temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) to guide radiation therapy for high-risk patients, which will lead to higher local control with improved toxicity.",Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT,9713860,R01EB027898,"['Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Imagery', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Probability', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Prostatic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapy trial', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'early phase trial', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate cancer risk', 'real-time images', 'soft tissue', 'standard care', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'vibration']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,373971,0.16301538725589795
"High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy Project Summary: In prostate cancer (PCa), the presence and amount of residual tumor at the surface of the excised prostate is the only prognostic factor that is affected by surgical technique, vs. other factors, which are fixed and non-modifiable. Yet, positive surgical margins (PSM), defined as the presence of tumor cells at the inked surface of the removed specimen, are common, especially in advanced stage cancers, and are a strong independent risk factor for clinical progression and secondary treatment. In addition, elevated post-operative PSA, which is understood to be related to tumor left behind in the patient, is also associated with high risk of progression and secondary treatment. Thus, complete tumor removal is important to achieve to improve  patient outcomes and reduce overtreatment, yet there is a delicate balance between resection radicality and  minimizing damage to the neurovascular bundles to preserve post-operative function. The NeuroSAFE trial demonstrated that real-time detection and correction of PSMs by comprehensive histology of the prostate  circumference results in improved patient outcomes, yet there are no widely adoptable methods to achieve this. In an effort to address this technical gap, we have developed video-rate structured illumination microscopy (VR-SIM) and demonstrated that it enables accurate diagnosis of PCa in the biopsy setting, and that it can  rapidly deliver gigapixel microscopic images of the entire prostate surface for detection of PSMs. VR-SIM delivers the surface area coverage and resolution needed to detect PSMs, yet it is also fast and relatively simple and inexpensive, opening the possibility for widespread adoption. In this project, our interdisciplinary team of  engineers and clinicians with significant prostate expertise will further advance this technology towards clinical translation, by completing critical technology development steps and by prospectively validating it in a large patient series. Specifically, we will increase the mechanical automation speed of the device, and will develop a fully automated system for handling of the removed prostate, to enable gigapixel panoramas of the entire  prostate circumferential surface to be delivered within 10 minutes of removal and with minimal tissue processing and user intervention. We will then leverage our recently developed dual-color fluorescent stain that replicates standard H&E with high specificity, to develop expert-validated clinical image atlases using biopsies and  cadaveric specimens to enhance image interpretation of VR-SIM prostate panoramas. These improvements will be combined to test the system in a prospective 250-patient clinical study, to determine the accuracy of the device for intra-operative detection of PSMs and prediction of post-operative PSA based on measurement of PSM extent. Finally, we will measure and model expert reviewer behavior using a novel web-enabled visual observer tracking method, which could be used in future computer-assisted search algorithms to expedite  intra-operative image review. Successful completion will set the stage for multi-center clinical trials to validate the clinical utility of VR-SIM for real-time detection and correction of PSMs, and improvement of patient outcomes. Project Narrative: Achieving complete tumor removal in prostate cancer is an important goal to achieve because leaving tumor behind in the patient contributes to increased risk of cancer progression and need for additional harmful treatment. Yet, it is difficult to determine in real-time if surgery is successful due to the lack of available technologies for intra-operative guidance. This project will develop a rapid scanner that will automatically scan the entire prostate surface for residual tumor within 10 minutes of removal, providing images which are readily interpreted by trained pathologists and enabling real-time guidance of nerve-sparing prostate cancer surgery.",High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy,9731447,R01CA222831,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Case Series', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Computer Assisted', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Frozen Sections', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Ink', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nerve', 'Online Systems', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Prostate', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surface of the Prostate', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analog', 'authority', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'cancer surgery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computer aided detection', 'contrast imaging', 'high risk', 'histological image', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'microscopic imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neurovascular', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate surgery', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'technology development', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'visual search', 'web-enabled']",NCI,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2019,384646,0.1944543663361857
"Prostate Cancer Imaging Prostate cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in males. As a result of screening with serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) there has been a dramatic increase in the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer, about 220,000 new diagnoses annually. The diagnosis is being made at a younger age yet the morbidity of the standard treatment such as surgery and radiation---remain unchanged. Thus, men with the diagnosis of prostate cancer are likely being overtreated for their disease and will live with the consequences of this treatment for many years, greatly affecting the Quality of Life Years (QALY). The ultimate answer to this dilemma is serum biomarkers that identify lethal cancers but not incidental cancers but this is unlikely to occur soon. Indeed, recent studies show that the PSA screening test does not lead to improved outcomes. In the meantime, methods of localizing prostate cancer and treating them with minimally invasive therapy would dramatically lessen the morbidity associated with widespread screening and the overdiagnosis of prostate cancer. A variety of imaging methods have been developed and we are exploring their role in localizing early prostate cancer. The MIP has partnered with the Urologic Oncology Branch to develop new imaging methods to be coupled with minimally invasive treatment methods which include RF ablation, cryotherapy and alcohol ablation. The MIP is engaged in a number of pre-clinical studies in prostate cancer. We have been investigating a variety of targeted imaging agents. Initially, we have evaluated several antibodies and antibody fragments against PSMA (3TC, J591) in animal models of prostate cancer. Recently we began using PSMA PET based on small molecules that target PSMA. Metabolic studies of prostate cancer may have implications for therapy. We are investigating PET in animal models of prostate cancer to detect differences in metabolism between the androgen-sensitive and insensitive state. Moreover, we are launching a program in C13 hyperpolarization of pyruvate which will enable non invasive monitoring of metabolism Clinical Trials The MIP has been studying prostate cancer imaging in humans since its inception. We perform endorectal coil MRI at 3T . We have developed analytic tools for all in conjunction with a CRADA with the Philips Medical Systems. We have demonstrated that a multiparametric approach improves the specificity of 3T MRI for prostate cancer. However, there remain significant limitations in the sensitivity and specificity of 3T MRI. After patients undergo prostatectomy and their specimens are available for review it is clear that less than 40% would be amenable for focal therapy based on being single, well circumscribed lesions that are visible on MRI. We have designed a customized prostate mold which is in use in all patients at NCI. It enables the imaging to be directly correlated with the pathologic specimen. Therefore, working with Philips Medical Systems we have designed an US-MR fusion system that takes the data from the 3T MRI and fuses it to the real time ultrasound image. This product was released for sale in 2013 under the name UroNav. Biopsy and interventional procedures can then be performed under MR guidance using the ultrasound. This device has been used successfully in 1500 patients at NCI. A dog study showed the accuracy was about 3-4mm. We are currently using a similar platform to direct focal laser ablation (FLA) of suitable prostate lesions (i.e. ones that are well demarcated, low Gleason score and could otherwise be watched. We are also testing HIFU in animal models. Computer aided diagnosis and machine learning are new areas of research. We are searching for PET agents that might be more specific for prostate cancer, especially in detecting metastases. For instance, we completed a PET study using 11C-Acetate to study the value of this agent in identifying intraprostatic lesions. Patients also underwent 3T MRI and the PET image which were fused to the MRI. We have completed a trial using the tracer 18F-ACBC, an agent associated with amino acid transport which has shown success in localizing recurrent prostate cancer. Ultimately we wish to combine PET-MR studies and conduct minimally invasive therapies after US fusion. We have also been approved to test the agent, F18-DCFBC which is a low molecular weight tracer directed at PSMA. We are performing PET studies with a PSMA targeted PET agent.

"Imaging of prostate cancer by combined quantitative ultrasound and acoustic-radiation-force-impulse imaging Project Summary/Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most-common cancer of men in the United States. The goal of the project is to develop a reliable, imaging tool for characterizing prostate tissue. This tool will improve detection, grading, treatment, and monitoring of PCa. It can be implemented in existing clinical scanners for effective needle-biopsy guidance and for planning and targeting focal therapy. Such a tool would significantly reduce the amount of unnecessary biopsies of noncancerous tissue and the current high rate of false negative diagnoses. It also would allow monitoring diagnosed PCa during watchful waiting or after non-surgical therapies. We propose to investigate the feasibility of fusing acoustic radiation-force impulse (ARFI) imaging and quantitative ultrasound (QUS) for typing prostate tissue. Studies to date have demonstrated encouraging performance of each ultrasonic modality when used alone. However, the ability of the combined modalities has not yet been investigated. The proposed project seeks to extract features from a retrospective data set containing radio-frequency (RF) ultrasound data acquired while performing in vivo prostate ARFI imaging. Images generated from both technologies are intrinsically perfectly registered. We will employ our well-established QUS-processing procedures to extract QUS-parameter maps from the RF-data and will develop and test new algorithms to extend the feature set from our established QUS-processing to incorporate ARFI image features. We will use standard and new features from QUS and ARFI for training linear and non-linear classifiers (e.g. support vector machines) to identify and image PCa. We will compare the performance of classifiers trained with QUS alone, ARFI alone, and MRI alone. Furthermore, we will assess performance improvement if classifiers are trained based on QUS- ARFI, QUS-MRI, ARFI-MRI, and QUS-ARFI-MRI parameter combinations and will determine the best classifier to detect prostate cancerous tissue using cross-validation and receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) statistics. If this project is successful, subsequent projects will focus on integrating the newly developed tools into clinical scanners. Project Narrative We propose to assess the feasibility of a novel tool for imaging and detection of prostate cancer (PCa) that combines quantitative ultrasound and acoustic radiation-force imaging. If our proposed method proves to be feasible and ultimately is successful, it will have a major impact on clinical practice by reducing the current high rates of false-negative diagnoses of PCa and by enabling non-invasive, low-risk, low-cost monitoring of PCa.",Imaging of prostate cancer by combined quantitative ultrasound and acoustic-radiation-force-impulse imaging,9737939,R03EB026233,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlas of Cancer Mortality in the United States', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Consumption', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Intercept', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relaxation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer classification', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'male', 'men', 'novel', 'patient population', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'radio frequency', 'routine imaging', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,RIVERSIDE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2019,78801,0.18233345841793092
"Urinary biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis and risk assessment PROJECT ABSTRACT This project aims to develop a urine-based screening tool for prostate cancer that could affect at least 13 million men in the US who receive prostate cancer screening every year. Today, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) remains the most commonly used screening test for prostate cancer (PCa), but the lack of specificity of PSA has led to unnecessary prostate biopsies. In addition, PCa is a heterogeneous disease ranging from indolent to life threatening or clinically significant. About 20% to 50% of men who get a positive biopsy have PCa that never grows, spreads, or harms them. Thus, there is a great need to develop better alternatives that can reliably diagnose PCa and also identify men with clinically significant prostate cancer who are most likely to benefit from early diagnosis while avoiding the over-diagnosis and overtreatment of indolent cancer. Research has found that trained dogs can distinguish patients with and without PCa by sniffing their urine. In turn, we can use these odor-producing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as biomarkers for PCa diagnosis and risk assessment. Our preliminary data have shown that VOCs in urine are significantly different (p<0.05) between prostate cancer patients and healthy subjects. We hypothesize that pathological processes of PCa can alter the production of specific VOCs that are different and distinguishable from the VOC profile of healthy individuals. We also hypothesize that certain PCa specific VOCs are conserved across different ethnic groups, and that these VOCs are highly significant for diagnosing PCa. In this proposed study, we aim to (1) develop a urinary VOC-based screening model for PCa diagnosis; (2) create a prostate cancer risk model based on urinary VOCs for differentiating indolent from clinically significant PCa, and (3) evaluate longitudinal patterns of change of urinary VOC profiles in men with and without prostate disease. The expected outcomes and impacts of the project is to develop a non-invasive urinary VOC based model that can detect PCa with over 90 % accuracy, thus providing a better alternative to the current PSA test for PCa diagnosis. Furthermore, the VOC risk model could become a revolutionary tool with high specificity for clinically significant PCa; it has the benefit of early diagnosis while preventing over-diagnosis (i.e. finding indolent PCa that will never develop into advanced deleterious PCa) and overtreatment of indolent PCa (i.e. getting unnecessary and aggressive treatment). It would directly benefit over 13 million men receiving PSA testing in the US annually, and prevent at least 2 million unnecessary biopsies and their inherent risks (pain, bleeding, infection, death), and will reduce cost (time away from work, cost of procedure and ancillary studies) and anxiety. PROJECT NARRATIVES This research is to use the organic metabolites in urine as biomarkers to diagnose prostate cancer (PCa). We expect to develop a non-invasive urinary VOC based screening model that can detect PCa with over 90 % accuracy, thus providing a better alternative to the current PSA test for PCa diagnosis.

"Statistical Genetics and Genomics for Epidemiologic Research Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have identified an unprecedented number of genetic variants associated with disease risk, yet molecular mechanisms and clinical implications of genetic risk alleles are largely unknown. Epidemiologic research is extending its reach to more translational and mechanistic studies, integrating genetic risk variants with environmental exposures, interventions, gene expression and epigenetics. Motivated by population-based studies for prostate cancer research, we will develop statistical methods for emerging translational topics: how to search for genotypes that predict individual and subgroup intervention effects? how to identify epigenetic alterations that may be an interface of the environment and the genome? how to assess causal mediation effect of a modifiable risk factor or a molecular alteration in relation to disease outcomes? These topics present unmet statistical challenges because of high dimensionality and complex modeling. Specific statistical methods to be developed include high-dimensional gene- treatment interaction, multi-locus regional association, mediation analyses, instrumental variable analyses, Mendelian randomization, and shrinkage and regularization.  The methodological research in this project is driven primarily by prostate cancer, the most common noncutaneous cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, a ecting one in six in his lifetime. This project nests in highly-accomplished consortium studies (PCPT/SELECT/PRACTICAL/PCPS), all of which have generated far-reaching impact on prostate cancer research. The unique feature of this project is that methodological development will be seamlessly integrated with ongoing analyses, ensuring immediate translation. Our transdisciplinary research team has been actively engaged in statistical genetics and genomics, and conducting molecular epidemiological studies. The PI brings a wealth of expertise in high-dimensional methods, molecular biomarkers, and genetic epidemiology. This project will have a far-reaching impact on methodologies in cancer etiology, prevention, and treatment outcomes. Project Narrative In this project we will develop a suite of statistical methodologies for dissecting the multi-faceted role of genetics and genomics in modern epidemiology, and perform innovative analyses in well-characterized extant populations for prostate cancer research.

"MRI Imaging and Biomarkers for Early Detection of Aggressive Prostate Cancer Abstract  Oversampling and overdiagnosis of prostate cancer are significant management and cost issues that burden our health care system and the individual at risk with unnecessary biopsies and potential complications. The proposed studies will validate recent advances in quantitative prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) techniques, blood biomarkers of aggressive prostate cancer and radiogenomics that relate to increased aggressive cancer risk by our group and collaborators. The overarching goal is to increase the negative predictive value (NPV) for significant prostate cancer and consequently reduce unnecessary biopsies. Central to the proposal are key collaborations between investigators from the Consortium for Imaging and Biomarkers (CIB), Early Detection Research Network (EDRN), and Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPL).  Novel automated techniques for quantitative analysis of mpMRI that identify prostate habitats at risk of harboring significant prostate cancer (Gleason score 3+4 and above or Grade Group (GG)2+) will be combined with improvements in mpMRI-ultrasound fusion biopsies. Our automated pixel-by-pixel 3D prostate habitat risk scoring (HRS) system is superior to the standard prostate lesion classification system, PIRADSv2, and is hypothesized to improve the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for significant GG2+ cancers (Aim 1). Radiomics will be applied in Aim 1 to refine HRS in the University of Miami MDSelect protocol of 250 men (discovery=150; validation=100).  Just as PIRADSv2 is suboptimal because it does not incorporate quantitative imaging information in risk stratification, models of risk based only on histopathologic grading ignore the underlying genomic determinants of outcome. We have shown that radiomics features are associated with underlying gene expression markers of adverse outcome. We propose in Aim 2 to apply newer criteria that incorporate Decipher® score with clinical-pathologic factors to improve the identification of aggressive prostate cancer. Radiomic features associated with these published criteria, termed the Spratt criteria, will improve the NPV for nonaggressive prostate cancer in the MDSelect cohort.  We will also collaborate with investigators involved in the EDRN ID-430 clinical trial to test our models in a cohort (n=200) in a less rigorously controlled multi-institutional group with more variability in imaging techniques, vendors and machines.  There is also opportunity to further improve risk classification through the analysis of blood-based markers (Aim 3) such as 4Kscore, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating cancer associated macrophage like (CAML) cells that are early biomarkers of aggressive cancer. The proposed work will test the incremental benefit of adding these serum-based biomarkers to improve the NPV models for significant prostate cancer. Narrative  Oversampling and over-diagnosis of prostate cancer are significant management and cost issues that burden our health care system and the individual at risk with unnecessary biopsies and potential complications. The proposed work will combine quantitative imaging features, informed by tumor grade and gene expression, with blood based biomarkers into an objective, automated, tool optimized to achieve a high negative predictive value for significant cancer in undiagnosed men referred for prostate biopsy. Two cohorts, one from the University of Miami (“MDSelect”) and the other from the EDRN will be used to validate/extend that the developed mpMRI based habitat risk scoring system is superior to the more standard PIRADSv2 in identifying significant cancers in the prostate.",MRI Imaging and Biomarkers for Early Detection of Aggressive Prostate Cancer,9837273,U01CA239141,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Gland', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Information Systems', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostatectomy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiogenomics', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Volume', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'genomic signature', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'macrophage', 'men', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prostate biopsy', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'reconstruction', 'rectal', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'urinary']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2019,629523,0.24920932671605983
"Development of a Multimodal Deep Learning Model for the Generation of Cancer Probability Maps and Imaging Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer using Multiparametric MRI Project Summary/Abstract Background: Prostatic adenocarcinoma is the most common newly diagnosed cancer and second deadliest cancer in American men. There is a large discrepancy between the incidence of the disease and its mortality rate. Thus, the development of screening tools to identify prostate cancer and determine if it is aggressive or indolent is an area of considerable interest. Current methods rely on the use of serum biomarkers and follow-up biopsies for screening. However, there is substantial debate as to the appropriate methodology for screening. The goal of this proposal is the development of: 1) new imaging biomarkers (i.e., “features”) for prostate cancer; and 2) a novel predictive model for the presence of aggressive prostatic adenocarcinoma. These tools will enable more effective use of mp-MRI in prostate cancer screening in the future and thus enable a future improvement in the sensitivity and specificity of screening, reducing the rates of overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis. Aim 1: To implement a deep learning algorithm for clinical prostate mp-MRI sequences, creating a cancer prob- ability map that is predictive of biopsy results. Aim 2: To create a multimodal framework that will combine discovered imaging features with clinical data points from the medical record (e.g., age, risk factors, medical history, biomarkers) to predict the presence and aggressiveness of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Methods: In Aim 1, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) will be trained on a clinical dataset comprised of patches extracted from pre-prostatectomy mp-MRI sequences from patients with prostate cancer, using his- topathology analysis of whole-mount radical prostatectomy specimens as ground truth. The innovations in this aim will be the development of a CNN that can simultaneously learn from three different imaging sequence types, the use of patches for data augmentation, and the proper alignment of mp-MRI sequences and prostatectomy specimens for machine learning. The result of the work of this aim will be the creation of an algorithm for gen- erating imaging biomarkers (features) and cancer probability maps from mp-MRI data. In Aim 2, a multimodal learning framework that will integrate mp-MRI sequence data with clinical parameters in order to predict the presence of aggressive prostatic adenocarcinoma will be developed. The innovation in this aim will be the devel- opment of a framework that can integrate information from multiple modalities (imaging, serum, history, etc.) in order to generate a high confidence prediction of the presence of aggressive prostate cancer without the use of invasive testing.

"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9527787,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2018,347700,0.10924608608343134
"Predicting the Presence of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer using Multiparametric MRI and MR-US Fusion Biopsy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, accounting for 26% of new cancer diagnoses and 9% of cancer deaths in men. Active surveillance, radical prostatectomy and radiotherapy are commonly used treatments for clinically localized prostate cancer. However, current risk stratification methods cannot be used effectively to avoid subjecting patients with clinically indolent cancers to unnecessary interventions, causing significant morbidity and cost. The primary components currently involved in screening are the digital rectal exam (DRE) and serum biomarkers, such as PSA, PCA3, PHI, and 4Kscore. Unfortunately, despite advances in these tests, overdiagnosis remains a major problem due to limited specificity. As a result, 90% of patients diagnosed with prostate cancer receive treatment, even though up to 60% of those patients could be candidates for active surveillance. Such treatment often results in long-term reductions in functional outcomes. The research objective of this R21 is to develop novel techniques using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mp-MRI) and MRI-ultrasound (US) fusion guided biopsy data that provide discriminatory power in distinguishing indolent versus clinically significant prostatic adenocarcinoma based on non-invasive imaging. We propose to implement a multi-instance learning (MIL) based convolutional neural network (CNN) model for clinical prostate mp-MRI sequences to generate new quantitative imaging features representative of the underlying tissue. Our MIL-CNN model will accommodate ground truth labels from pathology whole mount specimens, as well as MRI-US fusion biopsy results. Hierarchical CNN features will be used to predict voxel- level cancer suspicion, thereby enabling a novel method for performing “imaging biopsy.” Finally, voxel-level suspicion maps will be aggregated into patient-level quantitative imaging biomarkers and combined with clinical data to create a multimodal nomogram for performing risk stratification. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, accounting for 26% of new cancer diagnoses and 9% of cancer deaths in men. The focus of this research is to investigate new methods for distinguishing indolent from aggressive prostate cancer through the use of medical imaging and data min- ing, thus preventing patients from receiving unnecessary treatment and incurring associated negative function- al outcomes.",Predicting the Presence of Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer using Multiparametric MRI and MR-US Fusion Biopsy,9604227,R21CA220352,"['Accounting', 'American', 'Architecture', 'Biological Markers', 'Biological Neural Networks', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Procedure', 'Disease', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Evaluation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Guidelines', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Institution', 'Intervention', 'Label', 'Learning', 'Localized Malignant Neoplasm', 'Location', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'National Comprehensive Cancer Network', 'Neural Network Simulation', 'Nomograms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathology', 'Patient risk', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Population', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Adenocarcinoma', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Public Health', 'Radiation therapy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk stratification', 'Savings', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Signal Transduction', 'Slide', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Transrectal Ultrasound', 'Ultrasonography', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer therapy', 'clinical predictors', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'data mining', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'digital pathology', 'follow-up', 'functional outcomes', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'non-invasive imaging', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'predictive modeling', 'prevent', 'prostate cancer risk', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiologist', 'rectal', 'screening', 'tool', 'treatment planning', 'unnecessary treatment']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2018,195568,0.2021623346675846
"Prostate Cancer Imaging Prostate cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in males. As a result of screening with serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) there has been a dramatic increase in the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer, about 220,000 new diagnoses annually. The diagnosis is being made at a younger age yet the morbidity of the standard treatment such as surgery and radiation---remain unchanged. Thus, men with the diagnosis of prostate cancer are likely being overtreated for their disease and will live with the consequences of this treatment for many years, greatly affecting the Quality of Life Years (QALY). The ultimate answer to this dilemma is serum biomarkers that identify lethal cancers but not incidental cancers but this is unlikely to occur soon. Indeed, recent studies show that the PSA screening test does not lead to improved outcomes. In the meantime, methods of localizing prostate cancer and treating them with minimally invasive therapy would dramatically lessen the morbidity associated with widespread screening and the overdiagnosis of prostate cancer. A variety of imaging methods have been developed and we are exploring their role in localizing early prostate cancer. The MIP has partnered with the Urologic Oncology Branch to develop new imaging methods to be coupled with minimally invasive treatment methods which include RF ablation, cryotherapy and alcohol ablation. The MIP is engaged in a number of pre-clinical studies in prostate cancer. We have been investigating a variety of targeted imaging agents. Initially, we have evaluated several antibodies and antibody fragments against PSMA (3TC, J591) in animal models of prostate cancer. Recently we began using PSMA PET based on small molecules that target PSMA. Metabolic studies of prostate cancer may have implications for therapy. We are investigating PET in animal models of prostate cancer to detect differences in metabolism between the androgen-sensitive and insensitive state. Moreover, we are launching a program in C13 hyperpolarization of pyruvate which will enable non invasive monitoring of metabolism Clinical Trials The MIP has been studying prostate cancer imaging in humans since its inception. We perform endorectal coil MRI at 3T . We have developed analytic tools for all in conjunction with a CRADA with the Philips Medical Systems. We have demonstrated that a multiparametric approach improves the specificity of 3T MRI for prostate cancer. However, there remain significant limitations in the sensitivity and specificity of 3T MRI. After patients undergo prostatectomy and their specimens are available for review it is clear that less than 40% would be amenable for focal therapy based on being single, well circumscribed lesions that are visible on MRI. We have designed a customized prostate mold which is in use in all patients at NCI. It enables the imaging to be directly correlated with the pathologic specimen. Therefore, working with Philips Medical Systems we have designed an US-MR fusion system that takes the data from the 3T MRI and fuses it to the real time ultrasound image. This product was released for sale in 2013 under the name UroNav. Biopsy and interventional procedures can then be performed under MR guidance using the ultrasound. This device has been used successfully in 1500 patients at NCI. A dog study showed the accuracy was about 3-4mm. We are currently using a similar platform to direct focal laser ablation (FLA) of suitable prostate lesions (i.e. ones that are well demarcated, low Gleason score and could otherwise be watched. We are also testing HIFU in animal models. Computer aided diagnosis and machine learning are new areas of research. We are searching for PET agents that might be more specific for prostate cancer, especially in detecting metastases. For instance, we completed a PET study using 11C-Acetate to study the value of this agent in identifying intraprostatic lesions. Patients also underwent 3T MRI and the PET image which were fused to the MRI. We have completed a trial using the tracer 18F-ACBC, an agent associated with amino acid transport which has shown success in localizing recurrent prostate cancer. Ultimately we wish to combine PET-MR studies and conduct minimally invasive therapies after US fusion. We have also been approved to test the agent, F18-DCFBC which is a low molecular weight tracer directed at PSMA. We are performing PET studies with a PSMA targeted PET agent. We are conducting trials using F18 DCFPyl, a second generation agent directed at PSMA. This agent has already shown great potential to characterize the disease status even when post treatment PSA levels are quite low. We are also generating computer aided diagnosis (CAD) devices and algorithms that could automate the diagnosis of prostate cancer. n/a",Prostate Cancer Imaging,9779675,ZIABC010655,"['Ablation', 'Acetates', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Alcohols', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amino Acids', 'Animal Model', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cessation of life', 'Circumscribed Lesion', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cold Therapy', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Cooperative Research and Development Agreement', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Focused Ultrasound Therapy', 'Generations', 'Genomics', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments', 'Intervention', 'J591 Monoclonal Antibody', 'Lamivudine', 'Lasers', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Methods', 'Molds', 'Molecular Weight', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural History', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatectomy', 'Pyruvate', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Radiation', 'Radiofrequency Interstitial Ablation', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Skin Cancer', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urologic Oncology', 'analytical tool', 'androgen sensitive', 'base', 'blind', 'bone imaging', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer recurrence', 'computer generated', 'design', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'male', 'men', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'minimally invasive', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'preclinical study', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate cancer model', 'screening', 'small molecule', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'success', 'targeted agent', 'targeted imaging', 'tumor']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2018,3460723,0.26952000691711075
"Imaging of prostate cancer by combined quantitative ultrasound and acoustic-radiation-force-impulse imaging Project Summary/Abstract Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most-common cancer of men in the United States. The goal of the project is to develop a reliable, imaging tool for characterizing prostate tissue. This tool will improve detection, grading, treatment, and monitoring of PCa. It can be implemented in existing clinical scanners for effective needle-biopsy guidance and for planning and targeting focal therapy. Such a tool would significantly reduce the amount of unnecessary biopsies of noncancerous tissue and the current high rate of false negative diagnoses. It also would allow monitoring diagnosed PCa during watchful waiting or after non-surgical therapies. We propose to investigate the feasibility of fusing acoustic radiation-force impulse (ARFI) imaging and quantitative ultrasound (QUS) for typing prostate tissue. Studies to date have demonstrated encouraging performance of each ultrasonic modality when used alone. However, the ability of the combined modalities has not yet been investigated. The proposed project seeks to extract features from a retrospective data set containing radio-frequency (RF) ultrasound data acquired while performing in vivo prostate ARFI imaging. Images generated from both technologies are intrinsically perfectly registered. We will employ our well-established QUS-processing procedures to extract QUS-parameter maps from the RF-data and will develop and test new algorithms to extend the feature set from our established QUS-processing to incorporate ARFI image features. We will use standard and new features from QUS and ARFI for training linear and non-linear classifiers (e.g. support vector machines) to identify and image PCa. We will compare the performance of classifiers trained with QUS alone, ARFI alone, and MRI alone. Furthermore, we will assess performance improvement if classifiers are trained based on QUS- ARFI, QUS-MRI, ARFI-MRI, and QUS-ARFI-MRI parameter combinations and will determine the best classifier to detect prostate cancerous tissue using cross-validation and receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) statistics. If this project is successful, subsequent projects will focus on integrating the newly developed tools into clinical scanners. Project Narrative We propose to assess the feasibility of a novel tool for imaging and detection of prostate cancer (PCa) that combines quantitative ultrasound and acoustic radiation-force imaging. If our proposed method proves to be feasible and ultimately is successful, it will have a major impact on clinical practice by reducing the current high rates of false-negative diagnoses of PCa and by enabling non-invasive, low-risk, low-cost monitoring of PCa.",Imaging of prostate cancer by combined quantitative ultrasound and acoustic-radiation-force-impulse imaging,9510757,R03EB026233,"['Acoustics', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Area', 'Atlas of Cancer Mortality in the United States', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Foundations', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Intercept', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Needle biopsy procedure', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Publishing', 'ROC Curve', 'Radiation', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Relaxation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'base', 'cancer classification', 'clinical practice', 'clinically significant', 'cost', 'cost efficient', 'image processing', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'in vivo imaging', 'male', 'men', 'novel', 'patient population', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'radio frequency', 'routine imaging', 'signal processing', 'statistics', 'tool']",NIBIB,RIVERSIDE RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R03,2018,77402,0.18233345841793092
"High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy Project Summary: In prostate cancer (PCa), the presence and amount of residual tumor at the surface of the excised prostate is the only prognostic factor that is affected by surgical technique, vs. other factors, which are fixed and non-modifiable. Yet, positive surgical margins (PSM), defined as the presence of tumor cells at the inked surface of the removed specimen, are common, especially in advanced stage cancers, and are a strong independent risk factor for clinical progression and secondary treatment. In addition, elevated post-operative PSA, which is understood to be related to tumor left behind in the patient, is also associated with high risk of progression and secondary treatment. Thus, complete tumor removal is important to achieve to improve pa- tient outcomes and reduce overtreatment, yet there is a delicate balance between resection radicality and min- imizing damage to the neurovascular bundles to preserve post-operative function. The NeuroSAFE trial demonstrated that real-time detection and correction of PSMs by comprehensive histology of the prostate cir- cumference results in improved patient outcomes, yet there are no widely adoptable methods to achieve this. In an effort to address this technical gap, we have developed video-rate structured illumination microscopy (VR-SIM) and demonstrated that it enables accurate diagnosis of PCa in the biopsy setting, and that it can rap- idly deliver gigapixel microscopic images of the entire prostate surface for detection of PSMs. VR-SIM delivers the surface area coverage and resolution needed to detect PSMs, yet it is also fast and relatively simple and inexpensive, opening the possibility for widespread adoption. In this project, our interdisciplinary team of engi- neers and clinicians with significant prostate expertise will further advance this technology towards clinical translation, by completing critical technology development steps and by prospectively validating it in a large patient series. Specifically, we will increase the mechanical automation speed of the device, and will develop a fully automated system for handling of the removed prostate, to enable gigapixel panoramas of the entire pros- tate circumferential surface to be delivered within 10 minutes of removal and with minimal tissue processing and user intervention. We will then leverage our recently developed dual-color fluorescent stain that replicates standard H&E with high specificity, to develop expert-validated clinical image atlases using biopsies and ca- daveric specimens to enhance image interpretation of VR-SIM prostate panoramas. These improvements will be combined to test the system in a prospective 250-patient clinical study, to determine the accuracy of the device for intra-operative detection of PSMs and prediction of post-operative PSA based on measurement of PSM extent. Finally, we will measure and model expert reviewer behavior using a novel web-enabled visual observer tracking method, which could be used in future computer-assisted search algorithms to expedite in- tra-operative image review. Successful completion will set the stage for multi-center clinical trials to validate the clinical utility of VR-SIM for real-time detection and correction of PSMs, and improvement of patient outcomes. Project Narrative: Achieving complete tumor removal in prostate cancer is an important goal to achieve because leaving tumor behind in the patient contributes to increased risk of cancer progression and need for additional harmful treatment. Yet, it is difficult to determine in real-time if surgery is successful due to the lack of available technologies for intra-operative guidance. This project will develop a rapid scanner that will automatically scan the entire prostate surface for residual tumor within 10 minutes of removal, providing images which are readily interpreted by trained pathologists and enabling real-time guidance of nerve-sparing prostate cancer surgery.",High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy,9604121,R01CA222831,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Case Series', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer Assisted', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Frozen Sections', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Ink', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nerve', 'Online Systems', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Outcome', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Prostate', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surface of the Prostate', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analog', 'authority', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'cancer surgery', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computer aided detection', 'contrast imaging', 'high risk', 'histological image', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'men', 'microscopic imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neurovascular', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'prospective', 'prostate surgery', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'technology development', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'visual search', 'web-enabled']",NCI,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2018,456329,0.18142863065416265
"Statistical Genetics and Genomics for Epidemiologic Research Project Summary/Abstract Genome-wide association studies have identi ed an unprecedented number of genetic variants associated with disease risk, yet molecular mechanisms and clinical implications of genetic risk alleles are largely unknown. Epidemiologic research is extending its reach to more translational and mechanistic studies, integrating genetic risk variants with environmental exposures, interventions, gene expression and epigenetics. Motivated by population-based studies for prostate cancer research, we will develop statistical methods for emerging translational topics: how to search for genotypes that predict individual and subgroup intervention e ects? how to identify epigenetic alterations that may be an interface of the environment and the genome? how to assess causal mediation e ect of a modi able risk factor or a molecular alteration in relation to disease outcomes? These topics present unmet statistical challenges because of high dimensionality and complex modeling. Speci c statistical methods to be developed include high-dimensional gene- treatment interaction, multi-locus regional association, mediation analyses, instrumental variable analyses, Mendelian randomization, and shrinkage and regularization.  The methodological research in this project is driven primarily by prostate cancer, the most common noncutaneous cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, a ecting one in six in his lifetime. This project nests in highly-accomplished consortium studies (PCPT/SELECT/PRACTICAL/PCPS), all of which have generated far-reaching impact on prostate cancer research. The unique feature of this project is that methodological development will be seamlessly integrated with ongoing analyses, ensuring immediate translation. Our transdisciplinary research team has been actively engaged in statistical genetics and genomics, and conducting molecular epidemiological studies. The PI brings a wealth of expertise in high-dimensional methods, molecular biomarkers, and genetic epidemiology.

"Development of a Multimodal Deep Learning Model for the Generation of Cancer Probability Maps and Imaging Biomarkers for Prostate Cancer using Multiparametric MRI Project Summary/Abstract Background: Prostatic adenocarcinoma is the most common newly diagnosed cancer and second deadliest cancer in American men. There is a large discrepancy between the incidence of the disease and its mortality rate. Thus, the development of screening tools to identify prostate cancer and determine if it is aggressive or indolent is an area of considerable interest. Current methods rely on the use of serum biomarkers and follow-up biopsies for screening. However, there is substantial debate as to the appropriate methodology for screening. The goal of this proposal is the development of: 1) new imaging biomarkers (i.e., “features”) for prostate cancer; and 2) a novel predictive model for the presence of aggressive prostatic adenocarcinoma. These tools will enable more effective use of mp-MRI in prostate cancer screening in the future and thus enable a future improvement in the sensitivity and specificity of screening, reducing the rates of overdiagnosis and underdiagnosis. Aim 1: To implement a deep learning algorithm for clinical prostate mp-MRI sequences, creating a cancer prob- ability map that is predictive of biopsy results. Aim 2: To create a multimodal framework that will combine discovered imaging features with clinical data points from the medical record (e.g., age, risk factors, medical history, biomarkers) to predict the presence and aggressiveness of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Methods: In Aim 1, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) will be trained on a clinical dataset comprised of patches extracted from pre-prostatectomy mp-MRI sequences from patients with prostate cancer, using his- topathology analysis of whole-mount radical prostatectomy specimens as ground truth. The innovations in this aim will be the development of a CNN that can simultaneously learn from three different imaging sequence types, the use of patches for data augmentation, and the proper alignment of mp-MRI sequences and prostatectomy specimens for machine learning. The result of the work of this aim will be the creation of an algorithm for gen- erating imaging biomarkers (features) and cancer probability maps from mp-MRI data. In Aim 2, a multimodal learning framework that will integrate mp-MRI sequence data with clinical parameters in order to predict the presence of aggressive prostatic adenocarcinoma will be developed. The innovation in this aim will be the devel- opment of a framework that can integrate information from multiple modalities (imaging, serum, history, etc.) in order to generate a high confidence prediction of the presence of aggressive prostate cancer without the use of invasive testing. Long-term Objective: The development of a novel predictive model for the presence of aggressive prostatic adenocarcinoma in prostate mp-MRI data that will enable better future use of this data for the early detection of prostate cancer. Project Narrative / Public Health Relevance Prostatic adenocarcinoma is the most common newly diagnosed cancer and second deadliest cancer in American men.

"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,9336855,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer therapy', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2017,347700,0.10924608608343134
"Gene-Gene Interactions and Their Functional Roles in Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness Project Summary/Abstract Prostate cancer with substantial clinical heterogeneity is the most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in American men. It remains unclear why some prostate tumors are more aggressive than others. Existing clinical features (such as prostate specific antigen (PSA), clinical stage and Gleason score) are not sufficient for classifying high- and low-risk prostate cancer patients. It has been shown that approximately 20% of low-risk prostate cancer patients died due to conservative treatment. Thus, there is an urgent need for identifying additional biomarkers in order to improve prediction accuracy of prostate cancer aggressiveness. The majority of current studies focus on evaluating individual genetic variants, which may not be sufficient to explain the complexity of disease causality. The objective of this study is to identify gene-gene interactions within the four candidate pathways (angiogenesis, mitochondria, miRNA, and androgen metabolism) associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness and their impact on gene expression. The genetic variants (both individual effects and interactions) associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness will be performed using the existing genetic data from the large scale prostate cancer consortium, a collection of approximately 22,000 prostate cancer patients. The associations between genetic variants and gene expressions will be identified using public domain genetic data and will be validated using a cohort data set with 1065 prostate cancer patients. Evaluating genetic variants with gene expression levels helps to identify downstream genes which can guide further study and may lead to discovery of novel therapeutic targets. Our study findings can provide valuable information toward understanding pathogenesis of prostate cancer and identifying genotype combinations for predicting prostate cancer aggressiveness. As for the long-term impact, the study results may be applied in developing effective screening tools to predict prostate cancer aggressiveness. Project Narrative For prostate cancer patients, physicians often have difficulty at the time of a prostate cancer diagnosis distinguishing between patients who will develop indolent tumors and those who will develop aggressive tumors. This study aims to identify genetic markers (genetic variants and gene expressions) involved with multiple genes associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness.

"(PQC4) Habitats in Prostate Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will address PQC-4: ""What in vivo imaging methods can be developed to portray the ""cytotype"" of a tumor defined as the identity, quantity, and location of each of the different cell types that make up a tumor and its microenvironment? An ideal system to address this question will have the following characteristics: 1) images and data should be obtained from human patients; 2) the relationship between imaging and cytotypes should have clinical relevance; 3) there should be a large amount and a balance in data obtained from within cancerous and non-cancerous volumes; 4) the image data should be of high quality and ideally multiparametric; and 5) registration of histology to radiographic images must be feasible. Such criteria are met in prostate cancer patients who are being monitored by active surveillance (AS). The University of Miami (UM) has a large AS population, and patients with prostate cancer are regularly and routinely imaged with multiparametric MRI (MP- MRI) that includes diffusion (DWI), dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) and T2 weighted (T2w) imaging sequences as standard of care (SOC). These images are fused to a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance instrument for biopsy localization. The singular goal of the current work is to develop predictive models that define this interrelationshi based on profound image analyses (""radiomics"") in combination with quantitative histology and immunohistochemistry from spatially co-registered volumes; thus defining the ""cytotypes"" giving rise to MR image data. Researchers at the Moffitt Cancer Center have pioneered the application of radiomics and predictive (classifier like) modeling to cancer. Thus, this work will proceed with two interrelated aims. In Aim 1, MR images, histology, gene expression and clinical data will be generated at UM via the MAST Trial: MRI- Guided Biopsy Selection for Active Surveillance versus Treatment. In Aim 2, informatics data analysis, databasing and classifier modeling will be undertaken at Moffitt. Analysis of MR images will use a ""radiomics"" approach, wherein 432 size, shape and texture features are extracted from image-identified habitats. These will be matched up to registered histology images analyzed with quantitative pathology wherein 32 features are extracted from each cell to form clusters of similar morphotypes, as well as IHC for known and putative progression markers. From these quantitative markers, training and test set classifier models will be developed to relate the MR-defined habitats to their underlying mixtures of cytotypes. Because this will be a large and invaluable data base, it is our explicit intention to share the complete dataset, with the research community through material transfer agreements, which will allow alternative data mining schema. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Virtually every cancer patient is imaged with CT, PET or MRI. Importantly, such imaging reveals that tumors are complex and heterogeneous, often containing multiple ""habitats"" within them. It is the intention of this research to deeply analyze these image so we can infer what is the cellular and molecular structure in each of these habitats. This will be performed in a large cohort of men with prostate cancer who are under ""active surveillance"". In other words, they have cancer, but it is not known if the cancer is life-threatening or not. Men under active surveillance receive regular MRI scans and regular biopsies. The MRI and biopsy data will be quantitatively compared in order for us to understand the cellular and molecular basis for these different habitats in cancers.",(PQC4) Habitats in Prostate Cancer,9333954,R01CA190105,"['Address', 'Area Under Curve', 'Automobile Driving', 'Benchmarking', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic radiologic examination', 'Diffusion', 'Drosophila chb protein', 'Equilibrium', 'Fermentation', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histologic', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'MCT-1 gene', 'MDM2 gene', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monitor', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Training', 'Transrectal Ultrasound', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'contrast enhanced', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data reduction', 'digital', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo imaging', 'instrument', 'interest', 'material transfer agreement', 'men', 'model building', 'molecular pathology', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'progression marker', 'prospective test', 'public health relevance', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'relational database', 'routine imaging', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tumor', 'virtual']",NCI,H.

Our study findings can provide valuable information toward understanding pathogenesis of prostate cancer and identifying genotype combinations for predicting prostate cancer aggressiveness.",Gene-Gene Interactions and Their Functional Roles in Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness,9177847,R21CA202417,"['Affect', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Androgen Metabolism', 'Androgen Receptor', 'Angiogenesis Pathway', 'Apoptosis', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'CSF1 gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Disease', 'EGF gene', 'Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor', 'Etiology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor', 'Galectin 3', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genotype', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'MicroRNAs', 'Mitochondria', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oncogenic', 'Pathogenesis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Play', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Proteins', 'Public Domains', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Solid', 'Staging', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors', 'abstracting', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'evidence base', 'gene interaction', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'improved', 'innovation', 'men', 'new therapeutic target', 'precision medicine', 'receptor', 'research study', 'screening', 'tool', 'tumor']",NCI,LSU HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER,R21,2016,147791,0.25556001121545174
"(PQC4) Habitats in Prostate Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal will address PQC-4: ""What in vivo imaging methods can be developed to portray the ""cytotype"" of a tumor defined as the identity, quantity, and location of each of the different cell types that make up a tumor and its microenvironment? An ideal system to address this question will have the following characteristics: 1) images and data should be obtained from human patients; 2) the relationship between imaging and cytotypes should have clinical relevance; 3) there should be a large amount and a balance in data obtained from within cancerous and non-cancerous volumes; 4) the image data should be of high quality and ideally multiparametric; and 5) registration of histology to radiographic images must be feasible. Such criteria are met in prostate cancer patients who are being monitored by active surveillance (AS). The University of Miami (UM) has a large AS population, and patients with prostate cancer are regularly and routinely imaged with multiparametric MRI (MP- MRI) that includes diffusion (DWI), dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) and T2 weighted (T2w) imaging sequences as standard of care (SOC). These images are fused to a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance instrument for biopsy localization. The singular goal of the current work is to develop predictive models that define this interrelationshi based on profound image analyses (""radiomics"") in combination with quantitative histology and immunohistochemistry from spatially co-registered volumes; thus defining the ""cytotypes"" giving rise to MR image data. Researchers at the Moffitt Cancer Center have pioneered the application of radiomics and predictive (classifier like) modeling to cancer. Thus, this work will proceed with two interrelated aims. In Aim 1, MR images, histology, gene expression and clinical data will be generated at UM via the MAST Trial: MRI- Guided Biopsy Selection for Active Surveillance versus Treatment. In Aim 2, informatics data analysis, databasing and classifier modeling will be undertaken at Moffitt. Analysis of MR images will use a ""radiomics"" approach, wherein 432 size, shape and texture features are extracted from image-identified habitats. These will be matched up to registered histology images analyzed with quantitative pathology wherein 32 features are extracted from each cell to form clusters of similar morphotypes, as well as IHC for known and putative progression markers. From these quantitative markers, training and test set classifier models will be developed to relate the MR-defined habitats to their underlying mixtures of cytotypes. Because this will be a large and invaluable data base, it is our explicit intention to share the complete dataset, with the research community through material transfer agreements, which will allow alternative data mining schema. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Virtually every cancer patient is imaged with CT, PET or MRI. Importantly, such imaging reveals that tumors are complex and heterogeneous, often containing multiple ""habitats"" within them. It is the intention of this research to deeply analyze these image so we can infer what is the cellular and molecular structure in each of these habitats. This will be performed in a large cohort of men with prostate cancer who are under ""active surveillance"". In other words, they have cancer, but it is not known if the cancer is life-threatening or not. Men under active surveillance receive regular MRI scans and regular biopsies. The MRI and biopsy data will be quantitatively compared in order for us to understand the cellular and molecular basis for these different habitats in cancers.",(PQC4) Habitats in Prostate Cancer,9118120,R01CA190105,"['Address', 'Area Under Curve', 'Automobile Driving', 'Benchmarking', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Drosophila chb protein', 'Equilibrium', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Chips', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Health', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'MCT-1 gene', 'MDM2 gene', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monitor', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Training', 'Transrectal Ultrasound', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data reduction', 'digital', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo imaging', 'instrument', 'interest', 'material transfer agreement', 'meetings', 'men', 'model building', 'molecular pathology', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'progression marker', 'prospective test', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'relational database', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tumor']",NCI,H.

"Big data convergence of pathology and omics for disease prognosis ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    There is a pressing need for improved means of interrogating cancer biology in order to identify markers associated with disease aggressiveness and patient outcome. While for a number of cancers, pathologic grade (morphologic appearance of cancerous tissue as assessed by a pathologist) has been found to be highly correlated with disease outcome, pathologic grade tends to suffer from significant inter-observer variability. Additionally pathologic grade alone is not useful in scenarios where two tumors may have subtle differences in their morphologic phenotype but significantly different behavior and outcome. Additionally while a number of molecular, gene expression based assays have been proposed for predicting outcome in cancers, the relatively poor to at best moderate success for these assays suggests that a solely ""omics"" driven approach for prognosis is not an optimal strategy. For most cancers, no single biomarker to date has been identified that is able to accurately and consistently stratify disease risk. This suggests a strong need for analytic and computational tools for quantitatively mining and integrating histologic image and molecular biomarkers to create fused predictors of disease risk and outcome. Such a unified approach is especially needed in cases where molecularly or morphologically similar tumors might have significantly different outcomes. This project will focus on the development of novel big data tools for processing of two key large scale data streams: 1) the high resolution (gigabyte-sized) digital images which capture pathology architecture and tissue morphology, and 2) a large set (up to tens of thousands) of molecular markers (e.g. NF-kB/p65/RelA, p-Akt (Ser473), periostin, cacna1d, ezh2, her2neu, ki67, propsa, and propsa2) found within the disease site. The ability to mine this information via innovative big data tools will allow for the creation of fused predictors of outcome and disease aggressiveness. A central hypothesis of this project is that the combination of quantitative histomorphometric and molecular features will yield a more predictive assay for evaluating disease aggressiveness compared to any single biomarker. This project will develop and evaluate the big data analysis and fusion tools in the context of evaluating disease aggressiveness for prostate cancer. Our over-arching goal is to translate big data tools to process and integrate imaging and molecular markers extracted from diseased tissue outlined by the following aims, Aim 1: Computer vision and machine learning tools for mining sub- visual image features associated with disease aggressiveness, Aim 2: Creating a fused predictor of disease aggressiveness by combining quantitative histomorphometric and molecular measurements, Aim 3: Evaluating the tools developed in Aims 1 and 2 for distinguishing between indolent and aggressive prostate cancer on data acquired from patients from across the leading urology institutions in the US including Johns Hopkins, The Cleveland Clinic, University Hospitals at CWRU, and University of Pennsylvania.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Each year, 15,000 prostate cancer patients fail curative radical prostatectomy treatment within 5 years. In this proposal, we will develop an integrated diagnostic tool using both computational analysis of high resolution prostate tissue images and the molecular profile of the tumor in order to identify patients most at risk for disease recurrence. This research will provide innovation for the development of novel image analysis tools, data integration algorithms, and fused imaging-molecular predictors which may significantly reduce cancer morbidity and mortalities via improved accuracy of diagnosis.                ",Big data convergence of pathology and omics for disease prognosis,9044354,K01ES026841,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Architecture', 'Big Data', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Categories', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell-Cell Adhesion', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'Early identification', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Gene Expression', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Healthcare', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Indolent', 'Institution', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Medical', 'Mentors', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Profiling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'NF-kappa B', 'Nomograms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Publications', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Shapes', 'Specimen', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Stream', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Treatment outcome', 'Universities', 'University Hospitals', 'Urology', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavioral outcome', 'computerized tools', 'data integration', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'digital', 'digital imaging', 'disorder risk', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'innovation', 'medical schools', 'men', 'molecular imaging', 'molecular marker', 'molecular pathology', 'molecular phenotype', 'mortality', 'novel', 'outcome forecast', 'p65', 'periostin', 'personalized medicine', 'prognostic', 'public health relevance', 'repository', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'validation studies']",NIEHS,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,80841,0.03379585448346635
"Validation of Digital Morphometry for Cancer Risk in Benign Prostate Biopsies DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the PCPT and REDUCE trials, finasteride and dutasteride significantly reduced the detection of prostate cancer (PCa) by 23 and 25% respectively, and thus established that 51-reductase inhibitors (5ARI) are the first class of drugs proven as chemopreventive agents for PCa. The actual efficacy of these drugs varies among individuals, even after considering compliance with the prescribed dosage. Better understanding of the basis for sensitivity to 5ARI chemoprevention will: 1) pave the way for development of better-tolerated and more effective agents that exploit this established mechanism, 2) allow clinicians to target responsive men, thus reducing the cost and morbidity of life-long dosage, and 3) validate specific tissue biomarkers as surrogate endpoints for Phase II trials. Our preliminary data based on direct DNA staining suggest that nuclear morphometric features that characterize 5ARI response may also define a field effect that predicts PCa in untreated men with negative biopsies. REDUCE, which was completed in 2009, provides a unique opportunity to address these questions because intermediate, on-study biopsy samples (mandatory at Years 2 and 4) were collected. Previous research indicated that 5ARIs (at higher doses for short periods) produce changes in benign prostate that resemble incomplete atrophy. Our overall goal is to apply cutting- edge imaging approaches, incorporating machine-learning for pattern recognition and multispectral analysis, to the development and validation of intermediate endpoint biomarkers in benign tissue that characterize the response to 5ARI chemoprevention as well as the risk of PCa among men with negative biopsies. We will obtain Year 2 slides and tissue blocks from a random sample of REDUCE participants with various outcomes. Aim 1: To determine the effects of dutasteride (vs. placebo) on both nuclear and architectural features in benign tissue. Aim 2: To determine whether a multivariable treatment-response score differs between subjects who develop PCa while on dutasteride and those who do not, and, Aim 3: To determine the magnitude of association between nuclear phenotype in benign biopsies, and subsequent risk of PCa in untreated men at elevated risk. Altogether, we will use 3 techniques to assess cytomorphology: a) a morphometric score based on nuclear size, shape and texture, b) expression -via quantum dot imaging - of p300 and nucleolin (two proteins with major effects on chromatin pattern and nuclear morphology) and c) mapping of architectural features (e.g., epithelial area and height) via trainable software. This will be the first work to relate the cytomorphological effects of a 5ARI, given at a chemopreventive dose level for a lengthy period, to subsequent cancer occurrence. The results will have implications for chemoprevention research and clinical practice, including the large number of U.S. men who remain at risk following a negative prostate biopsy. Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in men and strategies to prevent or inhibit its development are critically needed. The goal of the proposed research is to validate new tissue imaging methods for determining risk of prostate cancer among men who have a negative prostate biopsy and for identifying those who are most likely to benefit from life-long chemopreventive drugs.",Validation of Digital Morphometry for Cancer Risk in Benign Prostate Biopsies,8902761,R01CA155301,"['Address', 'Androgens', 'Area', 'Atrophic', 'Benign', 'Biological Assay', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Chemoprevention', 'Chemopreventive Agent', 'Chromatin', 'Computer software', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dose', 'Dutasteride', 'EP300 gene', 'Epithelial', 'Finasteride', 'Gene Expression', 'Gland', 'Goals', 'Height', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Individual', 'Intention', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Microscopy', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Nature', 'Normal Cell', 'Nuclear', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Nuclear Structure', 'Outcome', 'Oxidoreductase', 'Participant', 'Pattern', 'Pattern Recognition', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Placebo Control', 'Placebos', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prostate', 'Proteins', 'Quantum Dots', 'Randomized', 'Research', 'Resistance', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Surrogate Endpoint', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tissues', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'active method', 'base', 'cancer cell', 'cancer risk', 'clinical practice', 'cost', 'deprivation', 'digital', 'dosage', 'drug efficacy', 'imaging modality', 'indexing', 'inhibitor/antagonist', 'member', 'men', 'morphometry', 'nucleolin', 'phase 3 study', 'phase II trial', 'prevent', 'prostate biopsy', 'protein expression', 'response', 'treatment response']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO,R01,2015,346053,0.20800317725826367
"Prostate Cancer Assessment Via Integrated 3D ARFI Elasticity Imaging and Multi-Parametric MRI ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate cancer (PCA) is the most common non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, with over 186,000 new cases diagnosed and over 28,000 PCA deaths annually in the United States. Ultrasound-guided biopsy is the standard of care for confirming cancer, typically following elevated PSA levels; however, it has been estimated that up to 20% of men require three or more biopsy sessions for diagnosis, and biopsies have a high risk of hemorrhage and infection. Furthermore, biopsies are not sufficient for tumor delineation or characterization because they sparsely sample the entire organ. Regretfully, the deficiencies of biopsy have lead to over-treatment of indolent disease with radical prostatectomies, a drastic treatment that has significant risks of infection, hemorrhage, urinary incontinence, and impotence.  We are the inventors of Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI) imaging and the inventors of Shear Wave Elasticity Imaging (SWEI) methods. We have now combined those methods into ARFI-SWEI imaging sequences that define a new and novel multi-parametric ultrasonic elasticity imaging system. This multi-parametric elasticity imaging approach provides an absolute, quantitative measure of tissue stiffness, at high resolution, in 3D, using ultrasound.  We hypothesize that synergistic diagnostic information from B-mode, ARFI-SWEI and multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI, e.g., diffusion weighted imaging and MR spectroscopy imaging) enable (a) the sensitive and specific diagnosis of PCA and (b) the accurate delineation of PCA margins. We propose retrospective studies on existing 3D B-mode, ARFI-SWEI and mpMRI imaging datasets to test this hypothesis. 1         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in American men, with over 186,000 new cases and over 28,000 deaths annually.

We propose to test ARFI-SWEI's ability to replace invasive and risky biopsies for PCA diagnosis and focal treatment planning. 1            ",Prostate Cancer Assessment Via Integrated 3D ARFI Elasticity Imaging and Multi-Parametric MRI,8905274,R41CA196565,"['Acoustics', 'American', 'Award', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Businesses', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cessation of life', 'Collection', 'Computer software', 'Consult', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Elasticity', 'Funding', 'Goals', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Impotence', 'Incontinence', 'Indolent', 'Infection', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'PSA level', 'Phase', 'Probability', 'Radiation', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Resolution', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Second Primary Cancers', 'System', 'Systems Development', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Ultrasonics', 'Ultrasonography', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Urinary Incontinence', 'Work', 'cancer diagnosis', 'commercialization', 'design', 'high risk', 'image guided', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'imaging system', 'innovation', 'men', 'novel', 'open source', 'phase 2 study', 'public health relevance', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'standard of care', 'success', 'treatment planning', 'tumor']",NCI,"KITWARE, INC.",R41,2015,150002,0.11105392554389025

The University of Miami (UM) has a large AS population, and patients with prostate cancer are regularly and routinely imaged with multiparametric MRI (MP- MRI) that includes diffusion (DWI), dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) and T2 weighted (T2w) imaging sequences as standard of care (SOC). These images are fused to a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) guidance instrument for biopsy localization. The singular goal of the current work is to develop predictive models that define this interrelationshi based on profound image analyses (""radiomics"") in combination with quantitative histology and immunohistochemistry from spatially co-registered volumes; thus defining the ""cytotypes"" giving rise to MR image data. Researchers at the Moffitt Cancer Center have pioneered the application of radiomics and predictive (classifier like) modeling to cancer. Thus, this work will proceed with two interrelated aims. In Aim 1, MR images, histology, gene expression and clinical data will be generated at UM via the MAST Trial: MRI- Guided Biopsy Selection for Active Surveillance versus Treatment. In Aim 2, informatics data analysis, databasing and classifier modeling will be undertaken at Moffitt. Analysis of MR images will use a ""radiomics"" approach, wherein 432 size, shape and texture features are extracted from image-identified habitats. These will be matched up to registered histology images analyzed with quantitative pathology wherein 32 features are extracted from each cell to form clusters of similar morphotypes, as well as IHC for known and putative progression markers. From these quantitative markers, training and test set classifier models will be developed to relate the MR-defined habitats to their underlying mixtures of cytotypes. Because this will be a large and invaluable data base, it is our explicit intention to share the complete dataset, with the research community through material transfer agreements, which will allow alternative data mining schema.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Virtually every cancer patient is imaged with CT, PET or MRI. Importantly, such imaging reveals that tumors are complex and heterogeneous, often containing multiple ""habitats"" within them. It is the intention of this research to deeply analyze these image so we can infer what is the cellular and molecular structure in each of these habitats. This will be performed in a large cohort of men with prostate cancer who are under ""active surveillance"". In other words, they have cancer, but it is not known if the cancer is life-threatening or not. Men under active surveillance receive regular MRI scans and regular biopsies. The MRI and biopsy data will be quantitatively compared in order for us to understand the cellular and molecular basis for these different habitats in cancers.            ",(PQC4) Habitats in Prostate Cancer,8792110,R01CA190105,"['Address', 'Area Under Curve', 'Automobile Driving', 'Benchmarking', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blinded', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cancerous', 'Cell Extracts', 'Cells', 'Cellular Structures', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Trials', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Conduct Clinical Trials', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Deposition', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Drosophila chb protein', 'Equilibrium', 'Functional disorder', 'Gene Expression', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Hematoxylin and Eosin Staining Method', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Human', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Intention', 'Lesion', 'Life', 'Location', 'MCT-1 gene', 'MDM2 gene', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Methods', 'Mining', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monitor', 'Pathology', 'Pathology Report', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Population Surveillance', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Predictive Value', 'Process', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Proteins', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Receiver Operator Characteristics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Schedule', 'Shapes', 'Slide', 'Source', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'System', 'Testing', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Training', 'Transrectal Ultrasound', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'arm', 'base', 'cell type', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data acquisition', 'data mining', 'data reduction', 'digital', 'imaging modality', 'in vivo imaging', 'instrument', 'interest', 'material transfer agreement', 'meetings', 'men', 'molecular pathology', 'patient population', 'predictive modeling', 'prognostic', 'progression marker', 'prospective', 'public health relevance', 'relational database', 'standard of care', 'statistics', 'tumor']",NCI,H.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.

"Decision support with MRI for targeting, evaluating laser ablation for prostate c     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For a growing population of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (CaP) patients, active surveillance may be biologically or psychologically undesirable. Yet the short- and long-term complications and co-morbidities associated with radical whole-organ therapies (e.g. intensity modulated radiation therapy) are still associated with a risk of treatment-related morbidity. With radical whole gland therapies, in certain patients who are more sensitive to radiation treatment, high dosage spots in the rectum and in the bladder can lead to complications including chronic rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms such as cystitis. Laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a novel form of controlled, targeted thermal ablation that may offer measurable advantages over other ablative therapies for focal prostate therapy. Because LITT is MRI compatible, it enables an imaging advantage over other surgical or ablation techniques that utilize transrectal ultrasound to target and monitor treatment. However successful adoption of focal therapy for the treatment of CaP will hinge on several critical issues: 1) Can we accurately identify index lesions and cancers within the prostate? 2) Appropriate follow-up of patients treated with focal therapy and 3) How to detect recurrent/persistent disease? The introduction of multi-parametric (MP) MRI (T2w, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), Diffusion (DWI)) has allowed for (1) improved detection sensitivity and specificity for CaP localization, and (2) evaluating treatment response in the prostate. However there exists a need for (1) novel computational image analysis tools to quantitatively integrate MP-MRI parameters for improved CaP classification in vivo and (2) non-rigid registration tools for enabling targeted therapy and evaluation of post-treatment changes.  In this study we will employ sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic (CAD) and deformable registration tools in conjunction with MP-MRI to be used in conjunction with a small clinical trial involving 40 patients with documented CaP for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI to thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via LITT, and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation. Regions identified via CAD on pre-LITT MRI will be targeted for therapy, while on post-LITT MP-MRI, regions identified as being suspicious for CaP recurrence (on account of large changes in MR imaging markers) will be evaluated via needle core biopsy. The tools developed in this project will be integrated into a practical and feasible treatment paradigm for focal treatment of low-risk localized CaP which will allow patients to avoid the complications associated with radical whole-gland therapy. This inter-disciplinary, translational project combines engineering expertise in terms of CAD on MP-MRI, multimodal image registration and machine learning and clinical expertise in interventional radiology, prostate MRI, and MRI guided focal therapy.          In this study we will leverage sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic and deformable registration tools in conjunction with multi-parametric (MP) MRI in prostate cancer (CaP) patients for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI and thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation.

"Validation of Digital Morphometry for Cancer Risk in Benign Prostate Biopsies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the PCPT and REDUCE trials, finasteride and dutasteride significantly reduced the detection of prostate cancer (PCa) by 23 and 25% respectively, and thus established that 51-reductase inhibitors (5ARI) are the first class of drugs proven as chemopreventive agents for PCa. The actual efficacy of these drugs varies among individuals, even after considering compliance with the prescribed dosage. Better understanding of the basis for sensitivity to 5ARI chemoprevention will: 1) pave the way for development of better-tolerated and more effective agents that exploit this established mechanism, 2) allow clinicians to target responsive men, thus reducing the cost and morbidity of life-long dosage, and 3) validate specific tissue biomarkers as surrogate endpoints for Phase II trials. Our preliminary data based on direct DNA staining suggest that nuclear morphometric features that characterize 5ARI response may also define a field effect that predicts PCa in untreated men with negative biopsies. REDUCE, which was completed in 2009, provides a unique opportunity to address these questions because intermediate, on-study biopsy samples (mandatory at Years 2 and 4) were collected. Previous research indicated that 5ARIs (at higher doses for short periods) produce changes in benign prostate that resemble incomplete atrophy. Our overall goal is to apply cutting- edge imaging approaches, incorporating machine-learning for pattern recognition and multispectral analysis, to the development and validation of intermediate endpoint biomarkers in benign tissue that characterize the response to 5ARI chemoprevention as well as the risk of PCa among men with negative biopsies. We will obtain Year 2 slides and tissue blocks from a random sample of REDUCE participants with various outcomes. Aim 1: To determine the effects of dutasteride (vs. placebo) on both nuclear and architectural features in benign tissue. Aim 2: To determine whether a multivariable treatment-response score differs between subjects who develop PCa while on dutasteride and those who do not, and, Aim 3: To determine the magnitude of association between nuclear phenotype in benign biopsies, and subsequent risk of PCa in untreated men at elevated risk. Altogether, we will use 3 techniques to assess cytomorphology: a) a morphometric score based on nuclear size, shape and texture, b) expression -via quantum dot imaging - of p300 and nucleolin (two proteins with major effects on chromatin pattern and nuclear morphology) and c) mapping of architectural features (e.g., epithelial area and height) via trainable software. This will be the first work to relate the cytomorphological effects of a 5ARI, given at a chemopreventive dose level for a lengthy period, to subsequent cancer occurrence. The results will have implications for chemoprevention research and clinical practice, including the large number of U.S. men who remain at risk following a negative prostate biopsy.        Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in men and strategies to prevent or inhibit its development are critically needed. The goal of the proposed research is to validate new tissue imaging methods for determining risk of prostate cancer among men who have a negative prostate biopsy and for identifying those who are most likely to benefit from life-long chemopreventive drugs.

"Software to facilitate multimode, multiscale fused data for Pathology and Radiolo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical informatics from the macro- to micro-scale is increasingly available for a range of detection/diagnosis/theragnostic applications tailored to each patient's history and current condition. Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the second most common malignancy among men with an estimated 220,000 new cases in the USA in 2008. With the advent of multi-parametric high resolution (3 Tesla (T)) prostate MRI, providing anatomic, biochemical, and physiologic information, it has become increasingly important to identify the potential value of this information in pre-operative or pre-therapeutic CAP screening. However, in vivo prostate MRI lacks the resolution and ground truth diagnostic accuracy histopathological examination of biopsy cores provides. A first step toward getting prostate MRI for CAP into the clinic would be validating the information provided from MR at the cellular level. However, validating MRI against histological ground truth currently lacks the means to link the information provided by radiological imaging and pathology seamlessly. This is primarily due to a lack of interoperability between informatics representations and tools. One missing element, for instance, is robust and accurate image registration tools to align the multi-modal volumetric data sets. The overarching goal of this collaborative project between the University of Pennsylvania, Rutgers University, and Siemens Corporate Research is to develop and evaluate multi-modal image analysis and machine learning techniques within a software framework that will enable efficient analysis, correlation, and interpretation of multi-functional, multi-resolution patient data. The availability of these multi-modal, multi- scale analysis tools will enable alignment of radiology and pathological data which in turn will (a) enable building and validation of supervised computerized decision support systems for detection and grading of CAP from radiology and pathology data and (b) building meta-classifiers for CAP by integrating multi- modal, multi-scale disease signatures. Such a set of prostate-specific informatics tools promises clinical benefits including improved patient prognoses, more accurate disease diagnoses, and therapeutic recommendations. More generally, the tools developed as part of this project will also enable radiologic/pathologic studies in other disease entities. The specific goals of this project are 1) to develop cross-platform, open source, grid-enabled annotation, image analysis and image registration tools that will enable cross modality validation of radiology data (multi-functional 3 T prostate MRI) with expert histopathological annotation of prostatectomy specimens and provide independent computer-aided predictions of cancer extent and grade on radiology and histopathology, 2) curate an open source caGRID- connected database of prostate MRI and histopathological specimens that will enable development of quantitative signatures for detection and grading of CAP across multiple scales and imaging modalities.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a software tool kit (based on the XIP application from Siemens corporation) that will allow scientists to study prostate cancer by combining data from multiple imaging modalities (radiology and pathology) with molecular methodologies (including proteins, genes, epigenetic data). The results of this fused and combined data sets will allow scientists to create a more robust system based view of prostate cancer which allow prediction of diagnosis, follow outcomes of therapeutic treatment and facilitate discovery of new treatment options         ","Software to facilitate multimode, multiscale fused data for Pathology and Radiolo",8512667,R01CA136535,"['Active Learning', 'Algorithms', 'American Cancer Society', 'Anatomy', 'Architecture', 'Biochemical', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computer Assisted', 'Computer software', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Decision Support Systems', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Explosion', 'Gene Proteins', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Healthcare', 'Histology', 'Histopathology', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Informatics', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical', 'Medical Informatics', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Molecular', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Physiological', 'Population', 'Premalignant', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Adenocarcinoma', 'Prostatectomy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Recommendation', 'Recording of previous events', 'Research', 'Research Infrastructure', 'Resolution', 'Schedule', 'Scientist', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Software Tools', 'Source', 'Specimen', 'Stream', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'United States', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Weight', 'Work', 'anticancer research', 'base', 'cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid', 'cancer imaging', 'computerized', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'disease diagnosis', 'image registration', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'interoperability', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'novel', 'open source', 'outcome forecast', 'pre-clinical', 'radiologist', 'repository', 'screening', 'spectroscopic imaging', 'tool']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2013,569321,0.16236016802744124

"Validation of Digital Morphometry for Cancer Risk in Benign Prostate Biopsies    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the PCPT and REDUCE trials, finasteride and dutasteride significantly reduced the detection of prostate cancer (PCa) by 23 and 25% respectively, and thus established that 51-reductase inhibitors (5ARI) are the first class of drugs proven as chemopreventive agents for PCa. The actual efficacy of these drugs varies among individuals, even after considering compliance with the prescribed dosage. Better understanding of the basis for sensitivity to 5ARI chemoprevention will: 1) pave the way for development of better-tolerated and more effective agents that exploit this established mechanism, 2) allow clinicians to target responsive men, thus reducing the cost and morbidity of life-long dosage, and 3) validate specific tissue biomarkers as surrogate endpoints for Phase II trials. Our preliminary data based on direct DNA staining suggest that nuclear morphometric features that characterize 5ARI response may also define a field effect that predicts PCa in untreated men with negative biopsies. REDUCE, which was completed in 2009, provides a unique opportunity to address these questions because intermediate, on-study biopsy samples (mandatory at Years 2 and 4) were collected. Previous research indicated that 5ARIs (at higher doses for short periods) produce changes in benign prostate that resemble incomplete atrophy. Our overall goal is to apply cutting- edge imaging approaches, incorporating machine-learning for pattern recognition and multispectral analysis, to the development and validation of intermediate endpoint biomarkers in benign tissue that characterize the response to 5ARI chemoprevention as well as the risk of PCa among men with negative biopsies. We will obtain Year 2 slides and tissue blocks from a random sample of REDUCE participants with various outcomes. Aim 1: To determine the effects of dutasteride (vs. placebo) on both nuclear and architectural features in benign tissue. Aim 2: To determine whether a multivariable treatment-response score differs between subjects who develop PCa while on dutasteride and those who do not, and, Aim 3: To determine the magnitude of association between nuclear phenotype in benign biopsies, and subsequent risk of PCa in untreated men at elevated risk. Altogether, we will use 3 techniques to assess cytomorphology: a) a morphometric score based on nuclear size, shape and texture, b) expression -via quantum dot imaging - of p300 and nucleolin (two proteins with major effects on chromatin pattern and nuclear morphology) and c) mapping of architectural features (e.g., epithelial area and height) via trainable software. This will be the first work to relate the cytomorphological effects of a 5ARI, given at a chemopreventive dose level for a lengthy period, to subsequent cancer occurrence. The results will have implications for chemoprevention research and clinical practice, including the large number of U.S. men who remain at risk following a negative prostate biopsy.        Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in men and strategies to prevent or inhibit its development are critically needed.

"Software to facilitate multimode, multiscale fused data for Pathology and Radiolo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical informatics from the macro- to micro-scale is increasingly available for a range of detection/diagnosis/theragnostic applications tailored to each patient's history and current condition. Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the second most common malignancy among men with an estimated 220,000 new cases in the USA in 2008. With the advent of multi-parametric high resolution (3 Tesla (T)) prostate MRI, providing anatomic, biochemical, and physiologic information, it has become increasingly important to identify the potential value of this information in pre-operative or pre-therapeutic CAP screening. However, in vivo prostate MRI lacks the resolution and ground truth diagnostic accuracy histopathological examination of biopsy cores provides. A first step toward getting prostate MRI for CAP into the clinic would be validating the information provided from MR at the cellular level. However, validating MRI against histological ground truth currently lacks the means to link the information provided by radiological imaging and pathology seamlessly. This is primarily due to a lack of interoperability between informatics representations and tools. One missing element, for instance, is robust and accurate image registration tools to align the multi-modal volumetric data sets. The overarching goal of this collaborative project between the University of Pennsylvania, Rutgers University, and Siemens Corporate Research is to develop and evaluate multi-modal image analysis and machine learning techniques within a software framework that will enable efficient analysis, correlation, and interpretation of multi-functional, multi-resolution patient data. The availability of these multi-modal, multi- scale analysis tools will enable alignment of radiology and pathological data which in turn will (a) enable building and validation of supervised computerized decision support systems for detection and grading of CAP from radiology and pathology data and (b) building meta-classifiers for CAP by integrating multi- modal, multi-scale disease signatures. Such a set of prostate-specific informatics tools promises clinical benefits including improved patient prognoses, more accurate disease diagnoses, and therapeutic recommendations. More generally, the tools developed as part of this project will also enable radiologic/pathologic studies in other disease entities. The specific goals of this project are 1) to develop cross-platform, open source, grid-enabled annotation, image analysis and image registration tools that will enable cross modality validation of radiology data (multi-functional 3 T prostate MRI) with expert histopathological annotation of prostatectomy specimens and provide independent computer-aided predictions of cancer extent and grade on radiology and histopathology, 2) curate an open source caGRID- connected database of prostate MRI and histopathological specimens that will enable development of quantitative signatures for detection and grading of CAP across multiple scales and imaging modalities.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a software tool kit (based on the XIP application from Siemens corporation) that will allow scientists to study prostate cancer by combining data from multiple imaging modalities (radiology and pathology) with molecular methodologies (including proteins, genes, epigenetic data).

"Decision support with MRI for targeting, evaluating laser ablation for prostate c     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): For a growing population of low- and intermediate-risk prostate cancer (CaP) patients, active surveillance may be biologically or psychologically undesirable. Yet the short- and long-term complications and co-morbidities associated with radical whole-organ therapies (e.g. intensity modulated radiation therapy) are still associated with a risk of treatment-related morbidity. With radical whole gland therapies, in certain patients who are more sensitive to radiation treatment, high dosage spots in the rectum and in the bladder can lead to complications including chronic rectal bleeding, diarrhea, and urinary symptoms such as cystitis. Laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) is a novel form of controlled, targeted thermal ablation that may offer measurable advantages over other ablative therapies for focal prostate therapy. Because LITT is MRI compatible, it enables an imaging advantage over other surgical or ablation techniques that utilize transrectal ultrasound to target and monitor treatment. However successful adoption of focal therapy for the treatment of CaP will hinge on several critical issues: 1) Can we accurately identify index lesions and cancers within the prostate? 2) Appropriate follow-up of patients treated with focal therapy and 3) How to detect recurrent/persistent disease? The introduction of multi-parametric (MP) MRI (T2w, dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE), Diffusion (DWI)) has allowed for (1) improved detection sensitivity and specificity for CaP localization, and (2) evaluating treatment response in the prostate. However there exists a need for (1) novel computational image analysis tools to quantitatively integrate MP-MRI parameters for improved CaP classification in vivo and (2) non-rigid registration tools for enabling targeted therapy and evaluation of post-treatment changes.  In this study we will employ sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic (CAD) and deformable registration tools in conjunction with MP-MRI to be used in conjunction with a small clinical trial involving 40 patients with documented CaP for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI to thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via LITT, and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation. Regions identified via CAD on pre-LITT MRI will be targeted for therapy, while on post-LITT MP-MRI, regions identified as being suspicious for CaP recurrence (on account of large changes in MR imaging markers) will be evaluated via needle core biopsy. The tools developed in this project will be integrated into a practical and feasible treatment paradigm for focal treatment of low-risk localized CaP which will allow patients to avoid the complications associated with radical whole-gland therapy. This inter-disciplinary, translational project combines engineering expertise in terms of CAD on MP-MRI, multimodal image registration and machine learning and clinical expertise in interventional radiology, prostate MRI, and MRI guided focal therapy.          In this study we will leverage sophisticated computer vision, image analysis, computer assisted diagnostic and deformable registration tools in conjunction with multi-parametric (MP) MRI in prostate cancer (CaP) patients for (a) automated delineation of tumor regions on pre-treatment MP-MRI and thereby identify the specific regions for ablation via laser induced interstitial thermal therapy (LITT), and (b) identify and delineate locally recurrent disease within and outside the ablation zone for post-LITT evaluation.

"Genetic & epigenetic analysis of angiogenesis genes in recurrent prostate cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate is the most common site of cancer in men in the United States. Most prostate cancers progress relatively slowly and stay confined within the prostate. However, some cases grow aggressively and metastasize to other parts of the body. The most important clinical challenge in the treatment of the disease is the not knowing which of these two clinical forms a patient is presenting with. This is critically important information given the significant morbidity associated with treatment interventions and could eventually help distinguish men who need intensive treatment from those who may be better served by watchful waiting. Currently, the level of serum PSA, clinical stage and Gleason score are used to estimate prognosis and inform treatment modalities. Although they are very useful, additional biomarkers may help to better predict the outcome of prostate cancer. Carefully designed molecular epidemiologic studies can contribute in this arena. Although the significance of angiogenesis in prostate cancer is demonstrated by its correlation with clinical features, such as clinical stage, Gleason scores, progression, metastasis and survival, relatively few studies have assessed the role of genes involved in the angiogenesis pathway with recurrence of prostate cancer. Research to identify the specific genes and genetic variants relevant to angiogenesis risk remain largely unexplored. Part of the reason why candidate gene studies have been inconclusive may be that a major source of genetic regulation has been ignored: gene silencing through DNA methylation. Our hypothesis is that genetic and epigenetic individual variation in genes involved in the angiogenesis pathway is associated with recurrence of prostate cancer. The ultimate goal of this study is to identify biomarkers that can be used at the time of diagnosis to predict prognosis and improve clinical treatment decision making. The proposed study involves (1) construction of a historical cohort of prostate cancer cases (n=~1300) treated with radical prostatectomy at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center between 1987 and 2003, (2) evaluating the association between 802 SNPs in 52 genes involved in angiogenesis with risk of recurrent prostate cancer, (3) evaluating the association between DNA methylation in the promoter regions of angiogenesis genes and risk for recurrence of prostate cancer and (4) testing the combined effects of inherited and acquired genetic changes in the candidate genes on disease aggressiveness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies will provide key information regarding the potential effect of epigenetic genetic variations on prostate cancer recurrence. The combination of the individual's epigenetic and genetic profile and a current prediction model can possibly estimate a more accurate recurrence risk of the prostate cancer patients. This model can be extremely useful for a strategy of prostate cancer treatment.                               n/a",Genetic & epigenetic analysis of angiogenesis genes in recurrent prostate cancer,8260568,R01CA128813,"['5 year old', 'Algorithms', 'Angiogenesis Pathway', 'Area Under Curve', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Body part', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Formalin', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Hazard Models', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphatic System', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Records', 'Methylation', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nomograms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Promoter Regions', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Staging', 'TNM', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'outcome forecast', 'tumor']",NCI,H.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.

A first step toward getting prostate MRI for CAP into the clinic would be validating the information provided from MR at the cellular level. However, validating MRI against histological ground truth currently lacks the means to link the information provided by radiological imaging and pathology seamlessly. This is primarily due to a lack of interoperability between informatics representations and tools. One missing element, for instance, is robust and accurate image registration tools to align the multi-modal volumetric data sets. The overarching goal of this collaborative project between the University of Pennsylvania, Rutgers University, and Siemens Corporate Research is to develop and evaluate multi-modal image analysis and machine learning techniques within a software framework that will enable efficient analysis, correlation, and interpretation of multi-functional, multi-resolution patient data. The availability of these multi-modal, multi- scale analysis tools will enable alignment of radiology and pathological data which in turn will (a) enable building and validation of supervised computerized decision support systems for detection and grading of CAP from radiology and pathology data and (b) building meta-classifiers for CAP by integrating multi- modal, multi-scale disease signatures. Such a set of prostate-specific informatics tools promises clinical benefits including improved patient prognoses, more accurate disease diagnoses, and therapeutic recommendations. More generally, the tools developed as part of this project will also enable radiologic/pathologic studies in other disease entities. The specific goals of this project are 1) to develop cross-platform, open source, grid-enabled annotation, image analysis and image registration tools that will enable cross modality validation of radiology data (multi-functional 3 T prostate MRI) with expert histopathological annotation of prostatectomy specimens and provide independent computer-aided predictions of cancer extent and grade on radiology and histopathology, 2) curate an open source caGRID- connected database of prostate MRI and histopathological specimens that will enable development of quantitative signatures for detection and grading of CAP across multiple scales and imaging modalities.

"""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The availability of high-dimensional single-nucleotide (SNP) data for large samples of individuals with and without disease presents unprecedented opportunities for genetic epidemiologists, but also many statistical challenges. Our ability to bring these opportunities to fruition depends on the development and application of sound and innovative statistical methods. Areas of particularly great need include methods for dealing with multiple hypothesis-testing problems (multiple comparison issues), and methods for combining data from multiple sources to achieve sharper inferences (data synthesis issues). The goals of this research are to develop new or improved methods for addressing these issues, and to apply them to data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will build on more than 15 years of previous work. Specifically, in 1988 the National Cancer Institute (NCI) awarded an Outstanding Investigator Grant (OIG) to the Principle Investigator for the development and application of new and improved statistical methods for use in epidemiological research. In 1995 this grant was renewed until NCI terminated the program in 2001. The research was then funded by R01 CA94069 for the period January 2002 to December 2006. This competing renewal application requests funds to continue this work and to apply it to new areas of emerging importance. The specific aims are fourfold: 1) to evaluate new and existing methods for controlling confounding and tail count variability in case-control genome-wide association (GWA) studies; 2) to evaluate risks associated with missense mutations of unknown significance in genes of established disease relevance; 3) to combine multiple independent sources of data in assessing the joint carcinogenic effects of groups of genes; and 4) to integrate data on tumor and patient characteristics for improved assessment of phenotype-specific etiology. We will evaluate the new methods by simulations, and we will illustrate them by application to existing data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate, and emerging data from GWA studies of breast and prostate cancer. The existing data have been collected either by the investigators and the consultants to this project, or as part of three collaborations in which the investigators participate: the Breast Cancer Family Registry (Breast-CFR), the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), and the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). In summary, we need sound, reliable methods for analyzing the vast amounts of emerging genetic data from individuals with and without a given type of cancer. The goals of this research are to develop such methods, and thereby to help generate new knowledge useful for cancer prevention and treatment.                                         n/a","""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""",8120480,R01CA094069,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Area', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Breast', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nucleotides', 'Odds Ratio', 'Output', 'Ovary', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prostate', 'Registries', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Study Section', 'Suggestion', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'acronyms', 'base', 'breast cancer family registry', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer type', 'case control', 'computer program', 'conditioning', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'sound', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,558584,0.04679055529751026
"Genetic & epigenetic analysis of angiogenesis genes in recurrent prostate cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate is the most common site of cancer in men in the United States. Most prostate cancers progress relatively slowly and stay confined within the prostate. However, some cases grow aggressively and metastasize to other parts of the body. The most important clinical challenge in the treatment of the disease is the not knowing which of these two clinical forms a patient is presenting with. This is critically important information given the significant morbidity associated with treatment interventions and could eventually help distinguish men who need intensive treatment from those who may be better served by watchful waiting. Currently, the level of serum PSA, clinical stage and Gleason score are used to estimate prognosis and inform treatment modalities. Although they are very useful, additional biomarkers may help to better predict the outcome of prostate cancer. Carefully designed molecular epidemiologic studies can contribute in this arena. Although the significance of angiogenesis in prostate cancer is demonstrated by its correlation with clinical features, such as clinical stage, Gleason scores, progression, metastasis and survival, relatively few studies have assessed the role of genes involved in the angiogenesis pathway with recurrence of prostate cancer. Research to identify the specific genes and genetic variants relevant to angiogenesis risk remain largely unexplored. Part of the reason why candidate gene studies have been inconclusive may be that a major source of genetic regulation has been ignored: gene silencing through DNA methylation. Our hypothesis is that genetic and epigenetic individual variation in genes involved in the angiogenesis pathway is associated with recurrence of prostate cancer. The ultimate goal of this study is to identify biomarkers that can be used at the time of diagnosis to predict prognosis and improve clinical treatment decision making. The proposed study involves (1) construction of a historical cohort of prostate cancer cases (n=~1300) treated with radical prostatectomy at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center between 1987 and 2003, (2) evaluating the association between 802 SNPs in 52 genes involved in angiogenesis with risk of recurrent prostate cancer, (3) evaluating the association between DNA methylation in the promoter regions of angiogenesis genes and risk for recurrence of prostate cancer and (4) testing the combined effects of inherited and acquired genetic changes in the candidate genes on disease aggressiveness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies will provide key information regarding the potential effect of epigenetic genetic variations on prostate cancer recurrence. The combination of the individual's epigenetic and genetic profile and a current prediction model can possibly estimate a more accurate recurrence risk of the prostate cancer patients. This model can be extremely useful for a strategy of prostate cancer treatment.                               n/a",Genetic & epigenetic analysis of angiogenesis genes in recurrent prostate cancer,8098046,R01CA128813,"['5 year old', 'Algorithms', 'Angiogenesis Pathway', 'Area Under Curve', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Body part', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Formalin', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Hazard Models', 'Health', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphatic System', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Records', 'Methylation', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nomograms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Promoter Regions', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'RNA', 'Race', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Staging', 'TNM', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'outcome forecast', 'tumor']",NCI,H.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy.

"Genetics Variants in the Genome Predisposing to Aggressive PCa DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fortunately, most men diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) will not die from their disease, and some men diagnosed may not even require treatment for their cancers. However, on the other end of the spectrum, ~30,000 men annually die from PCa in the US alone. For these latter men, the concept of PCa as an indolent disease obviously does not apply. Understanding the molecular basis of aggressive PCa (aPCa) vs. indolent PCa (non-aPCa) is perhaps the most important basic, yet translational question in PCa biology. We hypothesize that multiple sequence variants in the genome confer risk to aPCa but not to non-aPCa. Taking advantage of the publicly available CGEMS genome wide association data, as well as the large and unique PCa patient population at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH), we propose a systematic genetic association study to confirm, fine map, and better characterize genetic risk variants for aPCa. We propose three specific aims: 1)Test the genetic variants implicated in the CGEMS study that distinguish aPCa from non-aPCa among ~3,000 aPCa and ~5,000 non-aPCa patients of European ancestry from the JHH, 2) Fine map the genomic regions for the SNPs implicated in Aim 1 among 3,000 aPCa and 5,000 non-aPCa patients of European ancestry from the JHH, and 3) Assess the association of the most significant SNPs found in Aim 2 with disease characteristics in all 8,000 patients, and with disease progression in a subset of patients that have follow-up data at JHH. In addition, we have two exploratory aims: 1) fine mapping of regions containing SNPs significant in European Americans in aPCa and non-aPCa in African Americans, and 2) testing for gene-gene interaction. Besides the obvious clues that the proposed research may provide in terms of etiologic mechanisms, this study may also lead to identification of new target genes and proteins for therapy and possible preventive strategies. Furthermore, the identification of multiple variants can lead to the development of a test panel that may improve prediction of aPCa risk. Project Narrative  Prostate cancer is a common cancer that varies widely in its aggressiveness. The ability to predict which men  are at risk for the development of aggressive prostate cancer is urgently needed. This proposal addresses the  possibility that genetic variants may differentiate risk for aggressive from non-aggressive prostate cancer and  the results can be used to predict men at higher risk for aggressive prostate cancer.",Genetics Variants in the Genome Predisposing to Aggressive PCa,8037735,R01CA133009,"['17q', '17q12', '17q24.3', '8q24', 'Address', 'Adjuvant Therapy', 'Affect', 'African American', 'Age', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biology', 'Cancer Biology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Cohort Studies', 'Collaborations', 'Core Biopsy', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Disease Progression', 'European', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Hospitals', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Investments', 'Joints', 'Lead', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Organ', 'Pathologic', 'Pathological Staging', 'Pathologist', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Physicians', 'Policies', 'Population', 'Population Study', 'Predisposition', 'Prevention strategy', 'Procedures', 'Productivity', 'Property', 'Prostate', 'Publications', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Radiation', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recording of previous events', 'Recruitment Activity', 'Regression Analysis', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling Errors', 'Severity of illness', 'Staging', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'analytical method', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer risk', 'clinical phenotype', 'cohort', 'data mining', 'data sharing', 'design', 'disease characteristic', 'disease natural history', 'experience', 'follow-up', 'forest', 'gene interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic linkage', 'genetic linkage analysis', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'genome-wide linkage', 'high risk', 'high risk men', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'men', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'patient population', 'success', 'therapeutic target', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,585183,0.14352746779889106

The goals of this research are to develop such methods, and thereby to help generate new knowledge useful for cancer prevention and treatment.                                         n/a","""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""",7936896,R01CA094069,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Area', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Breast', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nucleotides', 'Odds Ratio', 'Output', 'Ovary', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prostate', 'Registries', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Study Section', 'Suggestion', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'acronyms', 'base', 'breast cancer family registry', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer type', 'case control', 'computer program', 'conditioning', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'sound', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,580133,0.04679055529751026
"Genetic & epigenetic analysis of angiogenesis genes in recurrent prostate cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate is the most common site of cancer in men in the United States. Most prostate cancers progress relatively slowly and stay confined within the prostate. However, some cases grow aggressively and metastasize to other parts of the body. The most important clinical challenge in the treatment of the disease is the not knowing which of these two clinical forms a patient is presenting with. This is critically important information given the significant morbidity associated with treatment interventions and could eventually help distinguish men who need intensive treatment from those who may be better served by watchful waiting. Currently, the level of serum PSA, clinical stage and Gleason score are used to estimate prognosis and inform treatment modalities. Although they are very useful, additional biomarkers may help to better predict the outcome of prostate cancer. Carefully designed molecular epidemiologic studies can contribute in this arena. Although the significance of angiogenesis in prostate cancer is demonstrated by its correlation with clinical features, such as clinical stage, Gleason scores, progression, metastasis and survival, relatively few studies have assessed the role of genes involved in the angiogenesis pathway with recurrence of prostate cancer. Research to identify the specific genes and genetic variants relevant to angiogenesis risk remain largely unexplored. Part of the reason why candidate gene studies have been inconclusive may be that a major source of genetic regulation has been ignored: gene silencing through DNA methylation. Our hypothesis is that genetic and epigenetic individual variation in genes involved in the angiogenesis pathway is associated with recurrence of prostate cancer. The ultimate goal of this study is to identify biomarkers that can be used at the time of diagnosis to predict prognosis and improve clinical treatment decision making. The proposed study involves (1) construction of a historical cohort of prostate cancer cases (n=~1300) treated with radical prostatectomy at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center between 1987 and 2003, (2) evaluating the association between 802 SNPs in 52 genes involved in angiogenesis with risk of recurrent prostate cancer, (3) evaluating the association between DNA methylation in the promoter regions of angiogenesis genes and risk for recurrence of prostate cancer and (4) testing the combined effects of inherited and acquired genetic changes in the candidate genes on disease aggressiveness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies will provide key information regarding the potential effect of epigenetic genetic variations on prostate cancer recurrence. The combination of the individual's epigenetic and genetic profile and a current prediction model can possibly estimate a more accurate recurrence risk of the prostate cancer patients. This model can be extremely useful for a strategy of prostate cancer treatment.                               n/a",Genetic & epigenetic analysis of angiogenesis genes in recurrent prostate cancer,7849641,R01CA128813,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Angiogenesis Pathway', 'Area Under Curve', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Body part', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Formalin', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Hazard Models', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphatic System', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Records', 'Methylation', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nomograms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Promoter Regions', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Race', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Staging', 'TNM', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'tumor']",NCI,H.

"Prostate-cancer Imaging by Combined Ultrasound and Magnetic-resonance Parameters    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance to detect PCa; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy. The project is highly significant because it addresses a major health problem in the United States and other developed countries. The project will overcome the current inability of established clinical-imaging method to image PCa reliably by combining the capabilities of advanced ultrasound (US) and magnetic-resonance (MR) techniques in a clinically effective manner. The proposed approach will exploit the sensitivity of US to mechanical properties of tissue on a microscopic scale with the sensitivity of MR to chemical constituents of tissue and its ability to sense blood distribution. Each of these modalities senses different and independent properties of tissue and has shown encouraging potential for improved imaging of PCa when used alone; combining parameters derived from each modality can provide far superior sensitivity and specificity for PCa. We will combine US and MR parameters using advanced classifiers such as artificial neural networks and support-vector machines. These classifiers already have produced ROC-curve areas of 0.91 for advanced US methods, and the MR methods have demonstrated equivalent ROC-curve areas in many studies. We will embody the combined capabilities in specifications for a prototype imaging system that can generate prostate tissue-typing images (TTIs) in real-time for targeting biopsies or planning treatment in the operating room or in an off-line setting. The latest Logiq E9 instrument currently being produced by GE already has a capability for fusing previously obtained MR images with US images in real time, which provides an existing framework for combining US and MR parameters and generating real-time TTIs. Successfully generating reliable prostate TTIs based on combined US and MR parameters will represent a quantum advance in PCa management by enabling significant improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of PCa.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Riverside Research Institute, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Rutgers University, and the General Electric Corporation propose to undertake an Academic-Industrial Partnership study to improve prostate- cancer (PCA) imaging markedly and thereby improve prostate-biopsy guidance; enhance monitoring, surveillance, and treatment of PCa; and enable planning and execution of focal PCa therapy.

"Genetics Variants in the Genome Predisposing to Aggressive PCa    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fortunately, most men diagnosed with prostate cancer (PCa) will not die from their disease, and some men diagnosed may not even require treatment for their cancers. However, on the other end of the spectrum, ~30,000 men annually die from PCa in the US alone. For these latter men, the concept of PCa as an indolent disease obviously does not apply. Understanding the molecular basis of aggressive PCa (aPCa) vs. indolent PCa (non-aPCa) is perhaps the most important basic, yet translational question in PCa biology. We hypothesize that multiple sequence variants in the genome confer risk to aPCa but not to non-aPCa. Taking advantage of the publicly available CGEMS genome wide association data, as well as the large and unique PCa patient population at Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH), we propose a systematic genetic association study to confirm, fine map, and better characterize genetic risk variants for aPCa. We propose three specific aims: 1)Test the genetic variants implicated in the CGEMS study that distinguish aPCa from non-aPCa among ~3,000 aPCa and ~5,000 non-aPCa patients of European ancestry from the JHH, 2) Fine map the genomic regions for the SNPs implicated in Aim 1 among 3,000 aPCa and 5,000 non-aPCa patients of European ancestry from the JHH, and 3) Assess the association of the most significant SNPs found in Aim 2 with disease characteristics in all 8,000 patients, and with disease progression in a subset of patients that have follow-up data at JHH. In addition, we have two exploratory aims: 1) fine mapping of regions containing SNPs significant in European Americans in aPCa and non-aPCa in African Americans, and 2) testing for gene-gene interaction. Besides the obvious clues that the proposed research may provide in terms of etiologic mechanisms, this study may also lead to identification of new target genes and proteins for therapy and possible preventive strategies. Furthermore, the identification of multiple variants can lead to the development of a test panel that may improve prediction of aPCa risk.                                                 Project Narrative  Prostate cancer is a common cancer that varies widely in its aggressiveness.

"Virtual Conversations for Prostate Cancer Decisions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this program is to improve the knowledge and awareness of patients with critical illnesses, empowering them to more actively participate in meaningful conversations with health care providers and in the decisions that must be made to remedy their current problem and improve their overall health. The specific aim of this Phase II project is to field test and refine a virtual dialogue prostate cancer patient education model involving a multidisciplinary team of experts. This unique patient education model will be accessible over the Internet. When this work is complete, patients and their families will be able to obtain accurate, reliable, comprehensive knowledge about this disease and current treatment modalities through independent virtual conversations with each of the prostate cancer experts. This project is in full support of the NIH mission of improving the health of the nation. If virtual dialogue technology were fully implemented as a unique patient education paradigm over the Internet, it could elevate the understanding patients have about health matters, and empower them with knowledge and the confidence to participate, with their health care provider, in decisions about their illness and general health. Also, this project is in full support of a primary aspect of the NCI mission regarding research in health information dissemination. Virtual dialogue technology offers the opportunity for patients to individually engage cancer experts in a systematic, reliable, multidisciplinary approach to learning about their illness. The dissemination of prostate cancer information to patients through direct, ""face-to-face"" dialogues with each practitioner in a multidisciplinary cancer clinic on a nationwide basis is unprecedented. The development and research that would lead to this phenomenon is being proposed. In Phase II, the researchers will partner with the Center for Prostate Disease Research (CPDR) clinical staff at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC). A series of virtual dialogue programs will be developed to embody the comprehensive knowledge of six essential prostate cancer experts from the CPDR multidisciplinary clinic (i.e., surgeon, radiation oncologist, urologic andrologist, etc). The series will be evaluated with regard to the feasibility of delivering this series of virtual dialogue programs over the Internet, and the patients' acceptance of this new method will be measured. Also, a usual-treatment Control group will be employed in a pre-post testing environment to assess the comparative knowledge gained by these newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and to determine if this virtual dialogue model efficaciously delivers the knowledge of these multidisciplinary prostate cancer experts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An Internet-based virtual dialogue patient education model will make the most trustworthy health practitioners available to everyone for individual ""face-to-face"" dialogues about their area of expertise. Patients will be more knowledgeable about their illnesses because of the reliable, comprehensive information they obtain directly from the mouth of the expert. The researchers believe that virtual dialogue represents a new paradigm in patient education; one in which any patient can independently engage medical experts in one-on-one, face-to-face dialogues. The patient is the active participant in the dialogue, rather than a passive, compliant listener. The key technology objective of this Phase II project is to enhance the Virtual Conversations(R) patient education system to include the ability to distribute virtual dialogue programs over the Internet. Achieving this objective will open the door to quick and easy access to the proposed multidisciplinary, prostate cancer virtual dialogue series by all cancer institutions and prostate cancer patients with access to the Internet.           PROJECT NARRATIVE - RELEVANCE An Internet-based virtual dialogue patient education model will make the most trustworthy health practitioners available to everyone for individual ""face-to-face"" dialogues about their area of expertise.

"Software to facilitate multimode, multiscale fused data for Pathology and Radiolo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Medical informatics from the macro- to micro-scale is increasingly available for a range of detection/diagnosis/theragnostic applications tailored to each patient's history and current condition. Prostatic adenocarcinoma (CAP) is the second most common malignancy among men with an estimated 220,000 new cases in the USA in 2008. With the advent of multi-parametric high resolution (3 Tesla (T)) prostate MRI, providing anatomic, biochemical, and physiologic information, it has become increasingly important to identify the potential value of this information in pre-operative or pre-therapeutic CAP screening. However, in vivo prostate MRI lacks the resolution and ground truth diagnostic accuracy histopathological examination of biopsy cores provides. A first step toward getting prostate MRI for CAP into the clinic would be validating the information provided from MR at the cellular level. However, validating MRI against histological ground truth currently lacks the means to link the information provided by radiological imaging and pathology seamlessly. This is primarily due to a lack of interoperability between informatics representations and tools. One missing element, for instance, is robust and accurate image registration tools to align the multi-modal volumetric data sets. The overarching goal of this collaborative project between the University of Pennsylvania, Rutgers University, and Siemens Corporate Research is to develop and evaluate multi-modal image analysis and machine learning techniques within a software framework that will enable efficient analysis, correlation, and interpretation of multi-functional, multi-resolution patient data. The availability of these multi-modal, multi- scale analysis tools will enable alignment of radiology and pathological data which in turn will (a) enable building and validation of supervised computerized decision support systems for detection and grading of CAP from radiology and pathology data and (b) building meta-classifiers for CAP by integrating multi- modal, multi-scale disease signatures. Such a set of prostate-specific informatics tools promises clinical benefits including improved patient prognoses, more accurate disease diagnoses, and therapeutic recommendations. More generally, the tools developed as part of this project will also enable radiologic/pathologic studies in other disease entities. The specific goals of this project are 1) to develop cross-platform, open source, grid-enabled annotation, image analysis and image registration tools that will enable cross modality validation of radiology data (multi-functional 3 T prostate MRI) with expert histopathological annotation of prostatectomy specimens and provide independent computer-aided predictions of cancer extent and grade on radiology and histopathology, 2) curate an open source caGRID- connected database of prostate MRI and histopathological specimens that will enable development of quantitative signatures for detection and grading of CAP across multiple scales and imaging modalities.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop a software tool kit (based on the XIP application from Siemens corporation) that will allow scientists to study prostate cancer by combining data from multiple imaging modalities (radiology and pathology) with molecular methodologies (including proteins, genes, epigenetic data). The results of this fused and combined data sets will allow scientists to create a more robust system based view of prostate cancer which allow prediction of diagnosis, follow outcomes of therapeutic treatment and facilitate discovery of new treatment options            The goal of this project is to develop a software tool kit (based on the XIP application from Siemens corporation) that will allow scientists to study prostate cancer by combining data from multiple imaging modalities (radiology and pathology) with molecular methodologies (including proteins, genes, epigenetic data).

"""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The availability of high-dimensional single-nucleotide (SNP) data for large samples of individuals with and without disease presents unprecedented opportunities for genetic epidemiologists, but also many statistical challenges. Our ability to bring these opportunities to fruition depends on the development and application of sound and innovative statistical methods. Areas of particularly great need include methods for dealing with multiple hypothesis-testing problems (multiple comparison issues), and methods for combining data from multiple sources to achieve sharper inferences (data synthesis issues). The goals of this research are to develop new or improved methods for addressing these issues, and to apply them to data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will build on more than 15 years of previous work. Specifically, in 1988 the National Cancer Institute (NCI) awarded an Outstanding Investigator Grant (OIG) to the Principle Investigator for the development and application of new and improved statistical methods for use in epidemiological research. In 1995 this grant was renewed until NCI terminated the program in 2001. The research was then funded by R01 CA94069 for the period January 2002 to December 2006. This competing renewal application requests funds to continue this work and to apply it to new areas of emerging importance. The specific aims are fourfold: 1) to evaluate new and existing methods for controlling confounding and tail count variability in case-control genome-wide association (GWA) studies; 2) to evaluate risks associated with missense mutations of unknown significance in genes of established disease relevance; 3) to combine multiple independent sources of data in assessing the joint carcinogenic effects of groups of genes; and 4) to integrate data on tumor and patient characteristics for improved assessment of phenotype-specific etiology. We will evaluate the new methods by simulations, and we will illustrate them by application to existing data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate, and emerging data from GWA studies of breast and prostate cancer. The existing data have been collected either by the investigators and the consultants to this project, or as part of three collaborations in which the investigators participate: the Breast Cancer Family Registry (Breast-CFR), the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), and the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). In summary, we need sound, reliable methods for analyzing the vast amounts of emerging genetic data from individuals with and without a given type of cancer. The goals of this research are to develop such methods, and thereby to help generate new knowledge useful for cancer prevention and treatment.                                         n/a","""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""",7670458,R01CA094069,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Area', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Breast', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nucleotides', 'Odds Ratio', 'Output', 'Ovary', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prostate', 'Registries', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Study Section', 'Suggestion', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'acronyms', 'base', 'breast cancer family registry', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer type', 'case control', 'computer program', 'conditioning', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'sound', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,573074,0.04679055529751026
"Genetic & epigenetic analysis of angiogenesis genes in recurrent prostate cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prostate is the most common site of cancer in men in the United States. Most prostate cancers progress relatively slowly and stay confined within the prostate. However, some cases grow aggressively and metastasize to other parts of the body. The most important clinical challenge in the treatment of the disease is the not knowing which of these two clinical forms a patient is presenting with. This is critically important information given the significant morbidity associated with treatment interventions and could eventually help distinguish men who need intensive treatment from those who may be better served by watchful waiting. Currently, the level of serum PSA, clinical stage and Gleason score are used to estimate prognosis and inform treatment modalities. Although they are very useful, additional biomarkers may help to better predict the outcome of prostate cancer. Carefully designed molecular epidemiologic studies can contribute in this arena. Although the significance of angiogenesis in prostate cancer is demonstrated by its correlation with clinical features, such as clinical stage, Gleason scores, progression, metastasis and survival, relatively few studies have assessed the role of genes involved in the angiogenesis pathway with recurrence of prostate cancer. Research to identify the specific genes and genetic variants relevant to angiogenesis risk remain largely unexplored. Part of the reason why candidate gene studies have been inconclusive may be that a major source of genetic regulation has been ignored: gene silencing through DNA methylation. Our hypothesis is that genetic and epigenetic individual variation in genes involved in the angiogenesis pathway is associated with recurrence of prostate cancer. The ultimate goal of this study is to identify biomarkers that can be used at the time of diagnosis to predict prognosis and improve clinical treatment decision making. The proposed study involves (1) construction of a historical cohort of prostate cancer cases (n=~1300) treated with radical prostatectomy at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center between 1987 and 2003, (2) evaluating the association between 802 SNPs in 52 genes involved in angiogenesis with risk of recurrent prostate cancer, (3) evaluating the association between DNA methylation in the promoter regions of angiogenesis genes and risk for recurrence of prostate cancer and (4) testing the combined effects of inherited and acquired genetic changes in the candidate genes on disease aggressiveness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: These studies will provide key information regarding the potential effect of epigenetic genetic variations on prostate cancer recurrence. The combination of the individual's epigenetic and genetic profile and a current prediction model can possibly estimate a more accurate recurrence risk of the prostate cancer patients. This model can be extremely useful for a strategy of prostate cancer treatment.                               n/a",Genetic & epigenetic analysis of angiogenesis genes in recurrent prostate cancer,7658099,R01CA128813,"['Age', 'Algorithms', 'Angiogenesis Pathway', 'Area Under Curve', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Circulation', 'Body part', 'Cancer Center', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Caucasians', 'Caucasoid Race', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'DNA', 'DNA Methylation', 'Data', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Evaluation', 'Formalin', 'Gene Silencing', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Hazard Models', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Intervention', 'Length', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Lymphatic System', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Records', 'Methylation', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Nomograms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Outcome', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient observation', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Play', 'Promoter Regions', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Race', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Receiver Operating Characteristics', 'Recurrence', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Institute', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Staging', 'TNM', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Trees', 'Tumor Tissue', 'United States', 'Variant', 'abstracting', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'bone', 'cancer recurrence', 'cancer site', 'cancer therapy', 'case control', 'cohort', 'design', 'follow-up', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic variant', 'improved', 'men', 'mortality', 'neoplasm registry', 'outcome forecast', 'public health relevance', 'tumor']",NCI,H.

"Virtual Conversations for Prostate Cancer Decisions    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad, long-term objective of this program is to improve the knowledge and awareness of patients with critical illnesses, empowering them to more actively participate in meaningful conversations with health care providers and in the decisions that must be made to remedy their current problem and improve their overall health. The specific aim of this Phase II project is to field test and refine a virtual dialogue prostate cancer patient education model involving a multidisciplinary team of experts. This unique patient education model will be accessible over the Internet. When this work is complete, patients and their families will be able to obtain accurate, reliable, comprehensive knowledge about this disease and current treatment modalities through independent virtual conversations with each of the prostate cancer experts. This project is in full support of the NIH mission of improving the health of the nation. If virtual dialogue technology were fully implemented as a unique patient education paradigm over the Internet, it could elevate the understanding patients have about health matters, and empower them with knowledge and the confidence to participate, with their health care provider, in decisions about their illness and general health. Also, this project is in full support of a primary aspect of the NCI mission regarding research in health information dissemination. Virtual dialogue technology offers the opportunity for patients to individually engage cancer experts in a systematic, reliable, multidisciplinary approach to learning about their illness. The dissemination of prostate cancer information to patients through direct, ""face-to-face"" dialogues with each practitioner in a multidisciplinary cancer clinic on a nationwide basis is unprecedented. The development and research that would lead to this phenomenon is being proposed. In Phase II, the researchers will partner with the Center for Prostate Disease Research (CPDR) clinical staff at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAMC). A series of virtual dialogue programs will be developed to embody the comprehensive knowledge of six essential prostate cancer experts from the CPDR multidisciplinary clinic (i.e., surgeon, radiation oncologist, urologic andrologist, etc). The series will be evaluated with regard to the feasibility of delivering this series of virtual dialogue programs over the Internet, and the patients' acceptance of this new method will be measured. Also, a usual-treatment Control group will be employed in a pre-post testing environment to assess the comparative knowledge gained by these newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and to determine if this virtual dialogue model efficaciously delivers the knowledge of these multidisciplinary prostate cancer experts. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  An Internet-based virtual dialogue patient education model will make the most trustworthy health practitioners available to everyone for individual ""face-to-face"" dialogues about their area of expertise. Patients will be more knowledgeable about their illnesses because of the reliable, comprehensive information they obtain directly from the mouth of the expert. The researchers believe that virtual dialogue represents a new paradigm in patient education; one in which any patient can independently engage medical experts in one-on-one, face-to-face dialogues. The patient is the active participant in the dialogue, rather than a passive, compliant listener. The key technology objective of this Phase II project is to enhance the Virtual Conversations(R) patient education system to include the ability to distribute virtual dialogue programs over the Internet. Achieving this objective will open the door to quick and easy access to the proposed multidisciplinary, prostate cancer virtual dialogue series by all cancer institutions and prostate cancer patients with access to the Internet.           PROJECT NARRATIVE - RELEVANCE An Internet-based virtual dialogue patient education model will make the most trustworthy health practitioners available to everyone for individual ""face-to-face"" dialogues about their area of expertise.

"Detecting pre-cancerous lesions from high resolution prostate MRI    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       Successfully treating cancer that has metastasized is considerably more difficult than treating the cancer or precancerous state early in the process of carcinogenesis. Prostate cancer, if caught early, has a 100 percent, five-year survival rate - a surprisingly positive statistic compared to many other types of cancer. For this reason, early detection and localization of prostate cancer through screening is critical. Of late we have been developing computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tools for detecting malignant and pre-malignant lesions from high resolution Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging (MRI). Since pre-malignant lesions are widely believed to transform into carcinoma, such a system will help identify and monitor patients with a high risk of prostate cancer and initiate early targeted treatment for regression of the neoplastic process. The broad long term goal of this project is early detection of pre-malignant and malignant prostate lesions, which is extremely significant in (1) Monitoring patients with a high risk of developing prostatic adenocarcinoma, (2) Early targeted treatment for regression of pre-malignant and malignant lesions, and (3) Detection of new histological tissue classes which may be significant in understanding disease processes. The overarching goal of this work is early detection of pre-malignant and malignant lesions and possible identification of new histological tissue classes on high-resolution ex vivo MR imagery via CAD. The proposed work comprises a total of 3 specific aims and 9 tasks. Since it is known that pre-malignant lesions frequently coexist with prostate carcinoma, in this study we propose to only include patients who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer and have been scheduled for a prostatectomy. Under Aim 1 a total of 20 anonymised patient data sets comprising 3 Tesla (T) ex vivo MRI scans with accompanying whole mount histological sections after radical prostatectomy will be obtained. The inclusion of histological data will allow for precise determination of presence and extent of pre-malignant lesions via H&E staining and manual segmentation. Aim 1 will also involve determination of spatial extent of pre-malignant lesions (ground truth) ex vivo by registering the whole mount histological sections with the corresponding ex vivo MRI images. To detect presence and spatial extent of pre-malignant lesions we adopt a two pronged approach using a supervised and unsupervised classification technique. First, under Aim 2 we develop and evaluate a supervised CAD method for detecting pre-cancerous lesions by explicitly modeling textural attributes of HGPIN on ex vivo MRI studies. Under Aim 3 we begin with a supervised CAD model to distinguish cancerous from benign prostate lesions on ex vivo MRI and then apply an unsupervised non-linear dimensionality reduction method to detect new histological tissue classes as those that have characteristics which are intermediate between benign and malignant. Aim 3 will provide (i) a secondary method of detecting pre- cancerous lesions and thus useful in evaluating efficacy of the supervised CAD model developed in Aim 2 and (ii) aid in potential discovery of new histological classes which could facilitate our understanding of cancer progression. The efficacy of the methods proposed under Aims 2, 3 will be evaluated against ground truth derived from histology. This project will be a collaboration between investigators at Rutgers University and the University of Pennsylvania (UPENN). Aim 1 (Data Generation) will be carried out at UPENN while Aims 2 (Tumor ground truth generation) and 3 (CAD model) will be done at Rutgers.           n/a",Detecting pre-cancerous lesions from high resolution prostate MRI,7416827,R03CA128081,"['Adopted', 'Algorithms', 'Appearance', 'Benign', 'Cancer Cluster', 'Cancerous', 'Carcinoma', 'Categories', 'Characteristics', 'Class', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease regression', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Evaluation', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Histology', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Imagery', 'Lesion', 'Location', 'MRI Scans', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplastic Processes', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patients', 'Pennsylvania', 'Precancerous Conditions', 'Premalignant', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Adenocarcinoma', 'Prostate carcinoma', 'Prostatectomy', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Schedule', 'Screening procedure', 'Slice', 'Staining method', 'Stains', 'Survival Rate', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Work', 'base', 'cancer type', 'carcinogenesis', 'novel', 'statistics', 'three-dimensional modeling', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression']",NCI,"RUTGERS, THE STATE UNIV OF N.J.",R03,2008,77250,0.1562864545638407
"""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The availability of high-dimensional single-nucleotide (SNP) data for large samples of individuals with and without disease presents unprecedented opportunities for genetic epidemiologists, but also many statistical challenges.

The goals of this research are to develop new or improved methods for addressing these issues, and to apply them to data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will build on more than 15 years of previous work. Specifically, in 1988 the National Cancer Institute (NCI) awarded an Outstanding Investigator Grant (OIG) to the Principle Investigator for the development and application of new and improved statistical methods for use in epidemiological research. In 1995 this grant was renewed until NCI terminated the program in 2001. The research was then funded by R01 CA94069 for the period January 2002 to December 2006. This competing renewal application requests funds to continue this work and to apply it to new areas of emerging importance. The specific aims are fourfold: 1) to evaluate new and existing methods for controlling confounding and tail count variability in case-control genome-wide association (GWA) studies; 2) to evaluate risks associated with missense mutations of unknown significance in genes of established disease relevance; 3) to combine multiple independent sources of data in assessing the joint carcinogenic effects of groups of genes; and 4) to integrate data on tumor and patient characteristics for improved assessment of phenotype-specific etiology. We will evaluate the new methods by simulations, and we will illustrate them by application to existing data on cancers of the breast, ovary and prostate, and emerging data from GWA studies of breast and prostate cancer. The existing data have been collected either by the investigators and the consultants to this project, or as part of three collaborations in which the investigators participate: the Breast Cancer Family Registry (Breast-CFR), the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC), and the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG). In summary, we need sound, reliable methods for analyzing the vast amounts of emerging genetic data from individuals with and without a given type of cancer. The goals of this research are to develop such methods, and thereby to help generate new knowledge useful for cancer prevention and treatment.                                         n/a","""Statistical Methods for Genetic Epidemiology""",7316902,R01CA094069,"['Address', 'Admixture', 'Area', 'Award', 'BRCA1 gene', 'BRCA2 gene', 'Breast', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Characteristics', 'Collaborations', 'Count', 'Critiques', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Depth', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epidemiologist', 'Etiology', 'Family', 'Family-Based Registry', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glossary', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'International', 'Joints', 'Knowledge', 'Life Style', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of ovary', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methods', 'Missense Mutation', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'National Cancer Institute', 'Nucleotides', 'Odds Ratio', 'Output', 'Ovary', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Principal Investigator', 'Prostate', 'Rate', 'Registries', 'Request for Applications', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Sampling', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Site', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Stratification', 'Study Section', 'Suggestion', 'Tail', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'breast cancer family', 'cancer genetics', 'cancer prevention', 'cancer type', 'case control', 'computer program', 'conditioning', 'genetic epidemiology', 'genome wide association study', 'improved', 'innovation', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'post-doctoral training', 'programs', 'response', 'simulation', 'sound', 'tool', 'transmission process', 'tumor', 'user-friendly']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,556597,0.04679055529751026
"Development/Clinical Validation Markers for Prostate Ca    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have witnessed major improvements in our ability to detect and stage prostate cancer and have benefited from a sustained decrease in the death rate from this common disease due, in part, to the introduction of serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) into clinical practice in the late 1970's. Now in 2004, in the wake of the ""PSA era"" discoveries, we continue to perform diagnostic biopsies unnecessarily on 75% of men with abnormal PSA levels, finding 1:4 with disease, we continue to understage nearly 30% of men with presumed localized disease, and we continue to lack additional clinically validated prostate cancer biomarkers. Also, as the ""baby boomer"" men reach their 60's, it is anticipated that the number of men over age 50 will increase greatly, reaching 80 million by year 2015. This, coupled with the fact that there are nearly 20 million men in the U.S. alone who have had one negative prostate biopsy yet still are risk for prostate cancer and can no longer rely on PSA as their biomarker of choice. Clearly further discovery, characterization and validation of potential biomarkers for the early detection of prostate cancer are greatly needed - The mission of the Early Detection Research Network. In this competitive renewal proposal we will outline our progress between 1999 and 2004 as an EDRN Clinical and Epidemiological Center. We will demonstrate our ability to accrue patients, archive an impressive and clinically valuable biorepository of specimens, take part in collaborative research within the EDRN network, Industry and non-EDRN investigators, actively take part in the governance of the EDRN and publish key biomarker findings. Within this renewal we will also outline our proposed continuation/enhancements of our biorepository, anticipated development and participation in validation studies, characterization of novel tumor markers (pre-validation), preliminary pilot studies of biomarkers, evaluation of biomarker technologies and development of multivariate tumor marker models for complex evaluation of multiple tumor markers.            n/a",Development/Clinical Validation Markers for Prostate Ca,7031575,U01CA086323,"['artificial intelligence', 'biomarker', 'cancer registry /resource', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'cooperative study', 'human subject', 'immunocytochemistry', 'kallikreins', 'longitudinal human study', 'male', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'prognosis', 'prostate neoplasms', 'prostate specific antigen', 'tissue resource /registry']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2006,686983,0.2232180710575667

"CLINICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CENTER--PROSTATE CANCER Major strikes in the early detection, staging, monitoring, and risk stratification of men with prostate cancer have been realized over the last few decades. We have recently witnessed, for the first time, a reduction in the death rate for prostate cancer, stage migration with increased numbers of men with local/regional disease, and a greater understanding of the natural history of progression following recurrence. These advances, while not solely dependent on biomarkers, can be attributed to the discovery of Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) in the late 1970's. In 1999, in the wake of these discoveries, we still continue to unnecessarily biopsy 75% of men at risk for having prostate cancer to identify the 1:4 with the disease, continue to understage nearly 50% of men with presumed localized disease, continue to lack an accurate method for staging which can direct treatment decisions for the individual patient, and poorly understand the tumor biology and kinetics of disease progression. Clearly, discover of new tumor marker and validation/clinical investigation of the markers are mandatory to advance our knowledge and direct the care of men with prostate cancer. This proposal, for the development of a Clinical/Epidemiology Center, to evaluate the clinical, diagnostic and prognostic accuracy of new and existing biomarkers of prostate cancer draws strength from several unique features: a clinically important problem (see above), 2) a combined experience of over thirty years in clinical tumor marker investigation between the co-investigators, 3) collaborative efforts between our group and several commercial biomarker/reference laboratories with an interest in development and applications of biomarkers, 4) a unique resource of retrospective, prospective and longitudinal tissue and serum specimens from early detection programs, pre- and post-treatment tissue/serum banks and material from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, 5) a history of successful clinical evaluation of tumor markers by this group which have been FDA approved and are widely used in clinical practice (e.g. PSA, percent free-PSA), 6) a history of development of clinically useful algorithms and strategies for ""risk stratification"" for prostate cancer and 7) an abundance of short-term, long-term, developmental, feasibility, pilot and large-scale effort projects in progress, and proposed for future development of biomarkers for prostate cancer.  n/a",CLINICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL CENTER--PROSTATE CANCER,6724841,U01CA086323,"['artificial intelligence', 'biomarker', 'cancer registry /resource', 'clinical research', 'computer assisted diagnosis', 'cooperative study', 'human subject', 'immunocytochemistry', 'kallikreins', 'longitudinal human study', 'male', 'neoplasm /cancer classification /staging', 'neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', 'neoplasm /cancer epidemiology', 'prognosis', 'prostate neoplasms', 'prostate specific antigen', 'tissue resource /registry']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U01,2004,472484,0.25522382791968046
"A Multimedia Prostate Cancer Intelligent Expert System DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Patients diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer not only have to adjust to the psychosocial and physical consequences of their disease, but also must make sense of often complex and probabilistic information about their condition and treatment options. Yet, surprisingly, there are few structured and effective programs available to inform patients about their treatment options and to assist them in their treatment decision. We propose to develop and evaluate a computer-based multimedia intelligent expert system, designed to inform patients diagnosed with early stage prostate cancer about the disease, their treatment options, and about potential treatment consequences. The Prostate Intelligent Expert System (PIES) will present disease and treatment information that is targeted to the patient?s ethnicity and age, and tailored to his information seeking preference. The development of the program is guided by a cognitive-social approach to health information processing, which postulates that cognitive factors (i.e., expectations and beliefs about the disease and its treatment) and affective factors (i.e., cancer related worry) influence information processing and decision-making. From a technical point of view PIES is based on a successful multimedia intelligent expert instructional program to teach undergraduate courses in electrical engineering. The expert system goes beyond the common ""if. then"" statements used to tailor information to patients. Rather it continuously monitors the patient?s interaction with PIES, and thus is able to tailor information closely to the patients needs. PIES simulates a virtual health center. The patient can explore different virtual rooms (e.g., the library, the physician?s office, a support group, etc) to obtain information in an interactive way. Information will be presented through text, video, audio, and animation. The intelligent expert system will adjust the level of complexity of the information to meet the patient?s observed and stated information seeking preference. The feasibility and usability of PIES will be evaluated throughout the development period by the consulting physicians and by members of the target audience through focus groups and individual sessions during which patients explore earlier versions of the program. Formal usability and feasibility testing will be performed with early-stage prostate cancer patients (N=90) using a within-subject design. Assessments about prostate cancer knowledge and distress about treatment decision making will be obtained prior to and after completing PIES. Six weeks later patients? (N=81) treatment choice will be assessed. It is expected that PIES will result in an increase in disease and treatment knowledge, high satisfaction ratings with the information provided, and that PIES will facilitate treatment decision making. n/a",A Multimedia Prostate Cancer Intelligent Expert System,6621331,R21CA090904,"['artificial intelligence', ' clinical research', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' education evaluation /planning', ' human subject', ' neoplasm /cancer education', ' prostate neoplasms']",NCI,FOX CHASE CANCER CENTER,R21,2003,168000,0.1329761481269737
"Neural Network Prediction of Prostate Cancer Progression  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The broad, long-term objective of this application is to treat prostate cancer effectively through accurate diagnosis and accurate assessment of tumor progression. The hypothesis to be tested in this project is that artificial neural networks (ANNs) can accurately predict prostate cancer progression. The significance and health-relatedness of this research is that accurate prediction of prostate cancer progression is important to identify patients with organ-confined prostate cancer for whom surgery is highly effective, and patients with more advanced prostate cancer for whom surgery is less effective but imposes unnecessary risks of complications who are more appropriate to receive radiation, hormonal, and other therapies. Previous investigation of ANNs often rely on highly-selected ANNs that do not prove or disprove the effectiveness of ANNs. This application will determine, ultimately, whether ANN is more accurate than multivariate linear regression in the prediction of prostate cancer progression. Appropriate statistical models are important to combine clinically the results of an array of biomarkers and cancer predictors. The specific aims are:   (1) To develop an ANN-based method for the prediction of pathologic stage and to compare with the Partin nomogram - a clinically accepted multivariate linear regression-based method.  (2) To develop a novel method that will add 95% confidence intervals to the ANN prediction of prostate cancer progression.  (3) To develop an ANN-based model for the prediction of pathologic stage based on preoperative serial PSA measurements.  The research design is to develop ANN-based predictive models and compare them to a clinically accepted standard and previously published results that were considered promising but had produced limited clinical use.

"Bayesian Neural Networks For Prostate Cancer Study Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men over the age 50.  Staging serves as a road map for the treatment selection and helps in differentiating organ-confined cancers from the non-organ confined ones (those which have already spread to the outside of prostate-seminal vesicles, lymph nodes and bones).  Outcome of treatment varies significantly between these different kinds of cancers.  Only organ confined cancers are amenable to curative intent of surgery and radiation therapy. The main objective of this proposal is to explore the neural network technique for the prediction of certain features indicative on non-organ confined prostate cancer on the basis of the results of certain diagnostic tests administered to patients suffering from prostate cancer.  The approach is going to be Bayesian, and the goal is to provide the posterior (or predictive) probabilities of the presence of these features in the patients based on certain inputs.  The doctors can then make decisions on the basis of these probabilities, and in particular, in marginal cases (for example, when these posterior probabilities are in the neighborhood of 50 percent) go for further diagnostic tests rather than making an immediate decision of whether or not to suggest surgical intervention.  Within the Bayesian framework, several methods, both parametric and nonparametric, will be compared.  Also, the Bayesian procedures will be compared against some classical frequentist procedures. It may be added here that the Bayesian neural network methods to be proposed are versatile enough, and can be adapted for other nonlinear modeling.  n/a",Bayesian Neural Networks For Prostate Cancer Study,6654329,R01CA085414,"['artificial intelligence', ' cancer information system', ' clinical research', ' computer assisted diagnosis', ' diagnosis design /evaluation', ' human subject', ' lymph nodes', ' mathematical model', ' microtubule associated protein', ' model design /development', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis', ' outcomes research', ' prostate', ' prostate neoplasms', ' prostate specific antigen', ' racial /ethnic difference', ' seminal vesicles']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2003,155288,0.19328684545861372
"SEED LOCALIZER FOR IMAGE GUIDED PROSTATE BRACHYTHERAPY Permanent implantation of radioactive seeds is a viable and effective therapeutic option widely used today for early-stage prostate cancer. Compared to external radiation therapy in which radiation must penetrate healthy tissues in order to reach cancer cells, implantation of low-energy radionuclides permits highly localized delivery of radiation.  Although the implant procedure has improved in recent years with the help of computerized treatment planning and image guidance techniques, significant enhancement of clinical outcome is expected from implementation of real-time intraoperative dosimetry and optimization. Intraoperative evaluation of dose delivery would permit identification of underdosed regions and remedial seed placement, thus ensuring that the entire prostate volume receive the prescribed dose.  However, before the concept can be realized, the problem of real-time seed localization must be solved.  This is the focus of this investigation.  The specific aims of the project include development of (1) a fully automated method to segment seed images from the fluoroscopic data and (2) a fully automated method to identify individual seed positions including those that are superposed.  The image segmentation will be accomplished by a region based adaptive thresholding technique.  Subsequent localization of the seeds will be performed by a hierarchical decision process aided by an artificial intelligence controlled seed classifier.  n/a",SEED LOCALIZER FOR IMAGE GUIDED PROSTATE BRACHYTHERAPY,6498041,R21CA089061,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' fluoroscopy', ' neoplasm /cancer radionuclide therapy', ' phantom model', ' prostate neoplasms', ' radiation therapy dosage']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2002,148557,0.11659302801116544

"Bayesian Neural Networks For Prostate Cancer Study Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers among men over the age 50.

"SEED LOCALIZER FOR IMAGE GUIDED PROSTATE BRACHYTHERAPY Permanent implantation of radioactive seeds is a viable and effective therapeutic option widely used today for early-stage prostate cancer. Compared to external radiation therapy in which radiation must penetrate healthy tissues in order to reach cancer cells, implantation of low-energy radionuclides permits highly localized delivery of radiation.  Although the implant procedure has improved in recent years with the help of computerized treatment planning and image guidance techniques, significant enhancement of clinical outcome is expected from implementation of real-time intraoperative dosimetry and optimization. Intraoperative evaluation of dose delivery would permit identification of underdosed regions and remedial seed placement, thus ensuring that the entire prostate volume receive the prescribed dose.  However, before the concept can be realized, the problem of real-time seed localization must be solved.  This is the focus of this investigation.  The specific aims of the project include development of (1) a fully automated method to segment seed images from the fluoroscopic data and (2) a fully automated method to identify individual seed positions including those that are superposed.  The image segmentation will be accomplished by a region based adaptive thresholding technique.  Subsequent localization of the seeds will be performed by a hierarchical decision process aided by an artificial intelligence controlled seed classifier.  n/a",SEED LOCALIZER FOR IMAGE GUIDED PROSTATE BRACHYTHERAPY,6227506,R21CA089061,"['artificial intelligence', ' biomedical automation', ' computer assisted patient care', ' computer simulation', ' computer system design /evaluation', ' fluoroscopy', ' neoplasm /cancer radionuclide therapy', ' phantom model', ' prostate neoplasms', ' radiation therapy dosage']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R21,2001,146790,0.11659302801116544

"Image Analysis Tools for mpMRI Prostate Cancer Diagnosis Using PI-RADS Project Summary Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly occurring forms of cancer, accounting for 21% of all cancer in men. The Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) aims to standardize reporting of prostate cancer using multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). However, the in-depth analysis, as demanded by PI-RADS, remains challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of the disease, and it is a clinically burdensome task subject to both signiﬁcant intra- and inter-reader variability. Auxiliary tools based on machine learning methods such as deep learning can reduce diagnostic variability and increase workload efﬁciency by automatically performing tasks and presenting results to a radiologist for the purpose of decision support. In particular, automated identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of lesion candidates using imaging data can be performed with respect to PI-RADS scoring. In Phase I of this project, we developed two automated methods to reduce the intra- and inter-observer variability while interpreting mpMRI images using the PI-RADS protocol: (i) a method to co-register mpMRI data, and (ii) a method to geometrically segment the prostate gland into the PI-RADS protocol sector map. The overarching goal of this Phase II project is to develop machine learning algorithms that incorporate both co-registered multi-modal imaging biomarkers and PI-RADS sector map information into an automated clinical diagnostic aid. The innovation in this project lies in the use of deep learning to automatically predict PI-RADS classiﬁcation. This project is signiﬁcant in that it has the potential to improve clinical efﬁciency and reduce diagnostic variation in prostate cancer diagnosis. In Aim 1 of this project, we will develop a deep learning approach to localize and classify lesions in mpMRI. In Aim 2, we will integrate this diagnostic tool into the ProFuseCAD system and perform rigorous multi-site validation to quantify PI-RADS classiﬁcation performance. Both aims will utilize a database of over 1,000 existing mpMRI images from multiple clinical sites to develop and validate the algorithms. Ultimately, enhancements from this project will create a novel feature for Eigen's (the applicant company's) FDA 510(k)-cleared imaging product, ProFuseCAD, in order to improve the diagnosis and reporting of prostate cancer. Project Narrative Radiological interpretation of multimodal prostate imaging data is challenging and subject to high levels of vari- ability. To address this problem, auxiliary tools based on machine learning methods such as deep learning can increase workload efﬁciency by automatically performing tasks and presenting results to a radiologist for the purpose of decision support. In particular, automated identiﬁcation of lesion candidates and assessment of po- tentially benign or malignant lesions with respect to speciﬁc PI-RADS categories from clinical imaging data can improve prostate cancer reporting and reduce variation in radiological interpretation.",Image Analysis Tools for mpMRI Prostate Cancer Diagnosis Using PI-RADS,10155627,R42CA224888,"['Accounting', 'Address', 'Agreement', 'Algorithms', 'Atlases', 'Benign', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Diagnostics', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Categories', 'Cessation of life', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Computer Assisted', 'Consumption', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Databases', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Environment', 'Goals', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Information Systems', 'Interobserver Variability', 'Intraobserver Variability', 'Label', 'Lesion', 'Letters', 'Localized Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Maps', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Performance', 'Phase', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Psyche structure', 'Radiologic Finding', 'Radiology Specialty', 'Reader', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Site', 'Source', 'Specific qualifier value', 'Specificity', 'Staging', 'Standardization', 'System', 'T2 weighted imaging', 'Time', 'Training', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'Workload', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical diagnostics', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinical research site', 'commercialization', 'contrast enhanced', 'deep learning', 'design', 'disease heterogeneity', 'image guided', 'image registration', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'innovation', 'machine learning algorithm', 'machine learning method', 'medical specialties', 'men', 'mortality', 'multimodality', 'novel', 'prostate biopsy', 'radiological imaging', 'radiologist', 'research clinical testing', 'support tools', 'tool']",NCI,EIGEN HEALTH SERVICES LLC,R42,2020,700836,0.16330805760284597
"Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment Abstract: Fast, reliable and accurate delineation of pelvic organs in the planning and treatment images is a long- standing, important and technically challenging problem. Its solution is highly required for state-of-the-art image-guided radiation therapy planning and treatment, as better treatment decisions rely on timely interpretation of anatomical information in the images. However, automatic segmentation in male pelvic regions is always difficult due to 1) low contrast between prostate and surrounding organs, and 2) possibly disparate shapes/appearances of bladder and rectum caused by tissue deformations. The goal of this project is to create a set of novel machine learning tools to achieve accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (e.g., prostate, bladder, and rectum) in different modalities (e.g., planning CT, treatment CT/CBCT, and MRI) for radiotherapy of prostate cancer.  Planning CT. For automatic segmentation, landmark detection is often the first step in rapidly locating the target organs. Thus, in Aim 1, we will create a novel joint landmark detection approach, based on both random forests and auto-context model, to iteratively detect all landmarks and further coordinate their detection results for achieving more accurate and consistent landmark detection results. After roughly locating organs with the aid of those detected landmarks, the second step is to accurately segment boundaries of target organs in the planning CT. Accordingly, in Aim 2, we will create a set of learning methods to a) first simultaneously predict all pelvic organ boundaries in the planning CT with the regression forests trained by labeled training data, and b) then segment all pelvic organs jointly by deforming their respective shape models. In particular, to address the limitations of conventional deformable models in assuming simple Gaussian distributions for organ shapes, a novel hierarchical sparse shape composition approach will be developed to constrain shape models during deformable segmentation.  Treatment CT/CBCT. During the course of serial radiation treatments, to quantitatively record and monitor the accumulated dose delivered to the patient, organs in the treatment image also need to be segmented. Although methods proposed in Aims 1-2 can be simply applied, as done by many conventional methods, this will lead to a) inconsistent landmark detection and b) inconsistent segmentations across different treatment days because of possible large shape/appearance changes. Accordingly, in Aim 3, we will create a novel self- learning mechanism to gradually learn and incorporate patient-specific information into both joint landmark detection and deformable segmentation steps from the increasingly acquired treatment images of patient. Thus, population data will gradually be replaced by the patient's own data to train personalized models.  MRI. To guide pelvic organ segmentation in the planning CT, MRI is now often acquired for selected patients. To this end, in Aim 4, we will develop a) a prostate MRI segmentation method by using deep learning to learn MRI-specific features for guiding landmark detection and deformable segmentation as proposed in Aims 1-2; b) a novel collaborative MRI and CT segmentation algorithm for more accurate segmentation of planning CT.  All our developed algorithms will be evaluated for their performance in clinical (treatment planning and delivery) workflow for 130 patients in UNC Cancer Hospital and also hospitals of our consultants.  Benefit for Patient Care. Development of these segmentation tools will 1) dramatically accelerate the clinical workflow, 2) reduce workload (i.e., manual interaction time) for physicians, and 3) lead to better patient outcomes with reliable and accurate segmentations of target area and critical organs. Although these tools cannot replace the expertise of physicians, they can be of great assistance to physicians. Narrative Description of Project This project aims to create a set of novel machine learning tools for accurate, reliable and efficient delineation of important pelvic organs (such as prostate, bladder, and rectum) in various imaging modalities to help radiotherapy of prostate cancer. To achieve this goal, we will create 1) a novel joint landmark detection and boundary prediction framework for accurate segmentation of the planning CT images, 2) an innovative updating mechanism for incorporating patient-specific information from previous treatment images of same patient to progressively improve treatment CT/CBCT segmentation, and 3) a deep-learning based framework for learning MRI-specific features for prostate MRI segmentation, as well as a novel method for collaborative MRI & planning CT segmentation. We will validate these methods on real patients in our clinical workflow. Besides, although these machine-learning tools are designed for radiotherapy of prostate cancer, they can also be easily extended to other new organs and new modalities after appropriate updating and training.",Automatic Pelvic Organ Delineation in Prostate Cancer Treatment,10003010,R01CA206100,"['Address', 'Algorithms', 'Anatomy', 'Appearance', 'Area', 'Bladder', 'Cancer Hospital', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Treatment', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dose', 'General Population', 'Goals', 'Hospitals', 'Image', 'Joints', 'Label', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Multimodal Imaging', 'Normal Statistical Distribution', 'Organ', 'Patient Care', 'Patient Monitoring', 'Patient imaging', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pelvis', 'Performance', 'Physicians', 'Population', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radiation therapy', 'Rectum', 'Sample Size', 'Shapes', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Update', 'Workload', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'automated segmentation', 'base', 'deep learning', 'design', 'dosage', 'forest', 'image guided radiation therapy', 'imaging Segmentation', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'male', 'novel', 'prostate radiotherapy', 'random forest', 'segmentation algorithm', 'soft tissue', 'success', 'therapy design', 'tool', 'treatment duration', 'treatment planning']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,315338,0.10924608608343134
"SBIR Phase I Topic 402: Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring Current diagnostic approaches cannot determine which patients with early prostate cancer are most at risk for progression or recurrence, which leaves patients and physicians in the difficult position of choosing between active surveillance or aggressive therapy based on population risks associated with subjectively assigned Gleason scores. Stratifying patients into high-risk and low-risk groups at the time of initial biopsy or prostatectomy would provide critical information that providers and patients need to make decisions about prostate-sparing approaches or more aggressive treatment options that could improve patient outcomes. In this Phase I contract, Reveal Biosciences proposes to advance the development of imageDx: Prostate, an image-based, artificial-intelligence (AI)-enabled prognostic test designed to stratify patients with early stage prostate cancer according to their risk for disease progression or recurrence. Objectives include 1) selecting an imaging platform for test validation, 2) refining a user interface for the tool, 3) conducting a pilot study to demonstrate the feasibility of a risk prediction algorithm, 4) developing standard operating procedures for the tool, and 5) developing a regulatory strategy for test approval by the FDA. n/a","SBIR Phase I Topic 402: Artificial Intelligence-Aided Imaging for Cancer Prevention, Diagnosis, and Monitoring",10265917,5N91020C00051,"['Advanced Development', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Biological Sciences', 'Biopsy', 'Computer software', 'Contracts', 'Data', 'Data Sources', 'Decision Making', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease Progression', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Human', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical Imaging', 'Monitor', 'Pathologist', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physicians', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Prostatectomy', 'Provider', 'Recurrence', 'Risk', 'Small Business Innovation Research Grant', 'Testing', 'Time', 'TimeLine', 'Validation', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer prevention', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'high risk', 'imaging modality', 'imaging platform', 'imaging software', 'improved', 'patient stratification', 'prediction algorithm', 'prognostic assays', 'prototype', 'tool', 'usability']",NCI,"REVEAL BIOSCIENCES, INC.",N43,2020,392343,0.15697225520081137
"Content-based MR-TRUS Fusion without Tracking There are about 3 million American men living with prostate cancer, the second leading cause of cancer death for men in the United States. If the prostate cancer is caught early before it spreads to other parts of the body, by active monitoring or treatment, most men will not die from it. Nevertheless, 22% to 47% of the patients with negative biopsies but elevated prostate-specific antigen levels may still harbor malignant tumors, which can be life threatening and could have been missed by the commonly used ultrasound guided random biopsy. By contrast, fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted biopsies has shown to significantly improve the cancer detection rate. However, MR-TRUS fusion itself is very challenging due to the difficulties in directly registering images of these two very different modalities in different dimensions. To bypass the difficult registration problems, the existing fusion techniques require the use of specialized expensive and cumbersome hardware tracking devices, which increases cost and elongates procedures. More importantly, due to a number of factors such as patient movement, respiratory motion and ultrasound transducer pressure change, prostate motion can happen during a procedure and cause the images to be misaligned. Timely noticing and correcting such motion require great skill and knowledge of radiological imaging, where studies show a steep learning curve for mastering fusion systems. Failing in image registration and motion compensation renders the fusion guided biopsy performing no differently than random biopsy. To address the fundamental cause of the problems, the goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR- TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices. The proposed research is foundational for developing next generation of MR-TRUS fusion guidance systems for prostate biopsy to achieve robust performance with lower costs. Recent advancement in machine learning, especially deep learning, has provided us new tools and new angles to tackle this challenging problem. This project aims for directly fusing 2D TRUS frames with 3D MR volume by developing novel deep learning methods for image reconstruction and registration. The proposed methods are designed to exploit both population and patient specific imaging information to accurately align images. As all learning-based image registration methods try to better use population knowledge to improve the registration performance, few of them have been able to efficiently use patient specific information, which can be essential to obtain robust and accurate performance. Upon successful completion, the innovation created from the project will disrupt the common perception that hardware tracking has to be used for multimodal image fusion-guided interventions and alleviate the demand on physicians’ experience and skill in image analysis and fusion to help obtain consistent results. This project will lead to the development of novel prostate biopsy systems and will also impact a range of other image fusion based interventional guidance technologies. Fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted prostate biopsies can significantly improve the detection of aggressive cancer.

Nevertheless, 22% to 47% of the patients with negative biopsies but elevated prostate-specific antigen levels may still harbor malignant tumors, which can be life threatening and could have been missed by the commonly used ultrasound guided random biopsy. By contrast, fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted biopsies has shown to significantly improve the cancer detection rate. However, MR-TRUS fusion itself is very challenging due to the difficulties in directly registering images of these two very different modalities in different dimensions. To bypass the difficult registration problems, the existing fusion techniques require the use of specialized expensive and cumbersome hardware tracking devices, which increases cost and elongates procedures. More importantly, due to a number of factors such as patient movement, respiratory motion and ultrasound transducer pressure change, prostate motion can happen during a procedure and cause the images to be misaligned. Timely noticing and correcting such motion require great skill and knowledge of radiological imaging, where studies show a steep learning curve for mastering fusion systems. Failing in image registration and motion compensation renders the fusion guided biopsy performing no differently than random biopsy. To address the fundamental cause of the problems, the goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR- TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices. The proposed research is foundational for developing next generation of MR-TRUS fusion guidance systems for prostate biopsy to achieve robust performance with lower costs. Recent advancement in machine learning, especially deep learning, has provided us new tools and new angles to tackle this challenging problem. This project aims for directly fusing 2D TRUS frames with 3D MR volume by developing novel deep learning methods for image reconstruction and registration. The proposed methods are designed to exploit both population and patient specific imaging information to accurately align images. As all learning-based image registration methods try to better use population knowledge to improve the registration performance, few of them have been able to efficiently use patient specific information, which can be essential to obtain robust and accurate performance. Upon successful completion, the innovation created from the project will disrupt the common perception that hardware tracking has to be used for multimodal image fusion-guided interventions and alleviate the demand on physicians’ experience and skill in image analysis and fusion to help obtain consistent results. This project will lead to the development of novel prostate biopsy systems and will also impact a range of other image fusion based interventional guidance technologies. Fusion of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) for guiding targeted prostate biopsies can significantly improve the detection of aggressive cancer. The goal of this project is to create enabling technology of MR-TRUS image fusion solely based on internal image content without using external tracking devices.

"Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT Multiple randomized clinical trials have shown that delivery of higher radiation doses to the prostate results in improved tumor control rates in prostate cancer radiation therapy (RT). As local recurrence mostly occurs at the primary tumor, particularly for high-risk patients, additional dose escalation is expected to improve the treatment outcome. However, the application of dose escalation for prostate RT is greatly limited by the tolerance of nearby healthy tissues that cannot adequately be excluded from the radiation field. This limitation can be overcome by dose painting, where a higher dose is applied to the prostate tumor only instead of the whole prostate gland. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) offers reduced treatment time, convenience, and possibly increased treatment efficacy as compared to the conventionally fraction scheme. UTSW is currently conducting a dose escalation trial using SBRT for high-risk prostate cancer patients with an integrated dose boost on MRI-visualized prostate tumor. However, prostate can move and deform during the beam delivery. To ensure the escalated dose is actually delivered to tumor regions as planned, a reliable tumor tracking method is urgently needed. While intra-prostatic tumors can be identified by multi-parametric MRI (mpMRI) for treatment planning, intrafraction tumor tracking during the beam delivery is not achievable with mpMRI. In contrast, ultrasound offers a cost-effective and real-time imaging with high soft tissue contrast. However, conventional ultrasound techniques only provide anatomic structure of the prostate gland without the capability to differentiate tumor region from the rest of the prostate gland. Temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) has emerged as a new paradigm for prostate tissue characterization by analyzing the time-series ultrasound images with advanced machine learning techniques. In this project, we aim to develop, optimize and evaluate an innovative TeUS based intra-prostatic tumor tracking method to guide SBRT with an integrated dose boost for high-risk prostate cancer patients. The specific aims are: 1) Develop TeUS-based intra-prostatic tumor delineation for guiding focused dose escalation; 2) Integrate and validate TeUS-based tumor tracking system during SBRT; and 3) Evaluate clinical gain of TeUS guided SBRT for high risk prostate cancer patients. Successful completion of the proposed project will lead to the development and validation of a low-cost yet highly accurate TeUS guided system for targeted prostate cancer RT. With enhanced real-time visualization of tumor, the use of TeUS for RT guidance will lead to better treatment efficacy and reduced toxicity. Delivery of higher radiation doses to the tumor region can improve outcome of radiation therapy for high-risk prostate cancer patients. As the prostate can move and deform during radiation beam delivery, there is an urgent need for a reliable method to ensure escalated dose is delivered to the tumor region as planned. We will develop, integrate and evaluate a novel prostate tumor tracking method based on temporal enhanced ultrasound (TeUS) to guide radiation therapy for high-risk patients, which will lead to higher local control with improved toxicity.",Real-time prostate lesion tracking during SBRT,9915917,R01EB027898,"['Aftercare', 'Anatomy', 'Area Under Curve', 'Benign', 'Biochemical', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Blood Vessels', 'Cancer Patient', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Consumption', 'Development', 'Diagnostic', 'Dose', 'Dose-Limiting', 'Enrollment', 'Ensure', 'External Beam Radiation Therapy', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Knowledge', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Modality', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Motion', 'Organ', 'Patients', 'Phase', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Primary Neoplasm', 'Probability', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Prostatic', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radiation', 'Radiation Dose Unit', 'Radiation therapy', 'Randomized Clinical Trials', 'Rectum', 'Recurrence', 'Rest', 'Scheme', 'Series', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Therapy trial', 'Time', 'Time Series Analysis', 'Tissues', 'Toxic effect', 'Treatment Efficacy', 'Treatment outcome', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urethra', 'Validation', 'Visualization', 'advanced prostate cancer', 'base', 'cancer radiation therapy', 'cohort', 'cost', 'cost effective', 'deep learning', 'early phase trial', 'high risk', 'improved', 'improved outcome', 'innovation', 'novel', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate cancer risk', 'prostate lesions', 'real-time images', 'soft tissue', 'standard care', 'treatment planning', 'tumor', 'vibration']",NIBIB,UT SOUTHWESTERN MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,351181,0.16301538725589795
"Pathomic Predictors of Prostate Cancer Progression Abstract  Recent studies suggest that in the U.S. prostate cancer is over-detected and over-treated resulting in significant morbidity and financial costs. These problems are the product of poor sensitivity and specificity serum Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) as a screening tool, leading to unnecessary biopsies that find small and predominantly indolent prostate tumors. While many prostate cancers should be managed with active surveillance, uncertainties surrounding available clinical tools of aggressiveness (such as PSA, Gleason score and clinical stage) will often drive patients and physicians to treatment. Attempts to improve prognostication using candidate biomarkers, mostly discovered from genomic analyses of large pieces of cancers, have had few successes, and available molecular tools provide only modest prediction, at best. An alternative to the genomic driver focus is that a combination of molecular events, under the influence of the tumor microenvironment, drive tumor’s molecular evolution and progression. Consequently, analysis of tumor characteristics detectable in pathomic data, such as heterogeneity of expression subtypes, amount of stroma, extent of microenvironmental heterogeneity, extent of immune infiltration, or extent of hypoxia, may ultimately lead to better patient stratification. Our proposal fundamentally centers around the most critical clinical question in early prostate cancer that is the basis for clinical decision making: Can we identify proteomic, imaging, and/or microenvironment features that distinguish those aggressive cancers that will progress to cause harm from benign cancers that can be safely monitored by watchful waiting?  To examine the links between the heterogeneity of early, screen-detected prostate cancers and likelihood of progression, we will interrogate a retrospective set of 225 prostatectomy patients. In Aim 1, we will use GE’s hyperplexed immune-pathology platform (Cell DIVE) to profile over 50 proteins at the cellular and subcellular level along with matrix components that define the microenvironments with the cells present in this matrix. In Aim 2, we will focus on single-cell level data and systematically extract the prevalence of the diverse cell subtypes found within these tumors. Cells will be typed along traditional axes (e.g. epithelial, CD4+ T-cells). In addition, we will use molecular and structural characteristics to define novel subtypes. Features associated with cell types (e.g. existence, prevalence, diversity) will be used alone and in combination with Gleason grading to distinguish patients with aggressive tumors that are likely to progress. Aim 3 will focus on neighborhood and regional analyses, particularly on developing approaches to extract tumor microenvironmental characteristics that have demonstrated linkages to progression (hypoxia, stromal reactivity, immune cell patterning). Using a diverse set of these features, alongside deep learning techniques on primary images, we will develop classifiers distinguishing aggressive and benign tumors. Finally, in Aim 4 we will validate classifiers in large cohorts. Project Narrative  Our proposal fundamentally centers around the most critical clinical question in early prostate cancer that is the basis for clinical decision making; namely, can we identify proteomic, imaging, and/or microenvironment features that distinguish those aggressive cancers that will progress to cause harm from benign cancers that can be safely monitored by watchful waiting?",Pathomic Predictors of Prostate Cancer Progression,9976347,R01CA249899,"['Apoptosis', 'Benign', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'CD4 Positive T Lymphocytes', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Cancer Patient', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Epithelial', 'Epithelium', 'Event', 'Financial cost', 'Formalin', 'Genomics', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Heterogeneity', 'Histologic', 'Hypoxia', 'Image', 'Imaging Device', 'Immune', 'Immune response', 'Immunofluorescence Immunologic', 'In Situ', 'Indolent', 'Infiltration', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Epithelial Cell', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Molecular Structure', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Morphology', 'Neighborhoods', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'PI3K/AKT', 'PSA screening', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patient observation', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Physicians', 'Prevalence', 'Process', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Proteins', 'Proteomics', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Pathway', 'Stains', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Texture', 'Tissue Microarray', 'Tumor-infiltrating immune cells', 'Uncertainty', 'adverse outcome', 'angiogenesis', 'base', 'cancer care', 'candidate marker', 'cell type', 'clinical decision-making', 'cohort', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'density', 'early screening', 'ethnic diversity', 'follow-up', 'improved', 'malignant breast neoplasm', 'men', 'molecular pathology', 'molecular phenotype', 'molecular subtypes', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'prognostic', 'prostate cancer progression', 'serum PSA', 'success', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor hypoxia', 'tumor metabolism', 'tumor microenvironment', 'tumor progression']",NCI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,910446,0.11395595271605172
"Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam Abstract Non-invasive, multi-parametric characterization of prostate cancer (PC), with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods, is an active area of research with great potential for providing improved diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The PI-RADSv2 assessment system that was established by an international team of experts recognizes the value of quantitative images in PC diagnosis, but relies largely on qualitative evaluation of weighted images. Although this grading approach achieves reasonably good separation be- tween normal and abnormal prostate tissue, it does not achieve adequate separation between indolent and aggressive disease, with the risk that more unnecessary and costly surgery is performed with poten- tially dire consequences on patient quality of life. High-value protocols, without need for an invasive and costly endo-rectal radio-frequency coil are being investigated. This comes at the cost of extended scan time and reduced image quality in terms of spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio and signal bias, which negatively impacts sensitivity and speciﬁcity of multi-parametric MRI. With the pronounced increase of multi-parametric MRI exams, there is also the desire to integrate the support by the most recent revolution in diagnostic imaging, i.e., machine learning. It becomes increasingly clear, that in order to avoid having to train neural networks for each speciﬁc system and protocol, reproducible and thus preferably quantitative imaging protocols are essential. To overcome these limitations, we propose both pulse sequence develop- ment, investigation of ADC validity and reproducibility and novel post-processing strategies. The overall objective is to demonstrate the added value of lesion characterization with quantitative values and at the same time understand and minimize the inﬂuence of protocol choices and scan hardware, hence improve overall reproducibility. Speciﬁc Aim 1 will focus on the development of a low distortion MR imaging sequence for rapid concurrent quantiﬁcation of T2 and diﬀusion signal decay. Speciﬁc Aim 2 will examine ADC variations that result from changes in diﬀusion time over a range that is typical with present day clinical MR systems. Speciﬁc Aim 3 introduces advanced handling of low noise diﬀusion data, which will be indispensable for achieving high accuracy and precision with non-invasive and economic external coils. Speciﬁc Aim 4 introduces a novel ADC computation approach that fully captures the complex diﬀusion signal decays in tissues and at the same time is largely protocol and system independent. Moreover, re- sulting images and quantitative maps processed according this approach, exhibit considerably lower noise, which can be traded for higher spatial resolution or shorter scan duration. In combination, the consis- tently quantitative nature of the data and its ubiquitous validity and comparability will greatly facilitate the establishment of recommendations for disease-related thresholds. Ultimately this may permit much more reliable diﬀerentiation of aggressive from indolent disease. Project Narrative Magnetic resonance imaging plays an important role for staging of prostate cancer. We propose advances that permit quantitative and a more reliable assessment of prostate cancer. Potentially this will permit better diﬀerentiation of disease that is aggressive from disease that poses low risk of spreading.",Development of Methods for a Simplified and Reliable Prostate Cancer MRI Exam,9973564,R01CA241817,"['Architecture', 'Area', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Consequentialism', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Diffusion', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Enrollment', 'Exhibits', 'Fingerprint', 'Image', 'Indolent', 'International', 'Investigation', 'Joints', 'Lesion', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Maps', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Microscopic', 'Monitor', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Play', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Protocols documentation', 'Qualitative Evaluations', 'Quality of life', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Recommendation', 'Relaxation', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Signal Transduction', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translating', 'Tweens', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'cancer diagnosis', 'contrast imaging', 'cost', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'magnetic field', 'method development', 'neural network', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'quantitative imaging', 'radio frequency', 'rectal']",NCI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,454234,0.0930957665446167
"Urinary biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis and risk assessment PROJECT ABSTRACT This project aims to develop a urine-based screening tool for prostate cancer that could affect at least 13 million men in the US who receive prostate cancer screening every year. Today, serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) remains the most commonly used screening test for prostate cancer (PCa), but the lack of specificity of PSA has led to unnecessary prostate biopsies. In addition, PCa is a heterogeneous disease ranging from indolent to life threatening or clinically significant. About 20% to 50% of men who get a positive biopsy have PCa that never grows, spreads, or harms them. Thus, there is a great need to develop better alternatives that can reliably diagnose PCa and also identify men with clinically significant prostate cancer who are most likely to benefit from early diagnosis while avoiding the over-diagnosis and overtreatment of indolent cancer. Research has found that trained dogs can distinguish patients with and without PCa by sniffing their urine. In turn, we can use these odor-producing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as biomarkers for PCa diagnosis and risk assessment. Our preliminary data have shown that VOCs in urine are significantly different (p<0.05) between prostate cancer patients and healthy subjects. We hypothesize that pathological processes of PCa can alter the production of specific VOCs that are different and distinguishable from the VOC profile of healthy individuals. We also hypothesize that certain PCa specific VOCs are conserved across different ethnic groups, and that these VOCs are highly significant for diagnosing PCa. In this proposed study, we aim to (1) develop a urinary VOC-based screening model for PCa diagnosis; (2) create a prostate cancer risk model based on urinary VOCs for differentiating indolent from clinically significant PCa, and (3) evaluate longitudinal patterns of change of urinary VOC profiles in men with and without prostate disease. The expected outcomes and impacts of the project is to develop a non-invasive urinary VOC based model that can detect PCa with over 90 % accuracy, thus providing a better alternative to the current PSA test for PCa diagnosis. Furthermore, the VOC risk model could become a revolutionary tool with high specificity for clinically significant PCa; it has the benefit of early diagnosis while preventing over-diagnosis (i.e. finding indolent PCa that will never develop into advanced deleterious PCa) and overtreatment of indolent PCa (i.e. getting unnecessary and aggressive treatment). It would directly benefit over 13 million men receiving PSA testing in the US annually, and prevent at least 2 million unnecessary biopsies and their inherent risks (pain, bleeding, infection, death), and will reduce cost (time away from work, cost of procedure and ancillary studies) and anxiety. PROJECT NARRATIVES This research is to use the organic metabolites in urine as biomarkers to diagnose prostate cancer (PCa). We expect to develop a non-invasive urinary VOC based screening model that can detect PCa with over 90 % accuracy, thus providing a better alternative to the current PSA test for PCa diagnosis. We will also develop a VOC risk model could become a revolutionary tool with high specificity for clinically significant PCa to provide the benefit of early diagnosis while preventing over-diagnosis (i.e. finding indolent PCa that will never develop into advanced deleterious PCa) and overtreatment (i.e. getting unnecessary and aggressive treatment) of indolent PCa.",Urinary biomarkers for prostate cancer diagnosis and risk assessment,10020926,SC1CA245675,"['Affect', 'African American', 'Aftercare', 'Ancillary Study', 'Anxiety', 'Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Cancer Patient', 'Canis familiaris', 'Caucasians', 'Cessation of life', 'Clinical', 'Data', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Effectiveness', 'Ethnic group', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Future', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hispanics', 'Histologic', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Infection', 'Life', 'Linear Regressions', 'Logistic Regressions', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Modeling', 'Monitor', 'Odors', 'Outcome', 'PSA screening', 'Pain', 'Pathologic Processes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Production', 'Prognostic Marker', 'Prostate', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen', 'Prostatic Diseases', 'Research', 'Research Design', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Screening procedure', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Specificity', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Urine', 'Use Effectiveness', 'Work', 'aggressive therapy', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer risk', 'clinically significant', 'cohort', 'cost', 'disorder control', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'men', 'multidisciplinary', 'overtreatment', 'predictive marker', 'prevent', 'primary endpoint', 'procedure cost', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate cancer model', 'prostate cancer progression', 'prostate cancer risk', 'random forest', 'screening', 'serum PSA', 'tool', 'unnecessary treatment', 'urinary', 'volatile organic compound']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,SC1,2020,377500,0.21772417152481732

"Prostate Cancer Imaging Prostate cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in males. As a result of screening with serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) there has been a dramatic increase in the number of men diagnosed with prostate cancer, about 180,000 new diagnoses annually. The diagnosis is being made at a younger age yet the morbidity of the standard treatment such as surgery and radiation---remain unchanged. Thus, men with the diagnosis of prostate cancer are often overtreated for their disease and will live with the consequences of this treatment for many years, greatly affecting the Quality of Life Years (QALY). The ultimate answer to this dilemma is serum biomarkers that identify lethal cancers but not incidental cancers but this is unlikely to occur soon. In the meantime, methods of localizing prostate cancer and treating them with minimally invasive therapy would dramatically lessen the morbidity associated with widespread screening and the overdiagnosis/overtreatment of prostate cancer. A variety of imaging methods have been developed and we are exploring their role in localizing early prostate cancer. The MIP has partnered with the Urologic Oncology Branch to develop new imaging methods to be coupled with minimally invasive treatment methods which include RF/laser ablation, targeted radiation and photoimmunotherapy. The MIP is engaged in a number of pre-clinical studies in prostate cancer. We have been investigating a variety of targeted imaging agents. Initially, we have evaluated several antibodies and antibody fragments against PSMA (3TC, J591) in animal models of prostate cancer. Recently we began using PSMA PET based on small molecules that target PSMA. Metabolic studies of prostate cancer may have implications for therapy. We are investigating PET in animal models of prostate cancer to detect differences in metabolism between the androgen-sensitive and insensitive state. Moreover, we are launching a program in C13 hyperpolarization of pyruvate which will enable non invasive monitoring of metabolism Clinical Trials The MIP has been studying prostate cancer imaging in humans since its inception. We have developed analytic tools in conjunction with a CRADA with Philips Medical Systems. We have demonstrated that a multiparametric approach improves the specificity of 3T MRI for prostate cancer. However, there remain significant limitations in the sensitivity and specificity of 3T MRI. After patients undergo prostatectomy and their specimens are available for review it is clear that less than 40% would be amenable for focal therapy based on being single, well circumscribed lesions that are visible on MRI. We have designed a customized prostate mold which is in use in all patients undergoing surgery at NCI. It enables the imaging to be directly correlated with the pathologic specimen. Therefore, working with Philips Medical Systems we have designed an US-MR fusion system that takes the data from the 3T MRI and fuses it to the real time ultrasound image. This product was released for sale in 2013 under the name UroNav. Biopsy and interventional procedures can then be performed under MR guidance using the ultrasound. This device has been used successfully in over 2000 patients at NCI. A dog study showed the accuracy was about 3-4mm but was much better than cognitive biopsies. We are currently using a similar platform to direct focal laser ablation (FLA) of suitable prostate lesions (i.e. ones that are well demarcated, low Gleason score and could otherwise be watched. We are also testing HIFU in animal models. Computer aided diagnosis and machine learning are new areas of research for the MIP. Significant progress has been made in designing new AI algorithms to help radiologists identify cancers and characterize them. We have extended these AI algorithms to encompass pathologic analysis of biopsy specimens in the hopes of better predicting high risk patients. We are developing novel PET agents that might be more specific for prostate cancer, especially in detecting metastases. For instance, we completed a PET study using 11C-Acetate and 18F-ACBC, an agent associated with amino acid transport which has shown success in localizing recurrent prostate cancer. Ultimately we wish to combine PET-MR studies and conduct minimally invasive therapies after US fusion. We completed a trial of the agent, F18-DCFBC which is a first generation low molecular weight tracer directed at PSMA. We are performing PET studies with a PSMA targeted PET agent. We are conducting trials using F18 DCFPyl, a second generation agent directed at PSMA. This agent has already shown great potential to characterize the disease status even when post treatment PSA levels are quite low. We are also generating computer aided diagnosis (CAD) devices and algorithms that could automate the diagnosis of prostate cancer. As part of a FLEX grant we have tested numerous other PET agents including F-DHT, arachidonic acid, CXCR4, FDG and F Glutamine and F Bombesin in order to select better agents for imaging prostate cancer. Moreover, since PSMA is so important we have begun basic research to evaluate the expression of PSMA and what controls it. For instance, we found PSMA is one a small group of genes that is regulated by numerous co-factors. n/a",Prostate Cancer Imaging,10262122,ZIABC010655,"['Ablation', 'Acetates', 'Affect', 'Aftercare', 'Age', 'Algorithms', 'American', 'Amino Acids', 'Animal Model', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Arachidonic Acids', 'Area', 'Basic Science', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Biopsy Specimen', 'Bombesin', 'CXCR4 gene', 'Cancer Etiology', 'Canis familiaris', 'Cessation of life', 'Circumscribed Lesion', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Cognitive', 'Computer-Assisted Diagnosis', 'Cooperative Research and Development Agreement', 'Coupled', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Devices', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Focused Ultrasound Therapy', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genomics', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Glutamine', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Guided Biopsy', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments', 'Intervention', 'J591 Monoclonal Antibody', 'Lamivudine', 'Lasers', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Medical', 'Metabolism', 'Metastatic Neoplasm to the Bone', 'Methods', 'Molds', 'Molecular Weight', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Names', 'Natural History', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'PSA level', 'Pathologic', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Physicians', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Procedures', 'Prostate', 'Prostatectomy', 'Pyruvate', 'Quality of life', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'Radiation', 'Recurrence', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Sales', 'Screening Result', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Serum', 'Skin Cancer', 'Sodium Fluoride', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Staging', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tracer', 'Treatment Side Effects', 'Ultrasonography', 'Urologic Oncology', 'analytical tool', 'androgen sensitive', 'base', 'blind', 'bone imaging', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer recurrence', 'castration resistant prostate cancer', 'computer generated', 'design', 'high risk', 'imaging agent', 'imaging modality', 'improved', 'male', 'men', 'metabolic abnormality assessment', 'minimally invasive', 'non-invasive monitor', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'photoimmunotherapy', 'preclinical study', 'prognostic', 'programs', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate cancer model', 'prostate lesions', 'radiologist', 'screening', 'serum PSA', 'small molecule', 'standard care', 'standard of care', 'success', 'targeted agent', 'targeted imaging', 'tumor']",NCI,DIVISION OF BASIC SCIENCES - NCI,ZIA,2020,3640096,0.26856897466789925
"High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy Project Summary: In prostate cancer (PCa), the presence and amount of residual tumor at the surface of the excised prostate is the only prognostic factor that is affected by surgical technique, vs. other factors, which are fixed and non-modifiable. Yet, positive surgical margins (PSM), defined as the presence of tumor cells at the inked surface of the removed specimen, are common, especially in advanced stage cancers, and are a strong independent risk factor for clinical progression and secondary treatment. In addition, elevated post-operative PSA, which is understood to be related to tumor left behind in the patient, is also associated with high risk of progression and secondary treatment. Thus, complete tumor removal is important to achieve to improve  patient outcomes and reduce overtreatment, yet there is a delicate balance between resection radicality and  minimizing damage to the neurovascular bundles to preserve post-operative function. The NeuroSAFE trial demonstrated that real-time detection and correction of PSMs by comprehensive histology of the prostate  circumference results in improved patient outcomes, yet there are no widely adoptable methods to achieve this. In an effort to address this technical gap, we have developed video-rate structured illumination microscopy (VR-SIM) and demonstrated that it enables accurate diagnosis of PCa in the biopsy setting, and that it can  rapidly deliver gigapixel microscopic images of the entire prostate surface for detection of PSMs. VR-SIM delivers the surface area coverage and resolution needed to detect PSMs, yet it is also fast and relatively simple and inexpensive, opening the possibility for widespread adoption. In this project, our interdisciplinary team of  engineers and clinicians with significant prostate expertise will further advance this technology towards clinical translation, by completing critical technology development steps and by prospectively validating it in a large patient series. Specifically, we will increase the mechanical automation speed of the device, and will develop a fully automated system for handling of the removed prostate, to enable gigapixel panoramas of the entire  prostate circumferential surface to be delivered within 10 minutes of removal and with minimal tissue processing and user intervention. We will then leverage our recently developed dual-color fluorescent stain that replicates standard H&E with high specificity, to develop expert-validated clinical image atlases using biopsies and  cadaveric specimens to enhance image interpretation of VR-SIM prostate panoramas. These improvements will be combined to test the system in a prospective 250-patient clinical study, to determine the accuracy of the device for intra-operative detection of PSMs and prediction of post-operative PSA based on measurement of PSM extent. Finally, we will measure and model expert reviewer behavior using a novel web-enabled visual observer tracking method, which could be used in future computer-assisted search algorithms to expedite  intra-operative image review. Successful completion will set the stage for multi-center clinical trials to validate the clinical utility of VR-SIM for real-time detection and correction of PSMs, and improvement of patient outcomes. Project Narrative: Achieving complete tumor removal in prostate cancer is an important goal to achieve because leaving tumor behind in the patient contributes to increased risk of cancer progression and need for additional harmful treatment. Yet, it is difficult to determine in real-time if surgery is successful due to the lack of available technologies for intra-operative guidance. This project will develop a rapid scanner that will automatically scan the entire prostate surface for residual tumor within 10 minutes of removal, providing images which are readily interpreted by trained pathologists and enabling real-time guidance of nerve-sparing prostate cancer surgery.",High speed automated intraoperative microscopy of the prostate circumference to ensure tumor-free margins in radical prostatectomy,9932350,R01CA222831,"['Address', 'Adopted', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Atlases', 'Automation', 'Behavior', 'Biopsy', 'Cadaver', 'Case Series', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Management', 'Clinical Research', 'Color', 'Computer Assisted', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Devices', 'Diagnostic', 'Engineering', 'Ensure', 'Equilibrium', 'Excision', 'Frozen Sections', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genitourinary system', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Histology', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Image Enhancement', 'Image-Guided Surgery', 'Ink', 'Intervention', 'Left', 'Lighting', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Manuals', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mechanics', 'Methods', 'Microscopy', 'Modeling', 'Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial', 'Nerve', 'Online Systems', 'Operating Rooms', 'Operative Surgical Procedures', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Pathologist', 'Pathology', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Postoperative Period', 'Prognostic Factor', 'Progression-Free Survivals', 'Prostate', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Radical Prostatectomy', 'Residual Tumors', 'Resolution', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Scanning', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Series', 'Site', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'Speed', 'Stains', 'Structure', 'Surface', 'Surface of the Prostate', 'Surgical margins', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Validation', 'Visual', 'Work', 'accurate diagnosis', 'analog', 'authority', 'base', 'cancer diagnosis', 'cancer imaging', 'cancer risk', 'cancer surgery', 'classification algorithm', 'clinical imaging', 'clinical practice', 'clinical translation', 'cohort', 'computer aided detection', 'contrast imaging', 'high risk', 'histological image', 'imaging system', 'improved', 'machine learning algorithm', 'men', 'microscopic imaging', 'neoplastic cell', 'neurovascular', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'preservation', 'prospective', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate surgery', 'rapid detection', 'recruit', 'technology development', 'tissue processing', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor progression', 'visual search', 'web-enabled']",NCI,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2020,355935,0.1944543663361857
"MRI Imaging and Biomarkers for Early Detection of Aggressive Prostate Cancer Abstract  Oversampling and overdiagnosis of prostate cancer are significant management and cost issues that burden our health care system and the individual at risk with unnecessary biopsies and potential complications. The proposed studies will validate recent advances in quantitative prostate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) techniques, blood biomarkers of aggressive prostate cancer and radiogenomics that relate to increased aggressive cancer risk by our group and collaborators. The overarching goal is to increase the negative predictive value (NPV) for significant prostate cancer and consequently reduce unnecessary biopsies. Central to the proposal are key collaborations between investigators from the Consortium for Imaging and Biomarkers (CIB), Early Detection Research Network (EDRN), and Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPL).  Novel automated techniques for quantitative analysis of mpMRI that identify prostate habitats at risk of harboring significant prostate cancer (Gleason score 3+4 and above or Grade Group (GG)2+) will be combined with improvements in mpMRI-ultrasound fusion biopsies. Our automated pixel-by-pixel 3D prostate habitat risk scoring (HRS) system is superior to the standard prostate lesion classification system, PIRADSv2, and is hypothesized to improve the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) for significant GG2+ cancers (Aim 1). Radiomics will be applied in Aim 1 to refine HRS in the University of Miami MDSelect protocol of 250 men (discovery=150; validation=100).  Just as PIRADSv2 is suboptimal because it does not incorporate quantitative imaging information in risk stratification, models of risk based only on histopathologic grading ignore the underlying genomic determinants of outcome. We have shown that radiomics features are associated with underlying gene expression markers of adverse outcome. We propose in Aim 2 to apply newer criteria that incorporate Decipher® score with clinical-pathologic factors to improve the identification of aggressive prostate cancer. Radiomic features associated with these published criteria, termed the Spratt criteria, will improve the NPV for nonaggressive prostate cancer in the MDSelect cohort.  We will also collaborate with investigators involved in the EDRN ID-430 clinical trial to test our models in a cohort (n=200) in a less rigorously controlled multi-institutional group with more variability in imaging techniques, vendors and machines.  There is also opportunity to further improve risk classification through the analysis of blood-based markers (Aim 3) such as 4Kscore, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating cancer associated macrophage like (CAML) cells that are early biomarkers of aggressive cancer. The proposed work will test the incremental benefit of adding these serum-based biomarkers to improve the NPV models for significant prostate cancer. Narrative  Oversampling and over-diagnosis of prostate cancer are significant management and cost issues that burden our health care system and the individual at risk with unnecessary biopsies and potential complications. The proposed work will combine quantitative imaging features, informed by tumor grade and gene expression, with blood based biomarkers into an objective, automated, tool optimized to achieve a high negative predictive value for significant cancer in undiagnosed men referred for prostate biopsy. Two cohorts, one from the University of Miami (“MDSelect”) and the other from the EDRN will be used to validate/extend that the developed mpMRI based habitat risk scoring system is superior to the more standard PIRADSv2 in identifying significant cancers in the prostate.",MRI Imaging and Biomarkers for Early Detection of Aggressive Prostate Cancer,10018835,U01CA239141,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithms', 'Attention', 'Biological Markers', 'Biopsy', 'Blood', 'Body Fluids', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Trials', 'Collaborations', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Early Detection Research Network', 'Early Diagnosis', 'Early identification', 'Evolution', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genomics', 'Gland', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Habitats', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Histopathologic Grade', 'Histopathology', 'Image', 'Imaging Techniques', 'Individual', 'Indolent', 'Information Systems', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Lesion', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Multiparametric Analysis', 'Neoplasm Circulating Cells', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Predictive Value', 'Procedures', 'Process', 'Prostate', 'Prostatectomy', 'Protocols documentation', 'Publishing', 'Radiogenomics', 'Reporting', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk stratification', 'Sampling', 'Scoring Method', 'Screening for Prostate Cancer', 'Serum', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Tissues', 'Tumor Volume', 'Ultrasonography', 'Universities', 'Urine', 'Validation', 'Vendor', 'Work', 'adverse outcome', 'base', 'blood-based biomarker', 'cancer risk', 'cohort', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'digital', 'early detection biomarkers', 'genomic signature', 'high risk', 'imaging biomarker', 'improved', 'macrophage', 'men', 'novel', 'overtreatment', 'prognostic', 'prospective', 'prostate biopsy', 'prostate lesions', 'quantitative imaging', 'radiomics', 'reconstruction', 'rectal', 'tool', 'tumor', 'tumor heterogeneity', 'urinary']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,U01,2020,604709,0.24920932671605983
"Enhanced imaging and treatment of aggressive subtypes of prostate cancer Targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) with small molecules for imaging and therapy of prostate cancer (PC) has revitalized the field of nuclear medicine. Few targets have its combination of salutary attributes, namely, high concentration in malignant with restricted expression in normal tissues, easy access with recycling to and from the plasma membrane, an enzymatic active site toward which small molecules of high affinity and specificity can be designed, and biological relevance – an inverse relationship with androgen signaling while being directly related to degree of malignancy. The ureas that we initially described for imaging PSMA in 2002 have inspired a wide variety of cancer targeting species from radiotherapeutics to synthetic antibody mimics. Our goal is to use what we have learned from PSMA-targeted detection, imaging and treatment of PC to focus on highly aggressive disease, including that which does not express PSMA. We will deploy this prolific cancer target here by beginning with a project that leverages the considerable clinical data obtained during the last funding period to refine and simplify PSMA-targeted imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) – in a way agnostic to imaging agent employed. Complementing PET we will explore sensitive new PSMA- targeted agents and methods for photoacoustic (PA) imaging, which can characterize primary disease in new ways in an effort to uncover signatures that could separate aggressive from indolent cancer to prevent unnecessary surgery and its attendant morbidity. Because PC is a heterogeneous disease, in the second half of the project we will move from detection and characterization of PSMA-expressing PC to address highly aggressive, PSMA-negative adenocarcinoma and especially neuroendocrine PC (NEPC), a lethal and increasingly prevalent subtype with the proliferation of modern anti-androgen therapies. First, we will use a PSMA reporter gene strategy to track NEPC-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in order to gauge their spatial relationship to tumor, measure their expansion in vivo, and sense their microenvironment, with a view to improving this case of solid tumor CAR T cell therapy. Finally, we will use cancer cell specific promoter (CCSP) technology, which we developed for imaging and treating metastases, to enhance PSMA expression specifically within NEPC tissue so that it may become susceptible to the detection and treatment of its PSMA- expressing adenocarcinoma counterpart. In addition to using existing PSMA-targeted radiotherapy we will show how a new urea-drug conjugate we have developed can kill NEPC once it is re-programmed to express PSMA. To achieve these goals, we take the approach of beginning with a more sophisticated analysis of our clinical PSMA PET data then work toward more laboratory-based imaging and therapeutic studies also designed for translation. The team we have assembled is comprised of clinicians and scientists with a track record of high productivity and impact working together. We present a graded approach – beginning with imaging and ending with therapy – to management of advanced, aggressive prostate cancer (PC) by leveraging what we have learned over the past two decades about the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). We propose machine learning methodology to enhance clinical interpretation of PSMA PET scans for patient management, and development of sensitive, new detection methods using photoacoustic imaging ultimately to avoid unnecessary surgery. We also propose ways to improve immunotherapy for the lethal neuroendocrine subtype of PC and to re-program it to render it more susceptible to emerging PC therapies.",Enhanced imaging and treatment of aggressive subtypes of prostate cancer,9886337,R01CA134675,"['Active Sites', 'Address', 'Adenocarcinoma', 'Affinity', 'Androgens', 'Antiandrogen Therapy', 'Antigen Targeting', 'Attention', 'Biological', 'CAR T cell therapy', 'CEACAM5 gene', 'Categories', 'Cell membrane', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Clinical Management', 'Complement', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Discipline of Nuclear Medicine', 'Disease', 'Engineering', 'FOLH1 gene', 'Funding', 'Genes', 'Gleason Grade for Prostate Cancer', 'Goals', 'Human', 'Image', 'Image Enhancement', 'Immunotherapy', 'Indolent', 'Interleukin-12', 'Laboratories', 'Lesion', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant - descriptor', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Malignant neoplasm of prostate', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Nanotechnology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neurosecretory Systems', 'Normal tissue morphology', 'Output', 'Patients', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Productivity', 'Prostate', 'Prostate Cancer therapy', 'Radiation therapy', 'Reagent', 'Recycling', 'Reporter Genes', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'Solid Neoplasm', 'Specificity', 'Specimen', 'System', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Targeted Radiotherapy', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic Studies', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translations', 'Unnecessary Surgery', 'Urea', 'Work', 'X-Ray Computed Tomography', 'base', 'cancer biomarkers', 'cancer cell', 'chimeric antigen receptor T cells', 'design', 'imaging agent', 'imaging study', 'improved', 'in vivo', 'molecular imaging', 'multimodality', 'optical sensor', 'photoacoustic imaging', 'prevent', 'prognostic significance', 'programs', 'promoter', 'scaffold', 'small molecule', 'spatial relationship', 'synthetic antibodies', 'targeted agent', 'targeted imaging', 'theranostics', 'tumor', 'tumor microenvironment']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,473165,0.09922218781992632
